    "descr": "[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333640/extras/About.png?t=1721153770[/img]\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333640/extras/hoohakforgif.gif?t=1721153770[/img]\n\nCaves of Qud is a science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants. Come inhabit a living, breathing world and chisel through layers of thousand-year-old civilizations. Decide: is it a dying earth, or is it on the verge of rebirth?\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333640/extras/Features.png?t=1721153770[/img]\n\nDo anything and everything. Caves of Qud is a deeply simulated, biologically diverse, richly cultured world.\n\n[b]DEEP PHYSICAL SIMULATION[/b] — Don’t like the wall blocking your way? Dig through it with a pickaxe, or eat through it with your corrosive gas mutation, or melt it to lava. Yes, every wall has a melting point.\n\n[b]FULLY SIMULATED CREATURES[/b] — Every monster and NPC is as fully simulated as the player. That means they have levels, skills, equipment, faction allegiances, and body parts. So if you have a mutation that lets you, say, psionically dominate a spider, you can traipse through the world as a spider, laying webs and eating things.\n\n[b]DYNAMIC FACTION SYSTEM[/b] — Pursue allegiances with over 70 factions: apes, crabs, trees, robots, and highly entropic beings, just to name a few.\n\n[b]RICHLY DETAILED SCIENCE FANTASY SETTING[/b] — Over fifteen years of worldbuilding have led to a rich, weird, labyrinthine, one-of-a-kind storyworld, layered on top of the simulation, all for you to explore. Live and drink, friend.\n\n[b]TACTICAL GAMEPLAY[/b] — Turn-based, sandbox exploration and combat offers as many solutions as you and your mutations, implants, artifacts, and skills are creative enough to invent.\n\n[b]RPG ELEMENTS[/b] — Quests, NPCs, villages, historic sites; some dynamic and some handwritten, interwoven to produce a transportative RPG experience.\n\n[b]ATMOSPHERIC ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK[/b] — Over two hours of otherworldly music to delve to.\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333640/extras/CharacterCreation.png?t=1721153770[/img]\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333640/extras/Character-selection616x236.gif?t=1721153770[/img]\n\nCaves of Qud has one of the most expressive character creators of all time.\n\nPlay the role of a mutant indigenous to the salt-spangled dunes and jungles of Qud, or play a true kin descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domes — the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the ice-sheathed arcology of Ibul, or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon.\n\nBuild your character out of:\n\n[list][li]Over 70 mutations — outfit yourself with wings, two heads, four arms, flaming hands, teleportation, the power to clone yourself…\n[/li][li]Dozens of cybernetic implants (and more to find as treasure) — night vision, translucent skin, carbide fists, spring-loaded ankle tendons…\n[/li][li]24 castes and kits from across the social order of Qud and beyond Moghra’yi, the Great Salt Desert\n[/li][li]Too overwhelmed to build a character from scratch? Choose one of 9 preset characters and start your adventure right away. Then return to character creation when you are ready.[/li][/list]\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333640/extras/Modes.png?t=1721153770[/img]\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333640/extras/abilityselection.gif?t=1721153770[/img]\n\nPlay one of four modes:\n\n[b]CLASSIC[/b] — Like other traditional roguelikes, this mode has permadeath, meaning you lose your character when you die. Extremely challenging even for experts.\n\n[b]ROLEPLAY[/b] — Play it like an RPG. Save your progress at checkpoints located in settlements.\n\n[b]WANDER[/b] — Focus on exploration. Most creatures will not attack you, you don’t gain experience by killing, but you DO gain experience by discovering new locations and treating with legendary creatures.\n\n[b]DAILY[/b] — One chance with a fixed character and world seed. How long will you survive?\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333640/extras/WhatsComing.png?t=1721153770[/img]\n\nThe game is nearly complete, and there are already hundreds of hours worth of gameplay here. But before 1.0, we’ll also be adding:\n\n[list][li]The last leg of the main quest\n[/li][li]The new, fully graphical UI\n[/li][li]Hundreds of visual & sound effects\n[/li][li]Lots of polish & stability[/li][/list]\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333640/extras/QudHistory.png?t=1721153770[/img]\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/333640/extras/friendswithbugs_1.gif?t=1721153770[/img]\n\nCaves of Qud is a project of epic proportions that's been in development for over fifteen years, since 2007. It began as the science fantasy roguelike dream of co-creators Jason Grinblat and Brian Bucklew, who released the first beta in 2010. Since then, it's accrued a few more contributors who have enriched the project by helping to add visual effects, sound effects, an original soundtrack, a new UI, new game systems, new lore, and half a world of content. Caves of Qud has grown into a wild garden of emergent narrative, where a handwritten story weaves a path through rich physical, social, and historical simulations. The result is a hybrid handcrafted and procedurally-generated world that's alive in a way few games are.",
