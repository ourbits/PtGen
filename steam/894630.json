Without this resource millions of colonies will be cut off from deep space and inevitably regress to a more primitive state of being. The Empire has declared the outer rim territories a lost cause, and now every quadrant of the galaxy is preparing for war, desperate to sustain their way of life.The archives speak of an old research project conducted at the height of the Empires prosperity. A warhead with the ability to cause a cascading subspace collapse within the center of the galaxy, and create a Tacknium deposit of unparalleled wealth. Enough to supply the galaxy for countless eons and allow for subspace jumps of previously unimaginable distances. The codename for this project was Final Theory.The intended purpose of such a weapon was to usher in the age of intergalactic colonization, but the project was ultimately abandoned. The risk deemed too great since an uncontrolled cascade of such magnitude could prove devastating to the galaxy itself.The Final Theory project data remains however. Located at old Imperial research stations scattered across the galaxy. Recovering this data has now become the last hope for the abandoned outer rim colonies.As commander of a recently formed Dominion, it now falls to you to fight through these dark times and secure a future for your people. Your appointment by the Dominion high council came with but a single mandate. Ensure victory for the Dominion by any means necessary.",
