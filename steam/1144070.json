    "descr": "[b]Numb Is a First Person - Indie - Horror Game. [/b]\nAre You In A Dream? Or Not?\n\n[img]https://cdn.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1144070/extras/NumbPromo4Gif640x360.gif?t=1569600109[/img][h2][b]Synopsis[/b][/h2]James is a young man who just moved to his newly bought house in the state of California. The house originally belonged to Ms. Karen Johnson. \nThis house looks stunning and was pursued by others buyers as well, despite rumors being heard in a small community of Escondido. Some people are talking about strange situations that happened in the 1950s at this house.\n\nIt was during this time, when the famous fashion designer Tiffany Johnson resided there. Her life was surrounded by luxury but also by alcohol and drugs. Her one and only son had chronic psychological problems and had to go to a psychiatric clinic frequently. All these led to Tiffany committing suicide through drug overdose.\n\nHer granddaughter, Karen, inherited the house, but never moved in because she wanted to forget what she went through at this place when she was a child.\n\nNow James, a normal person with just some… sleep problems, will have trouble moving to a place like that. He should have thought twice before buying this house...[h2][b]More Specific[/b][/h2]Let's Talk About Sleep...\nAn average human sleeps 7 to 8 hours every day. But… Did you ever ask yourself how many of them are deep sleep hours? When we sleep our body go through many phases. \n\nFor example, one of them is REM. Rapid eye movement sleep. REM is also known as paradoxical sleep (PS) and sometimes desynchronized sleep because of physiological similarities to waking states, including rapid, low-voltage desynchronized brain waves. REM usually accounts for 20% to 25% of total sleep and lasts for 90-120 minutes. During normal sleep, we usually experience 4 to 5 REM sleep periods. The human body is in dire need of phases like REM etc., but sometimes situations like this maybe make you feel Numb. \n\nNumb will get to you in position to experience some of the sleep phases, through James, a normal person with stress problems that affect his sleep.\nAre you ready to live, or die, in a dream? Is it actually a dream, though?\nWhen someone feels numb, he can't really tell if he is living in reality or in a dream.[h2][b]Our Goal[/b][/h2]Our goal as 'Rico's Lab' team is to provide a high quality horror mini game at an affordable price for everyone.",
