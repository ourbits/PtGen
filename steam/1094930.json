    "descr": "[h2]Story[/h2]In a world where monsters thrive and wraiths run wild, and ghouls and ghosts roam the streets, there exist those who hunt the creatures that do humans harm.\n\nThe setting is a Japanese cafe in the suburbs of present-day America. Inside, there are two girls. One—Kiri Hattori—runs the store, while the other—Mary—is its poster girl. Their true identities, however, are that of a ninja descendant and a fire-hurling ghost. Together, they protect the town and hunt the Dark Beings that disturb its peace. On a certain stormy night, they offer shelter to a girl they find in front of Kiri's store. Appearing before them at the same time is the vengeful spectre—the Headless Horseman—whose story is inextricably linked with theirs.\n\nThe two of them take in the mysterious girl, Lily, and continue on with their lives. As they handle the day-to-day affairs of the cafe, a friendship begins to bloom between the three girls. However, those days do not last long. Lily wishes for a battle with Kiri. In the midst of their fight, the Headless Horseman reappears.\n\nWhat is Lily's objective?\nWhat does their entangled fate with the Headless Horseman have in store?\nAnd finally, what awaits them at the end of the battle?[h2]Characters[/h2][img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1094930/extras/01_霧立ち絵A_忍者服.png?t=1580431383[/img]\n[b]Kiri Hattori VA: Ikumi Hasegawa[/b]\nKiri is a member of the Hattori, a clan of ninjas that traces back to ancient times. She has been receiving ninja training ever since she was a child, having their techniques drilled into her as part of her upbringing. Both her skills and her mental constitutional are exceptional. She is a peerless hunter of Dark Beings.\n\nThough she had been living in Japan, she has come to America with a certain goal in mind. She spends her days running a Japanese cafe in the suburbs while fighting to protect the town's peace from monsters.\n\nShe enjoys a good binding—that is, with rope, and doing it to someone else—from time to time, which seems to suggest she has a slightly sadistic side. She also finds pleasure in teasing her partner, Mary. Whenever Mary makes a mistake, the whip-like crack of Kiri's rope sends a shiver down her spine.\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1094930/extras/02_メアリー立ち絵A_ドレス.png?t=1580431383[/img]\n[b]Mary VA: Sayaka Harada[/b]\nThree hundred years ago, Mary was wrongfully accused of being a witch and executed. As the sole bearer of her entire family's vengeful rage, she turned into a vicious ghost that terrorized all those around her until she was saved by Kiri. She has made Kiri the center of her existence ever since.\n\nShe commands fire at will, and can send them lashing out at her enemies. Though the intensity of the flames is usually under her control, when her emotions run high, she can go berserk. For a berserk Mary, the line between medium and well-done can be particularly thin.\n\nWhen the sun is up, she works as a waitress in the Japanese cafe. During the night, in true ghost-like fashion, she lives in a mirror in Kiri's room. \n\nHer favorite food is cold pizza, and anyone who dares tease her about it will surely have a taste of her fiery temper.\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1094930/extras/03_リリィ立ち絵A_私服.png?t=1580431383[/img]\n[b]Lily VA: Natsumi Murakami[/b]\nOne stormy night, Kiri finds her collapsed in front of her store. Different from Kiri’s, she uses wind-style ninjutsu. \n\nShe has partial amnesia, having lostpart of her memories, and is now a live-in employee at Kiri’s café causing a bit of trouble. \n\nEventually, she opens up to Kiri and Mary, who also learn to trust her. She has a certain goal: what could it be...?\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1094930/extras/04_首なし騎士立ち絵A.png?t=1580431383[/img]\n[b]Headless Horseman VA: Ei Mochizuki[/b]\nA towering, powerful being of the darkness that can easily swing his two-meter long zweihänder, he has enough magical strength to easily regenerate any minor damage immediately. \n\nLost his head hundreds of years ago from one of Kiri’s ancestors. His intense, deep-seated grudge keeps him alive as a being of the darkness. \n\nIt seems that he also has some kind of connection with Mary...[h2]Features[/h2][list][li]Tri-lang options: Play it in English, Japanese, or Traditional Chinese\n[/li][li]Dual-lang display: Show two different languages at once\n[/li][li]Gorgeous character art by Kiseri Matsumiya and PICPICGRAM\n[/li][li]Adorable SD art by Hoshi\n[/li][li]Exciting scenario by Ryoichi Watanabe\n[/li][li]Multiple endings to unlock, beware bad ends!\n[/li][li]Visual novel elements such as choices\n[/li][li]Set in modern day America\n[/li][li]Theme sung by AiRI\n[/li][li]Extras menu to view CGs[/li][/list]",
