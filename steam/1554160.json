She came back to visit her favorite childhood spot along with her cat Sebastian. Unfortunately, her cat ran away deep into the forest and disappeared. Eve decided to follow and saw Sebastian jump through the window of an abandoned mansion that she had never known ever existed in this forest. She realized that while the mansion is very mysterious and scary, she still needed to find Sebastian and get out of this place which contains a dark force trapped inside.\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1554160/extras/LIRE_Character.jpg?t=1666984018[/img]\nEve Antoinette is a quiet girl, as if she had no emotions.

I've been working on this project since 2018 from scratch. Because lack of budget, I split this game into several chapters with the hope that I can eventually get enough funds to develop this game continuously. With your support this game will certainly get updates to improve the story, in game quality, assets, puzzles, mechanics and much more.",
