    "descr": "Iris works as a Purifier, a person who helps souls of the deceased move on to the afterlife. Her fate changes after coming into contact with the Magicians, half-immortal beings who watch over the MO worlds. Interacting with them, the mystery of the MO worlds' origins will come to light.\n\nDon't be deceived by the lighthearted parts--despite the fun fantasy setting, MO isn't a world that will let you survive with something as flimsy as \"the power of friendship.\"\n\nThis is a story written to make you both laugh and cry. At the very least, it has a lot of puns and glasses jokes. This game has a 75% \"made me cry\" rate, according to the survey.\n\n[b]✦ Characters ✦[/b]\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1598220/extras/Untitled650.png?t=1652110131[/img]\n\nIris: The heroine. A gentle, awkward, and surprisingly brave girl who tries her best.\n\nRieffe: Iris' kind but detached childhood friend who always worries about her.\n\nLanneis: A strict and sarcastic person who glares and pushes up his glasses way too often.\n\nReqieu: Used to be Iris' teacher. Serious, but gentle and low-key sarcastic.\n\nSeptem: A serious, kind, and dutiful boy who likes flowers. He's kind of shy once you talk to him. Always polite.\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1598220/extras/BsCOTE_770_width_2.png?t=1652110131[/img]\n\n[b]✦ Warnings: light/moderate blood, themes of death[/b]\n✦ Standalone game but with references to the other Magical Otoge games (Ciel, Anholly)\n✦ Stretch goal bonus routes added for free after purchase milestones (details in the Google Form after purchasing the game)\n\nThis game is a [b]straightforward visual novel, so there's no walkthrough necessary.[/b] It will be very obvious when a choice will affect the ending. After clearing the game once, a guide will appear in the Extras that explains how to get the Good/Bad Ends.\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1598220/extras/wiMNwg_500_width.png?t=1652110131[/img]",
