    "descr": "[b] A third-person fast-paced action game by the FrenzyZone team, where the player will play an orc girl in a sci-fi city. [/b]\n\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/主角進入戰鬥場景4.png?t=1734621670[/img]\n\nThe hard-hitting style brought about by high punitiveness will force the player to understand the complete motion system of the game, making the depth of the game more prominent, and will bring more possibilities of repeated playability, and the stimulation brought by this difficulty. Will give players a higher sense of accomplishment and challenge.\n\nAs a highly difficult game, we encourage players to be active in uninterrupted battles. The various elements of the game such as weapon activity and execution, counterattack, madness, etc. are all interlocking, so that the whole game is maintained. In the stimulating battle without a cold field.\n\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/主角面對多樣組合的敵人.png?t=1734621670[/img]\n\nThere is no heal item in this game. The only way to healing from the previous mistakes is to stop the battle to kill the enemy and use the \"execution\" to kill the blood. This system will encourage the player to maintain. In the high-heat battle, but also said that in this battle, there is no option to retreat, the only way to win is to face the enemy and kill a bloody road.\n\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/主角被擊敗_遊戲結束.png?t=1734621670[/img][h2] \"Execution\": It is your only way to break the enemy. [/h2]\nWhen the protagonist attacks the enemy, it will accumulate the enemy's \"stun value\". When the episode is full, it will trigger the dizzy state. At this time, the execution can make a quick and critical strike to the target; however, the enemy's \"dizziness value\" will decrease with time. Players are constantly retreating in battle or unable to play high-connected attacks. The previously accumulated dizziness value will fall short, and even the enemy will enter a tricky \"crazy state.\"\n\nIn the execution of the action, the player will not receive any damage, and can also restore the blood volume, which is one of the main points of the combat system in this game; if this technology is used well, it can even be used to offset the enemy attack, or in the high-speed melee. Take a breather and regroup.\n\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/處決動作進行中.png?t=1734621670[/img][h2] \"Weapon Activity\": Pleasing your weapons will make them even more deadly. [/h2]\nThe active class will directly reflect the player's combat performance. Maintaining the multi-variable COMBO will enhance the active class. As the class is higher, the damage and dizziness given by the weapon will increase, and even the super-high damage can occur. One hit will kill; but it should be noted that the activity will decrease with time, which means that if the player is constantly hit or throws out of the battle, the player will be in a difficult battle.\n\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/活性五階段的薙刀攻擊.png?t=1734621670[/img][h2] \"Frenzy\": Any trauma will only make your enemies more bloodthirsty. [/h2]\nLike the players, the enemies of this game are fighting with the will to die, the enemy who is hurt will not retreat, but will enter the mad state, determined to go with you; the enemy in this state will be uninterrupted The crazy attack and the unstoppable brute force attack; if the player arbitrarily attacks, it will cause a lot of maddening enemies on the field, making the battle situation into an irreversible chaos.\n\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/敵人準備進行霸體攻擊前的提示.png?t=1734621670[/img][h2] \"Beast mode\": sacrifice your own attack power in exchange for a line of life. [/h2]\nAccumulated activity to the third stage can enter the animalization mode, the protagonist will abandon the weapon to extend the claw from the mechanical prosthetic limb, attack the enemy at high speed, and greatly increase the dizziness value and slightly restore the blood volume during the animalization, but the damage Will be reduced; in this state the main character will be hit more damage, although it is a life-saving straw in a critical moment, but it is also a double-edged sword.\n\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/進入獸化.png?t=1734621670[/img][h2] \"Counterattack\": Insight into your enemy, attack with a precise timing, and reverse the battle. [/h2]\nDashing is useful, but the effectiveness of counterattacks is even more deadly. In the game, players can attack almost all the enemy's attacks, so as to break the damage and cause the enemy to stun; but the timing is quite demanding, a failure will make you seriously injured, even lost a small Life.\n\nThis technique requires the player to see through the enemy's attack and launch it early. Even when the most accurate timing is launched, it can even make a perfect counterattack, greatly increasing the dizziness and immediately killing the enemies in front of you.\n\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/敵人霸體攻擊進行中與主角反擊.png?t=1734621670[/img]\n [h2] \"Chain execution\": The fearless knife peaks and rains, turning the battlefield into human purgatory. [/h2]\nEntering the mad enemy will make an unstoppable brute force attack, even the ordinary counterattack can not offset all the damage, is one of the most deadly threats on the field; if the player chooses to face the enemy positively, the timing is extremely accurate After launching a perfect counterattack, it will result in a highly executed chain execution, ignoring any state of all enemies, and ending any unfortunate enemies on your field.\n\nThe number of chains in the chain execution will depend on your active level. If the player is lucky enough to trigger a massacre that may even cause the battle to be emptied instantly, it is a high-risk and high-paying representative in the game.\n\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/完美時觸發的小處決.png?t=1734621670[/img]\n [h2] \"Organizational Weapon\": Smoothly transforms weapon types in two modes. [/h2]\nThe combination of traditional Japanese-style cold weapons and science fiction organs, players can smoothly switch between the two weapons.\n\nThe protagonist holds a deformable jet samurai sword and a mechanical scabbard to eject the enemy's attack by speeding up the samurai knives and the mechanical scabbard of the bulletable switch section. This design is not a simple styling feature, but the use of science fiction organs to enable the protagonist to achieve the difficult and gorgeous action that ordinary cold weapons can not make, and to turn the system of switching weapons into a special attack action rather than incompatible with the combat system. Additional system.\n\nThe jet samurai sword can be combined with a mechanical scabbard with a muzzle to form a shelling knife for the knife side. The two types have different attack speed, damage and various values; and two types of weapons Combine taps, hits, special attacks, deformations, and dodge attacks to create a variety of moves.\n \n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/主角設計3D_武士刀.jpg?t=1734621670[/img]\n\n\"Injection Samurai Knife\": Modularize the samurai sword machine and install a small turbo nozzle on the back of the knife, start acceleration in the slash or use the jet to move at high speed, and use the jet samurai knife to have a faster speed. Attack speed and high flexibility, but the weapon attack range is short, relying on its mobility to achieve more flexible links.\n\n\"Mechanical Scabbard\": It is a small hand-held railgun. It is a combination of the upper handle rail and the lower handle rail. There is a trigger next to the sheath, which gives the enemy unexpected surprises in the link. From the shelling, the scabbard can be used as a crowbar to attack the enemy.\n\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/主角設計3D_薙刀.jpg?t=1734621670[/img]\n\n\" Cannon Slash \": Connect the mechanical scabbard to the tail of the samurai sword to form a sickle in the medium-long attack range. The rear muzzle can be used as a weapon and can also be used as a propeller to spur a large number of enemies in a chaotic war. The use of a cannon has a high range and range attack, but the swinging action is large and lacks maneuverability.[h2] \"The enemy\": The army of iron and blood will come to you. [/h2]\n   The protagonist has an agile body and powerful weapons, but the enemy is not a fuel-efficient lamp. The various types of enemies and armor match each other, and special elite enemies, composed of various configurations of troops, near and medium-range different positioning enemy People walk and match each other and surround the attack.\n\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/敵人設計01(3D).jpg?t=1734621670[/img]\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/敵人設計02(3D).jpg?t=1734621670[/img]\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/敵人設計03(3D).jpg?t=1734621670[/img]\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/敵人設計04(3D).jpg?t=1734621670[/img]\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/主角在戰鬥場景5面對連攜搭配的敵人們.png?t=1734621670[/img][h2] \"City\": A mechanical demon that travels through the labyrinth and sighs. [/h2]\nThe player operates the protagonist and breaks through the barriers in the city. The level is designed as a three-dimensional map that echoes the front and back. You can see the scene of the battle just in the back of the checkpoint, which makes people know clearly that they are fighting in the same city. .\n\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/主角進入戰鬥場景4.png?t=1734621670[/img]\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1108560/extras/主角在往戰鬥場景5的途中往下看_可以看到戰鬥場景2.png?t=1734621670[/img]",
