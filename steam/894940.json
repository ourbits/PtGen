Some may want to live on a higher elevation, others may want to be surrounded by trees and water. Fulfilling the requests of your Townsfolk will earn you their hearts and unlock new relationship paths.[/li][/list][img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/894940/extras/popfinalsmall1.gif?t=1596561234[/img]\n\n[img]https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/894940/extras/skillbarSmall.gif?t=1596561234[/img][h2]Master New Hobbies & Crafts[/h2][list][li][b]Gathering[/b]: Whether you’re picking fruit or picking weeds, your gathering skill will level up!

Veggies are an essential ingredient to many cooking recipes!

As you become a better Merchant, rarer items will appear for you to buy!\n[/li][li][b]Tarott Master[/b]: Once the Dark Wizard was defeated, all of his monsters were sealed away into Tarott Cards. Many Townsfolk collect and battle with these cards, and there is even a big competition held each year in Dirboros.
