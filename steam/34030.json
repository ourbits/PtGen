The course of history relies on your ability to lead your troops through the most intense battles as never seen before in a Total War game.About The Peninsular CampaignThe Peninsular Campaign is an independent campaign based on the conflict in the Spanish Peninsula between 1811 and 1814. It was during this era that the Spanish resistance gave their style of fighting its name: Guerrilla, or the “little war”.Play the campaign from three different perspectives, each with a unique feel:•\tThe French fight to keep resistance at bay while converting regions to their political alignment.•\tThe British are very limited for regions at the start but receive enough income from Northern Europe and North America that they can afford to liberate regions back to the Spanish in return for Guerrilla aid.•\tThe Spanish also have a limited starting position but have permanent access to Guerrillas for effective battlefield use against the French.Choose one of the three nations involved - France, Great Britain or Spain - and experience one of the most intense conflicts of the Napoleonic era.Key Features:•\tA new and independent Iberian Peninsula campaign map featuring 32 controllable regions.•\t5 new Guerrilla unit types, recruitable by all nations, adept at battlefield stealth and with the added ability to deploy outside of their faction's deployment zones: Tiradores (Skirmisher Infantry), Cazadores, Lanceros (Lancer Cavalry), Husares (Light Cavalry), Leader (General).•\t28 new units in total, spread across the three playable nations including the British 95th Rifles, the French Vistula Uhlans and the Spanish Coraceros Espanoles.•\tTwo new agents to enforce political conversion:•\tProvocateurs (French and British nations only) have the ability to promote anti-opposition sentiment in regions, incite unrest, decreases turn time for research and passively spy.•\tPriests (Spanish and Portuguese nations only) have the ability to promote anti-opposition sentiment in regions and incite unrest.•\tA new Guerrillero agent for the Spanish nation: similar to a Spy but with the new ability to Harass enemy armies - lock them in place for a turn and cause them attrition.•\tPolitical Alignment system which sees the French battle to increase pro-French sentiment throughout the peninsula.About Coalition Battle PackThe Coalition Battle Pack features 6 brand new units and contains the Battle of Friedland fought between France and Russia.The Battle of Friedland (14 June, 1807) with Napoleon's empire at its height, he took a chance and defeated Russia in detail, knocking them out of the war and bringing the Fourth Coalition to an end.Unit Descriptions:•\tLifeguard Hussars: This fast light cavalry unit is best used for dealing with skirmishers and artillery who can attack from long range.•\tColdstream Guards: Disciplined, well-trained and respected, these elite foot guards inspire nearby troops in battle.•\tArchduke Charles' Legion: This highly-disciplined line infantry regiment excels at weapons drill and accuracy.•\tLuetzow's Freikorps: Swift light cavalry, the riders of Luetzow’s Freikorps are excellent in melee and on the charge.•\tLife Hussars: Sabre-armed light cavalry, the Life Hussars are powerful on the charge and effective in melee combat.•\tSemenovski Lifeguard: Immaculately turned out, these elite guards have excellent morale and are superb when used against skirmish troops and artillery.About Heroes of the Napoleonic WarsThese exclusive elite units become available on the campaign map once you have made a specific technological advancement or own the relevant territory.They will appear in both single and multiplayer game modes.•\t7th Lancers (France)•\tBrandenburg Uhlans (Prussia)•\t1st Hussars (Austria)•\t15th Hussars (Great Britain)•\t1st East Prussian Grenadier Battalion (Prussia)•\t6th Regiment d'Infanterie Légère (France)•\t17th Jäger Regiment (Russia)•\t1st Regiment Emperor's Own (Austria)•\t18th Regiment d'Infanterie de Ligne \"The Brave\" (France)•\tMoscow Musketeers (Russia)About Imperial Eagle PackThese exclusive elite units become available on the campaign map once you have made a specific technological advancement or own the relevant territory.They will appear in both single and multiplayer game modes.•\tGrand Battery of the Convention (France)•\tHMS Elephant (Great Britain)•\tTowarczys (Prussia)•\tRoyal Scots Greys (Great Britain)•\t5e Regiment de Hussards (France)•\tPavlograd Hussars (Russia)•\t8th Life Regiment (Prussia)•\t47th (Czech) Regiment (Austria)•\t88th Foot “Connaught Rangers”•\tArchduke Ferdinand Cuirassiers (Austria)•\tLifeguard Cossacks (Russia)",
