    "descr": "1872, with a steampunk twist. Phileas Fogg has wagered he can circumnavigate the world in just eighty days. \n\nTIME Magazine's Game of 2014 and winner of the IGF award for narrative; now available on Steam! Choose your own route around a 3D globe, travelling by airship, submarine, mechanical camel, steam-train and more, racing other players and a clock that never stops.\n\n170 cities to explore. Detailed research and techno-fantasy combine in an 1872 of tensions, inventions and exploration. Climb the Burmese mountains, trek the Zulu Federation, sail up the Amazon and disappear under the Indian Ocean - but don't fall behind the time! \n\n[list][li] Four times [b]BAFTA[/b]-nominated and [b]TIME's #1 Game of the Year 2014[/b]\n[/li][li] [b]Winner IGF \"Excellence in Narrative\" award[/b]\n[/li][li] \"We’ve been dreaming about this future for decades.

Bribe your way onto early departures, but don't let yourself go bankrupt or you'll be sleeping rough and begging for aid! Trade items for profit, and collect the equipment for the conditions you'll face: but too much luggage will slow you down...\n\n80 DAYS is a breakneck race, with an in-game clock that never stops running. Trains, steamers, hot-air balloons, boats, camels, horses and more leave and arrive minute by minute. \n\nEvery city and journey is narrated via an interactive story where you control every action. Will your choices speed you up - or lead you into disaster? Will you earn Fogg's trust and respect? Will you uncover the secrets and short-cuts that can shave days off your time?
