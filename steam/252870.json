    "descr": "Team up to operate a starship and explore a randomized galaxy falling into chaos. Each player assumes a role aboard the ship: Captain, Pilot, Scientist, Weapons Specialist and Engineer. Coordination between your crewmembers is essential to survive the perils that await you.\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/252870/extras/Timeline1-ezgif.com-crop.gif?t=1725150902[/img]\nControl the various stations that run your ship. Reroute power between ship systems, operate turrets, run powerful programs, scan enemy vessels for information to give you an edge in battle, or start up the warp drive to escape a fight you cannot win. The strategies you use are up to you—or your Captain.\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/252870/extras/ezgif-1-813b6e16a9.gif?t=1725150902[/img]\nEmbark on missions, investigate abandoned stations, and scavenge for components that could aid you in your voyage. Teleport down to the surfaces of planets where you may face extreme environments and dangerous creatures. Trek across the galaxy, and discover what lies on its fringes.\n\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/252870/extras/pulsar_steam_store_title_keyfeatures.png?t=1725150902[/img]\n\n[list][li]Online co-op multiplayer (1 - 5 players)\n[/li][li]Offline / singleplayer mode\n[/li][li]Customizable AI crew bots in online and offline mode\n[/li][li]Five unique classes; everyone plays a role on the ship\n[/li][li]Fast-paced and tactical ship-to-ship space combat\n[/li][li]Teleport to other ships, planets or stations to join the away team\n[/li][li]Loot planets and stations for valuable items\n[/li][li]Board enemy ships to capture them or destroy their systems\n[/li][li]VR mode (with motion controller support)[/li][/list]\n\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/252870/extras/pulsar_steam_store_title_classes.png?t=1725150902[/img][h2]The Captain[/h2]Nearly every major decision of a voyage falls into the Captain’s hands. With clear communication and resolve, the Captain must be the link that coordinates the actions of the entire crew. As the Captain determines the route the crew will take—through both the galaxy itself and the hard choices they encounter—success is more often than not a reflection of his or her leadership.[h2]The Pilot[/h2]The Pilot is responsible for flying the ship and navigating across sectors of space. Through management of different flight controls, a Pilot must maneuver the ship through debris, position it effectively during combat, and align it to the next sector for warp. Despite various flight styles in the field, most Pilots become one with their ships and make them extensions of themselves.[h2]The Scientist[/h2]Scientists provide the crew with medical assistance and information about their current environment. As they possess superior technological prowess, Scientists have the responsibility of overseeing sensor sweeps, ship security, the breaching of enemy firewalls, and research. Furthermore, their skills are invaluable when developing strategies or exploring alien planets.[h2]The Weapons Specialist[/h2]Guns, turrets, nukes—the Weapons Specialist manages them all. Operating lasers, missiles and any other combat related technologies, Weapons Specialists have the greatest direct impact in battle, and their aim can greatly sway the outcome of a fight. Apart from ship-to-ship combat, Weapons Specialists are also crucial in ship boarding and investigations of hostile environments.[h2]The Engineer[/h2]The Engineer keeps the ship running. In addition to charging the warp drive and manning the startup switchboard, Engineers must continually maintain and repair vital ship systems, as well as control ship power flow to prevent overheating. Engineers make the most out of a reactor’s capabilities and balance power allocation for the greatest possible output.",
