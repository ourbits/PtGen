    "descr": "[h2]Not your typical deckbuilder[/h2]Each aspect of your character will be needed for success. Your abilities, which are represented by your deck, determine what actions you can take in battle. As your journey continues you will grow in strength by finding new and more powerful equipment to enhance those abilities or provide other unique bonuses. Finally, through training, you will become stronger, smarter, faster and overall more effective with every action taken not only in combat, but throughout your adventure. Universally adaptable, the way you build your character along with the cards you select gives full customization allowing for mid-game changes to your build and style.\n\n[b]What choices will you make to achieve your goals?[/b]\n\n[list][li]Never be caught unprepared! An [b]RPG style potion system[/b] that allows you to carry and use them when they will benefit you the most!\n[/li][li]An item for every situation.

You alone are brave enough to face this threat head on. Your quest for salvation will be fraught with danger every step of the way but with skill, cunning and a dash of luck you will halt the advance before the kingdom burns. With little hope except the destruction of the undead leader you must traverse these hostile lands and slay the fiend before it is too late.\n\n[b]What will you sacrifice for success?[/b]\n\n[img]https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/891370/extras/map.png?t=1639437383[/img][h2]Every run is unique[/h2]Every time you embark on a new journey a random map is created, containing enemy camps, events and cities with their own exhaustible shops. As you make your way through the map, monsters will grow in difficulty and you will find better cards and equipment. However, as you explore, the undead army will slowly take over the map destroying cities and events in its wake. Exploration is key to creating a powerful character, but as the undead spread it serves to empower your foe.\n[b]What path will you take to destroy The Lost?[/b]\n\n[img]https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/891370/extras/enemies.png?t=1639437383[/img][h2]Knowledge mixed with discovery[/h2][list][li]Each unique monster has a set custom deck.
