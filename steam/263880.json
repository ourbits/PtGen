A critically acclaimed launch title for PSM (Vita).\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/263880/extras/ak_360.png?t=1622379330[/img]\nXBox version is the Sony version with extra added levels + enemies + refinements.\n[img]https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/263880/extras/ak_pc.png?t=1622379330[/img]\nPC version is the most feature rich and improves on the XBox one with new Weapons + Gradius style Arcade mode + yet further refinements and extra details (with the Steam version being unique in having online leaderboards and achievements).\n\nAll the new things we have added to the Steam version will also be rolled back into the other PC versions unless Steam specific (ie Online leaderboards, achievements, trading cards are STEAM ONLY).",
