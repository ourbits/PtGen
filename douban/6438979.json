    "introduction": "布努埃尔在西班牙参与制片的通俗歌剧商业片Since 1935 until the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, a production company called Filmófno worked with the motivation of shooting movies in the way of Hollywood studios: that means, with a contractual situation for technical staff and artists for several movies. Luis Buñuel was elected as executive producer just for training the staff but he actually took part in some scripts. This movie \"La hija Dew Juan Simón\" (\"The Daughter of Juan Simón\") is based on a well-known song of the Spanish 30's. The song told the story of an undertaker called Juan Simón who had buried his own daughter. Included in the movie is one of the legendary scenes of all times: the international famous flamenco dancer Carmen Amaya dancing over a wood table and flirting with the main male character. Carmen Amaya some years later, when she was forced to exile in America, took part in some Hollywood movies, such as \"Panama Hattie\" (1942), \"Follow the Boys\" (1944), \"Knickerbocker Holiday\" (1944) and \"See My Lawyer\" (1945).",
