    "introduction": "The films is dedicated to the capital of Kyrgyzstan - Bishkek and its young people. They have dreams how to find their ways in life. There is a couple which meets after 5 years of separation in the airport and she finds out that he has a wife and kids. There are 2 candidates for a job, but one is a son of rich and established family, so he got the place through family connections while a poor guy stays jobless. There are a grandson and grandfather who broke up a vase and try to find another one, so the mother/daughter would not notice the loss. It is all about our life, nice daily stories of a small town citizen.",
