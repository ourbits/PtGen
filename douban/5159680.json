    "introduction": "Three women in a foreign land. They hardly speak the language, don’t know the customs, but vow to be good wives to young men they barely know. The year is 1946. The foreign land is the United States.In WWII, during brief encounters and stolen moments, 6,500 American recruits married French girls even while fighting their way to Paris and beyond. An overwhelmed U.S. Army set up “cigarette” camps — Camp Chesterfield, Camp Lucky Strike — to “Americanize” the brides before shipping them to the care of in-laws they’d never met.Cigarettes & Nylons follows three young women through hope and disillusionment, love and heartbreak, to a time when even as the world was burning, young hearts were set aflame.",
