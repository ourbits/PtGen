    "introduction": "Ami James, brash and loud with a big personality and heart to match, became a household name thanks to the groundbreaking series MIAMI INK in 2005. As the first tattoo artist to gain such celebrity, Ami gave us an inside look into the tattoo culture on the hot streets of South Beach. After taking the industry by storm in Miami, this sharp-tongued, quick-tempered artist has now set his sights on dominating the birthplace of American tattoo style: New York City. Always looking for his next big challenge, Ami's new shop (Wooster Street Social Club) will be opening up right in the heart of SoHo. A new shop means hiring a whole new crew, and with that, a whole new set of problems.",
