    "introduction": "Directed by Phil Davis (Quadrophenia, The Firm) and produced by long time Ken Loach collaborator Sally Hibbin, Hold Back the Night is the story of two youngsters, Charleen and Declan, on the run from the past, their families and the police, and making their way to the Scottish Highlands. Both are damaged, abused, complex and difficult but they begin to come to terms with each other and their new found friends, including Killer, an unlovable pit-bull terrier and Vera, whose dying with is to see the sunrise on the Ring of Brodgar in Orkney. The calm, barren, beautiful landscape of the Scottish countryside gradually begins to exert its healing influence and Charleen and Declan learn to become friends and then lovers, lay to rest the ghosts of their past and trust the world again.A young woman joins a group of protesters trying to stop the construction of a highway through a forest with the purpose of having sex with their leader. But when morning comes and the authorities show up to disband the protesters, she hits a man with a log. This causes the two to have to go on the run. With the help of a sickly, but sympathetic woman, the two slip through police roadblocks. Traveling with her, they learn she is an ex-army lesbian who just wants to see a final sunrise at the Orkney Islands before her death.1. Where will you go?2. I'm Charleen3. Run for it4.
