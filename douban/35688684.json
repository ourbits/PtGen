    "introduction": "Fata Morgana is the train that arrives in Milan coming from the south of Italy. It is the train of the “southern” migrants. They arrive with packages, luggage, wives, children, in the hope of the economic boom. But there is no place for them and the city pushes them to the periphery. Few manage to find work, but new men keep coming every day.",
