    "introduction": "Harry and Meghan fled the royal family for a second chance at the private life they always wanted. But despite their escape the world kept on telling and retelling their story. In order to set the record straight they decided to create a tell-all documentary series with TV giant Netflix. Whether they wanted it or not, they stepped into a war with the tabloid press- and now what was once a healing wound between the couple and the royal family has become a great divide. On December 8th the all-access documentary series released titled, Harry and Meghan. This was the couples attempt to get across their own side of the story, from their meeting and attempts to integrate into the royal family through to their departure. The series is unlike anything seen before, only close in comparison to the Panorama interview with Princess Diana in 1995. Years of stories half-told and whispered through the media were expanded and clarified.",
