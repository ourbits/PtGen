    "introduction": "'The Three Hikers' tells the story of three Americans (Sarah Shourd, Shane Bauer and Josh Fattal) who went hiking in Northern Iraqi Kurdistan in July 2009, and were captured and held as political hostages by the Iranian Government for more than two years. Set against the backdrop of the complex geopolitical stalemate between the United States and Iran and the emergence of their crisis as an international news story, the documentary chronicles Sarah, Shane and Josh's time in prison while also telling the the very personal story of three families and their unyielding efforts to get their loved ones home.",
