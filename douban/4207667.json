    "introduction": "Om(1986)  4 mins. Colour. Sound. 16mm.\"This four minute film explores our response to stereotypes -  aural, visual and ideological.  Smith signals these stereotypes to the viewer through a chiefly associational system, which deftly manipulates the path of our expectations. The structure is stunningly simple and deceptively subtle.  We are taken on a journey from one concrete stereotype to its diametric opposite, as images transform and juxtapose to, ultimately, invert our interpretation of what we see and hear.\"   Gary Davis.\"This is hardcore cinema.\"    Peter Kubelka, ‘What is Film’ lecture series, London 2001.",
