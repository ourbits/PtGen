When the Wailing Wall comes down in a series of bomb attacks that rock Jerusalem, the event kick-starts seven years of torment that test the limits of mankind. Monster storms ravage the coasts, a horrible virus kills millions, and children mysteriously vanish into thin air. Humanity's only salvation lies in the hands of a TV reporter and his cameraman who embark on an epic journey to decode the secrets of Revelation and identify the Antichrist. If they survive, they stand a chance of witnessing the most extraordinary event of all: The Second Coming of Christ.S1 E1 - Trumpets SoundS1 E2 - Road to Babylonhttps://www.history.com/shows/revelation-the-end-of-days",
