    "introduction": "Set in Ghana, Gold Coast Lounge is a stylistically stimulating drama that follows a family of criminals who must clean up their act before the government shuts down their lounge. In so doing, murders, betrayal, secrets, rivalries rush to the fore. Shot in the noir style of 1940s American film, Gold Coast Lounge is an ambitious, statement-making feature debut by director Pascal Aka. The film merges elements of African high life, funk, jazz with the black and white picture, achieving something altogether unique.",
