    "introduction": "Film noir has taught audiences that bad things can happen in picture-perfect small towns just as easily as in the grimy big city, but rarely have filmgoers seen a film noir that’s also an ecclesiastical musical. Violent, propulsive, and gorgeous, Gass-Donnelly’s remarkable genre mash-up about a local police officer investigating a murder in a Mennonite community is filled with contemporary hymns and set amid a rural landscape of extraordinary beauty.",
