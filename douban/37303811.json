In the late 1970s, Tony Mammoth is living a good life as a gym teacher, until an avalanche ends his life during a school outing in the French Alps. Or so it seems, because Mammoth was miraculously found 42 years later, perfectly preserved under the snow. In this British comedy series, Tony is briefly a media sensation. He then decides to pick up his old life, exactly where he had to leave it in 1979. That means the same job, the same friends and even the same car.",
