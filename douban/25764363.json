The film \"Fisherman's Son\" shows life in fishing villages, fishermen, their misfortunes and joys, their harsh and full of daily life risks. From generation to generation, working tools, methods of work and the hope to once become prosperous and independent are transferred. Oscar Klyava is the son of a fisherman who fights for these ideals - a sane, with strong will and faith in a bright future. The usual Latvian fishing village of the 30s of XX century. People live here, as they did a hundred years ago: in good weather they are fishing, but in stormy weather they are sitting on the shore. They live unimportantly, barely making ends meet. Honestly they are debtors of the fisherman Garoza. A young fisherman Oscar Klyava does not want to live the old fashioned way. He dreams about a lesser, a network that can be put in a storm, dreams of a common glacier to store the catch, of independence from a wholesale fish merchant. But the fishermen make him laugh. No one wants to believe in Oscar's plans, except for the carefree adventurer Fredy. With his help, Oscar, forced to leave his home and his beloved girl Anita, nevertheless makes the network he dreamed of, and achieves a multiple increase in fishing, earning the faith and respect of even experienced fishermen. But Garoza is on his guard: the fisherman sees his Oscar as his main enemy. And the personal happiness of Oscar is in danger ....",
