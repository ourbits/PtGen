    "introduction": "Sully, former frontman of a prominent Philly punk band, struggles for a new identity after moving into an affordable rental outside of Philadelphia with Karen and their 5-year old son. Sully indulges in the distraction, when Mick, his ex-bandmate, resurfaces and requests a small favor. In a long night that stretches until dawn, Sully and Mick venture through downtown Philadelphia streets, grungy clubs and dark alleyways rehashing different versions of a lost opportunity. Engulfed by the band’s renewed debt to Dutch, an old-school anarchist with a penchant for violence, Sully must negotiate a gauntlet of violence and deceit in order to get back home.",
