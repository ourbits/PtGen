    "introduction": "osyar Ali Hasan was born and raised in the Kurdish city of Halabja in Northern Iraq. During the Iraq-Iran War, which lasted between 1980-88, millions of mines were laid on the Iranian border. Hosyar Ali loses both legs while clearing mines, but he continues to collect mines every day. Hosyar Ali collected 2,600,000 mines in 28 years.Uncle Hussein lives in Merivan, Iran. Hussein has been smuggling for years on the border of Iran and Iraq to support his family. However, due to an incident he experienced, he quit smuggling and opened a workshop and started making prosthetic feet for those who lost their feet in the mine. Many people still come to Uncle Hüseyin from distant lands of both countries and have prosthetic feet made for him. Huseyin Uncle's customers prefer prosthetic feet made of wood, which he carved with simple tools, instead of prosthetic feet made of plastic and modern technology.",
