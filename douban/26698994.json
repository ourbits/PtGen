    "introduction": "Guillaume Brohan and Michel Fortin made their fortune in the USA. As they are about to share their gold, Guillaume claims a share for his wife, and decides to leave with everything. He is surprised by Mrs. Brohan and, in a panic, strangles her. Instead of killing him right there, Guillaume says he will give him ten years to wait in agony before he comes to kill him. Ten years later, Guillaume is here, ready to kill Michel when a scream is heard: Michel's wife Claire is being attacked by the gypsy Zredsky that Michel had to accommodate by fear. Guillaume seizes the man and, as he is about to kill him, Michel shoots him. Guillaume leaves without carrying out his revenge.",
