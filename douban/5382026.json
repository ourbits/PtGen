    "introduction": "Berlin in the 1950s. Kalle, 13, lives with his family in Wedding in West Berlin. He is crazy about Wild West novels. Proudly sporting a sheriff’s star on his jacket, he is the leader of the “Teddy Gang”, a clique of boys of his age. When Kalle’s family moves to the eastern sector of the city, he finds it difficult to adjust to his new surroundings. His self-confident, gruff manner, a tendency to boast and his interest in pulp fiction don’t exactly endear him to his new classmates. A particular rivalry develops between Kalle and fellow pupil Andreas.",
