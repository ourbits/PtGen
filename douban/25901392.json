This cosmopolitan community has never seen anything quite like the Boj family with their joyful back-to-basics lifestyle.Boj is full of creativity and messy fun and since popping up as the new kid in Giggly Park he's made lots of new buddies. Everyone loves Boj's upside-downy, topsy-turvy ways. With his improvised 'Boj-a-boom' ideas Boj can solve everybody's problems, and when Boj gets boj-ing he builds friendships and bonds the whole community together like never before.",
