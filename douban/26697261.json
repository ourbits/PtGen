    "introduction": "The architect, who took up arms for the first time; the celebrated actress, who was swept along by the tide of circumstances; the famous director, who even filmed the atrocities; the pianist, whose performance was followed by thunderous applause on that day of revolution in 1956. How everyday people in Hungary and in Canada lived through it. In the picture entitled: Happy Days - Falling Stars Canadian people such as Robert Hage ambassador, George Jonas writer, Anna Porter writer, Dr. Bela Fejer and Dr. Thomas Fried tell their stories about their experiences of 1956. Also appearing is the last public interview of author Gyorgy Faludy.",
