    "introduction": "Sasha, 15, moves in with her father, a stranger whom she hardly knows and has not seen for years. Neither he nor she is happy about this, but that’s the way it is. Protesting against the decision that adults made for her, she shaves her head, puts on her grandfather’s old leather jacket and runs away from home. As she looks like this, short-haired and lost, the local teenagers – Maxim and a girl nicknamed Mouse – mistake Sasha for a boy. That’s how the girl suddenly gets a chance to enter a new world of her peers, a fascinating and sometimes dangerous one. Sasha pretends to be a different person, unaware of how far this lie will take her.",
