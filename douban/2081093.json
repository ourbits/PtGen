    "introduction": "Friday in Blackburn, a milling town in the North West. Vast machines process and weave cotton as the female workers, sift, sort and check the results. As the machines are turned off and the women leave work, one of them remarks 'Thank God tomorrow's Saturday'.On Saturday morning, children run through cobbled streets towards a horse-drawn ice-cream van. Meanwhile adults take their washing to the laundrette, young men play football and women chat to each other on doorsteps. There is also time to attend to other domestic chores like cleaning windows, mopping out the house and feeding animals.In the afternoon people go shopping in town or take a journey to the football stadium to cheer on the teams. Later that evening, the pubs are full of people drinking, singing and catching up on each other's news.",
