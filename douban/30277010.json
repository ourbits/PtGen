    "introduction": "The 1992 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 46th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1992 FIA Formula One World Championship, which commenced on 1 March 1992 and ended on 8 November after sixteen races. Nigel Mansell won the Drivers' Championship, and Williams-Renault won the Constructors' Championship, their first Constructors' Championship since 1987. Mansell became the first driver in Formula One history to win nine races in a single season. He sealed the title as early as August. Reigning champion Ayrton Senna managed three race wins but trailed Mansell, Riccardo Patrese and young German Michael Schumacher in the championship. Schumacher took the first of his 91 Formula One race wins at the Belgian Grand Prix.",
