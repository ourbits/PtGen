    "introduction": "The 10-minute film, Mad Ladders, is very much a collage itself, blending original and found imagery with a densely layered sound design, all surrounding differing notions of “revelation”. As the prophetic ramblings of an unseen narrator (pulled from her YouTube channel) recount fantastical dreams of the coming Rapture, crystalline imagery of rolling clouds gives way to heavily-processed video of moving stage sets from The American Music Awards telecasts of the 1980’s and early 1990’s.",
