    "introduction": "Born to Boogie is a 1972 concert film based around a concert at Wembley Empire Pool starring Ringo Starr, Marc Bolan and T. Rex. Directed by Starr himself, the movie was released on The Beatles' Apple Films label. Born to Boogie consists of concert footage; recording studio scenes with Ringo Starr and Elton John, filmed at the Apple Studios in Savile Row, London; and various vignettes reminiscent of The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour, shot at Denham and Tittenhurst Park, Sunninghill. The Tea Party sequence was filmed at John Lennon's estate in the same spots as Lennon's \"Imagine\" video was filmed. The actor Geoffrey Bayldon of Catweazle fame was bemused to find that things were not going to plan when he arrived for the Mad Hatters Tea Party Scene. The planned orchestra had to mime as the whole thing had not been planned too well.",
