    "introduction": "Archer Pechawis attends a funeral for his aunty on the rez, where his mom is abducted by rabid bears and converted to fundamentalist Christianity. That night, he hears a tap on the window—it's a bear named Jesus, who has come to apologize for the actions of his peers. A Bear Named Jesus is an allegory of religious interference that takes an aching yet humorous look at estrangement and mourning the loss of someone still living.源自：https://hotdocs.ca/whats-on/hot-docs-festival/films/2023/bear-named-jesus",
