    "introduction": "The talentless writer Ernst Franz fights with the beginning of his first short story. Together with his talented, but egoistic Ghostwriter and \"alter ego\" Josef Kafka he reveals the dangerous terrain of an ingenious spirit with the work. They place themselves together to the surrealist nightmare, which awaits them - a insect-similar monster named Gregor Samsa. Although \"Franz & Kafka\" are based on the little irreverent premise that Kafkas work “Die Verwandlung” was written by two humans, this film is a great homage to Kafkas writing.",
