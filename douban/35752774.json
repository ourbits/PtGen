    "introduction": "\"Alick and Albert\" explores the intersection of art, science and nature. At an exhibition of Torres Strait art in Monaco artist-activist, Alick Tipoti, invites Prince Albert of Monaco to Badu island. To his surprise, Albert accepts the invitation but it takes some years before he is able to visit Badu with a delegation from the Monaco Oceanographic Museum. Albert stays at the local motel, goes reef diving, meets with artists and talks with Elders. The two friends reflect on the similarities of their tiny communities, worlds apart but connected by the ocean. They agree to raise awareness about the global tsunami of plastic pollution and rising sea levels facing the Torres Strait.",
