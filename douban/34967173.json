    "introduction": "A two-part tape of a video performance done on January 22, 1974, at 112 Greene Street (as part of the Video Performance Exhibition), structured on a problem in game theory, a non-zero-sum game, in which both players can win or lose at the same time, one can win more than the other, and one can win at the others expense. Serra and Bell have used game theory as a way of dealing with genres of commercial TV: cops and robbers in the first part, and a quiz program in the second. – Castelli-Sonnabend Catalog (1979)",
