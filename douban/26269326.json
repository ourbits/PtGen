    "introduction": "JOHANNES lives with his father ULRIK in a small fishing town in Denmark. They live a quiet life, each minding their separate jobs in the fishing industry. Ulrik lacks the love and tenderness of a woman and arranges for the young, beautiful, Filipino ROSITA to come to Denmark. Johannes is reluctantly drawn into this as Ulrik's translator and gets closer and closer to Rosita. Rosita faithfully does everything in her power to fulfill her role in Ulrik's life and suppress the growing attraction to Johannes. Nevertheless the tension within the family intensify as Maja, Johannes' girlfriend, and Ulrik both sense Johannes' and Rosita's attraction. Ulrik decides to settle the case by marrying Rosita and face whatever consequences this will impose on his and Johannes' relationship.",
