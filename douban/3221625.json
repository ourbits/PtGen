    "introduction": "一部魔幻现实主义风格的南美故事片。虽然不算导演最好的作品，但还可以推荐一看。Bitter vision at the bleak state of affairs in a fictional Latin American city, Pandemonium, through the warped view of a completely dysfunctional family. Among them are a radical poet with no feet, a government official who still runs the country from his jail cell, an amoral mother and a beautiful young street kid who they have adopted. An angry, lyrical, surreal film that screams for social justice.Great performances through all the film, and that's always good to see. But I have to say that this is one of the most weird, almost freak, and poor screenplay that I've seen in the Venezuelan film industry... it leads you to a pessimistic, post-modern and apocaliptic future in Venezuela, where the corruption is unbearable and the poverty is out of control. Though it is very (maybe too much) original and initially interesting, doesn't have any strength to keep you asking for more... in fact, if it wasn't for the amazing performances (Amalia Pérez Díaz above all... definitely she is the best actress of Venezuela., what a work!) you'd wish the film to finish in half an hour. The prison scene with the people screaming is quite creepy and maybe the best of the film. The only good point of the screenplay is the relationship between Amalia's character with her two sons. This film probes that you can do a quite good film just with great actors and a good direction, but it's also the probe that a potential great picture may go down without a good screenplay.",
