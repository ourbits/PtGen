    "introduction": "MAKING ANGELS is a spectacular story of taking risks, finding passion and winning dreams. Dorothy is a beautiful trust fund baby who lives in the famed Algonquin Hotel with her feisty grandmother, Claire. Named after 1920's satirist writer Dorothy Parker, Dorothy encounters Wilamena, who recently left her cheating husband with nothing but a fine set of custom designed Armani luggage and a partially completed doctorate in English literature. They soon welcome Monica, an African-American novelist with a mysterious past and bad case of writers' block, and Monica's former college roommate, Sadja, a beautiful ballerina with the clock rapidly ticking on her career. The five women support each other through the courageous choices necessary to achieve the highest of arts-- hope, and the truly inspired life. As harbingers of providence, they're making art... and MAKING ANGELS.",
