    "introduction": "It’s hard to make friends as an adult. It’s even harder when you’ve gone through a rough breakup and moved across the country. We’ve all been there, and for Riley, an 11pm beer league hockey game could be just the thing to get out his rut. Take the ice with The Late Game, a feel-good comedy feature film about one night at a beer league hockey game. The best hockey movie since Miracle and the first that’s dedicated to those that continue to chase the dream in beer league.",
