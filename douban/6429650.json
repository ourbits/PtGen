    "introduction": "Seeking to escape the stifling 17th Century London court society, the beautiful headstrong lady Dona St. Columb (Tara FITZGERALD) flees with her two young children to her secluded family estate and manor on the Cornish coast on the British Atlantic shoreline. Her new freedom puts into contact with the dashingly handsome French privateer Jean Aubrey (Anthony DELON) who sweeps her off her feet and into a world of sea-bound adventure where she chances death, very different from her dull and boring life at court with her husband Sir Harry (James FLEET). Together with her enigmatic servant William (Danny WEBB), Lady Dona conceives a daring plan to steal a ship right from under the noses of the English authorities. The theft outrages the authorities who make every attempt to trap the French pirate. However, as the noose begins to tighten around the lovers, Dona is faced with the dilemma of duty and children with Harry or freedom and excitement with Jean Aubrey.",
