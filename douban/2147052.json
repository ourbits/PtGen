    "introduction": "This documentary is a trip through the original series. The whole movie is composed of short fragments showing the high points of original series. Between them we can listen to comments of actors. They talk how they felt during shooting, how they feel the series now and what is the meaning of series for the mankind. The original series is full of allegories and in this documentary they are all presented to us with straight words. All leading characters are presented, decribed and we found out what do they really represent. In last third the movies with original crew are presented and, ofcourse, what is the future of Star Trek. This documentary is full of quotes with which we get impression what Star Trek really is.
