Selling out theater venues, they weer praised in the most superb headlines by the Croatian and European press. They were filmed by Parisian 'Pathe' and Berlin's UFA... During the Nazi persecution of Jews and later German nationals' flight from communists, a dramatic friendship was born through entertainment, dance, but also anxiety. This led towards an unexpected end. Written by Anonymous",
