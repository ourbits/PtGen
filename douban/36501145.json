Other occupants of the dorm include: Max, now in his seventh year of college; Sheen, his reluctant partner; Steven, a social entrepreneur; Ramon, his cop lover; Alex, a call-center agent; and Jenny, his attentive girlfriend. They all spend the evening tucked away in solitary rooms, talking about collective experiences, sharing similar experiences. And rent is due.",
