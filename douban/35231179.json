    "introduction": "Renowned French filmmaker Celine Sciamma turns her camera inwards in 2018 for a rare documentary output celebrating her love of women's football. Following her own team, Baston & Courtoisie, as well as many others competing for the Bernard Tapine cup, the short is an ode to the group of players in it for the love of the sport, and as a gathering place, who have made Parisian women's football a lesbian haven. Cameos from several within the film industry make the film a unique but personal work for Sciamma.",
