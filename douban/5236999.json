    "introduction": "Its forests stretch from Europe to the Pacific. Its winters have vanquished the mightiest armies ever mustered. Its people have borne the excesses of some of history's most notorious rulers. RUSSIA: LAND OF THE TSARS illuminates the imperial past of the world's largest nation. At the heart of this epic tale are the figures whose names have become legend: Ivan the Terrible who expanded the empire at the rate of 50 miles-and innumerable lives-a day; Peter the Great whose sweeping reforms westernized the nation; and Catherine the Great whose rule was marked by conquest change and controversy. Filmed on location throughout Russia enriched by exclusive visits to important sites and museums and filled with commentary from renowned scholars this is a kaleidoscopic captivating portrait of a land that has endured centuries of despair and rebellion innovation and conflict.",
