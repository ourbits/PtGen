    "introduction": "A young filmmaker has just unsatisfyingly captured the last shot for her film. While the crew encourages her to celebrate, she fears that the battle has just begun. Thankfully, she knows that worrying is never the answer. Instead, she turns to a traditional, evil-warding, garlandscattering ritual to direct all misfortune away from her film.Boonyawatana’s film is a cheeky and self-referential salute to filmmaking, and to her fellow 30th Singapore International Film Festival commissioned directors, Mouly Surya and Yeo Siew Hua. Boonyawatana reminds filmmakers that all is well as long as there are passionate people by their side through collective rejection, and most importantly, beer.",
