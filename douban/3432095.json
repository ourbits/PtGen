    "introduction": "The whole family is at the beach for an outing, and each is having their own little adventure. The Captain fights the sun with his beach umbrella, in an attempt to nap. Grandpa tries to build a sand castle, but the waves keep wiping it out. Mama, after trying to defend her picnic basket, tries dipping a cautious toe into the big bad ocean, eventually needing to be rescued by the Captain. And the kids, naturally, are cooking up mischief. Their first target is that picnic basket, but their plan to use a pelican backfires when a lobster cuts the rope they were using. Then they set out to enjoy the water, but their \"borrowing\" the bottom of the safety rowboat has bad consequences later.",
