    "introduction": "Harry Macqueen's debut film is a tender and honest exploration of love and change. When Harvey (Harry Macqueen) hears that his old friend Lola (Lori Campbell) is returning home after years abroad he arranges to take her away for the weekend to the sea-side cottage where they spent so much of their youth. What follows is a touching and beautiful story of a old friendship rekindled within a new context. Hinterland is a poetic journey of self-discovery and heartbreak in contemporary Britain, a very original and visually stunning road-trip film.",
