    "introduction": "Panchi, a young woman on the cusp of a career breakthrough, is traveling back to London after a weekend away with her boyfriend, Alex. Desperate to return ahead of an important job interview, her car breaks down, and the couple accept a lift from a lorry driver (Harry). Alex and Harry instantly form a bond, while tensions between the couple begin to surface. As the journey progresses, dynamics change, and Panchi finds an unlikely ally in Harry. The wild weekend the couple spent at Alex's friend's estate, juxtaposes a more complicated story of loneliness, defiance, and a young woman's fight for independence.",
