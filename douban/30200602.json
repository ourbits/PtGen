    "introduction": "The story of Tanya, who is suddenly hit by a feeling that her existence is hopelessly devoid of meaning, is set in St. Petersburg. The city landscape provides the backdrop for Tanya's ups and downs as she takes drastic action, gets into scrapes and grows up as a result of the trials - both deliberate and accidental - that she faces. Despite our heroine's inner crisis, this is a cheery and touching film. Through chance encounters and goodbyes, old emotional ties, solitude and the discovery of sources of internal support in specific actions and circumstances, our fragile heroine grows stronger. In terms of genre, the film is a heart-wrenching, incisive confession: Tanya alternates between writing a diary and prose. Tanya 'knows how to knit' because she tries, not without success, to weave together the threads of her past and her future - or even her fate.",
