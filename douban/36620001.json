    "introduction": "The film, set in Valencia, is shot in black and white and explores the 4:3 aspect ratio, focusing on the scenic space where most of the action takes place. It is a proposal between fiction and mockumentary, in which the audience accompanies the leader of an ultra-right-wing party in the process of preparing a monologue through which she will make her ideology known to her followers. On the theater stage, she is accompanied by a director who constantly shapes her performance, articulating through small nuances, voice inflections or gestures the most convincing way to present her story in order to better persuade her audience, revealing the communication strategies, both verbal and non-verbal, used in political discourse.",
