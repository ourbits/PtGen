    "introduction": "A dream-like, yet hyper-real portrayal of a day in the life of laundry workers, both past and present, this hybrid documentary is a voyage into New York City laundromats and the experiences of the people who work there. Inspired by the 1881 protests of Black women in The Washing Society of Atlanta, the film explores the intersection of history, underpaid work, immigration, and the sheer math of doing laundry.",
