    "introduction": "\"Lost Songs: The Basement Tapes Continued\" follows five current artists as they put music to words penned by the rock legend during the Summer of Love. Showtime‘s documentary puts Oscar winner T Bone Burnett together with Elvis Costello, Marcus Mumford (Mumford & Sons), Jim James (My Morning Jacket), Taylor Goldsmith (Dawes) and Rhiannon Giddens (Carolina Chocolate Drops) to record an album of the songs a 26-year-old Bob Dylan originally wrote in 1967 for the record that became The Basement Tapes.",
