    "introduction": "The Feeling of Being Close to You 靠近你的感觉 documents an attempt at healing the trauma of touch between mother and child. Driven by a pure desire for intimacy, my mother and I talk openly for the first time about the intergenerational trauma and abuse within our lives. Present day phone conversations are juxtaposed with archival VHS footage, creating a connection between the past and a re-write for the future.",
