Not only does he want to sleep with her, but he is obsessed with the desire to look at her naked body.

After the woman has left, the narrator and observer, dressed in black, appears. It is Peter Handke, the poet. Film essay about the man - woman relationship: 'Peter Handke's most personal, most permissive and at the same time, most reserved film.",
