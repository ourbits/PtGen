    "introduction": "The story is set in Vienna in the 1920s: Kurt Gerber is a gifted student. His life in the graduation year is hampered by his new teacher, Professor Kupfer, who students refer to as \"God Kupfer\" because of his high-handed way.The mathematics teacher and precocious Kurt get into conflict very quickly. The result is a private psychological war between students and teachers. Kurt's grades for the two subjects taught by Porfessor Kupfer get to the bottom fast. Kurt's father, Dr. Albert Gerber, who is pressuring Kurt to graduate, has a heart condition. The son does not want to burden his seriously ill father with his problems and therefore has no support dealing with it. He also falls in love with a girl of same age called Lisa, but who wants nothing to do with him. The final examination is the peak of cruelty between teachers and students. Kurt believes erroneously to have failed the test and commits suicide before the results are announced.",
