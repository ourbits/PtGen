    "introduction": "Open City Documentary Festival 2023One of nine sequences of a film realised by a group of students between 8th and 14th February 1971. This scene from Open Form, entitled Game on an Actress’s Face, presents a multilayered reflection on processuality, participation, media and mediatisation. It uses the “public face” of an actress as if it was a neutral surface for a collective and collaborative artistic act. The camera shows a close-up of the actress’s face, the “players” remain outside the frame. The actress Ewa Lemańska became very popular in the early 1970s as Maryna, the fiancée of the main hero in the film series Janosik.",
