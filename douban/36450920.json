    "introduction": "Structured as a visual story that takes place across 24 hours, Good Morning Tel Aviv takes its start from the Tel Aviv nights and develops into the story of a “typical” day through its neighbourhoods, its characters, its contradictions and its prowess. A sort of endless sequence shot that – from one night to the next – attempts to draw us into the “magnificent chaos” of the city.",
