    "introduction": "Ina, the main character of Doom Doom, is a young single mom. Ina′s mother, who is mentally unstable, also lives with her. Ina feels guilty because, unable to raise her baby without her mother′s interference, she has entrusted her baby to a Christian couple she knows. Ina′s current life is hard and dark. But the film doesn′t shed light on Ina′s past; it does not deal with how she became a single mom. Rather, the film captures silently and carefully how Ina, once an outstanding DJ with unique skills, restores her territory and tries to become both a responsible mother and good daughter. Doom Doom is a movie of will, a woman′s narrative of positivity, a warm family healing drama, and a confident youth rehabilitation drama. (JUNG Hanseok)",
