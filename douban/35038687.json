    "introduction": "\"2nd Step\" is a photorealistic, \"floating\" VR film journey through space in which the viewer joins astronauts on a future mission to prospective destinations on the Moon and Mars. The film conveys an authentic sensation of how it must feel to actually be in space. \"2nd Step\" has been produced on behalf of German broadcaster ZDF and with expert advice of the European Space Agency, thus a huge amount of original data was integrated, forming the basis for the photorealistic reconstructions of the settings which are presented in an extraordinary richness of detail and authenticity.",
