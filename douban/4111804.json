    "introduction": "If you are a Pasolini fan, this wonderful documentary made in 1966 is essential viewing. It was filmed when Pasolini had just finished directing his episode \"La Terra Vista dalla Luna\" in \"Le Streghe/The Witches\" and was preparing \"Edipo Re\" and \"Teorema\". It was made by Jean-André Fieschi for the superb French TV series \"Cinéastes de notre temp\". In this intimate portrait of a personally shy man who nevertheless never winced in his courage to speak his mind (and daringly, brilliantly, at that), Pasolini lets us see why he was one of the stalwart artists and intellectuals of the 1960s and 1970s. (If you'd like to know more, do yourself a favor and read Jean Duflot's collection of interviews with him published under the title \"Pasolini: Les Derniers Paroles d'um Impie\").Here, you can see Pasolini talking about poetry, films, politics, aesthetics, philosophy, walking about Rome's \"borgate\", chatting with Ninetto Davoli, and you will be swept away by his swift intelligence, insight, modesty and charm. Evem if you are not a Pasolini fan, you cannot miss this one!",
