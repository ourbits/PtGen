    "introduction": "The sound of waves echoes in the silence. Two girls, Youngjin and Jaeyeon, go to the beach to sleep together. They appear on a trembling heavily pixellated screen, while a delicate voice guides us through a love story of apparently non-existing people. Let yourself go and be embraced by, maybe, the most minimalist film of the festival, which emphasises the importance of little details.Director Jiyeong Hong constructed an ode to love, cinema and low-fi with a soft hand and (almost) archaeological digital effects. With a buzzing sound, flickers, and layers, she constructs a very personal post-futuristic and poetic paused dance, which helps her reveal a sweet love story reflecting on the non-normative relationships. A reflection is explained as a visual caress of the audience.Javier Garcia Puerto源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/the-waves-the-sand-and-two-lovers-in-the-middle-of/",
