    "introduction": "This girl is called 'mom'. She has a small room, where her peers gather every night to say swear words to say hello to each other, and drink and smoke. What they want is the mom's room, not the mom.Home reminds the audience of Bad Movie by Jang Sun-woo and Tears by Im Sang-soo in that it deals with suggestive matters and displays rough days. However, the girl's strong charisma makes this film special. It is a small, old room but it is the only power she has to gather friends around her.Home does not miss the emotions of the mom, who wants to fit into society, who therefore strikes an attitude but is anxious to be separated from the world. That is why this film is one step ahead of other independent movies dealing with similar subjects. Actress Kim Ga-hee, who played the mom, gives excellent performance showing rough emotions as well as anxiety and loneliness. Expressing sorrow hidden behind swear words; it is definitely not easy.
