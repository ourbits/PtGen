    "introduction": "Kristína, a transgender prostitute, has a seemingly mundane, settled life. She receives clients in her tastefully decorated house, visits furniture dealers in her spare time looking for new additions to her interior, or sees friends. But a deep sadness permeates all her actions, both from the wounds she carries with her from the past and from the premonition of an uneasy future. A former theology student, Marko, suddenly and accidentally enters her life. The quasi-documentary is inspired by the life of the eponymous title character, and many scenes were created using an observational method in a natural setting and involving actor improvisation.“We really wanted to make a film where you get to meet her as a real person, a movie that’s sincere. Kristína is a non-professional actress who has a real background in the role she portrays. She shot the scenes in her own apartment, but all the events are fictional.” (https://variety.com/2022/film/global/nikola-spasic-kristina-1235441975/)源自：https://www.ji-hlava.com/filmy/kristina",
