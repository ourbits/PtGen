    "introduction": "A lonely composer commits suicide in his apartment. By means of a webcam that the victim mounted on a tripod and pointed at the middle of the room, we are able to follow the commotion that subsequently takes place in his flat. This original, low-budget movie, packed with snappy dialogue and functioning as a window onto the “Balkan mentality,” is shot entirely in one take.",
