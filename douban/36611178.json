Several months into the program, she discovered that inappropriate photos of herself had been posted online. Enraged, she grabbed a gun and sped off towards confrontation. Moments before making a tragic decision, she remembered the tools she learned in TAPP. Tanya identified her emotions, channeled her strength and put the gun down.",
