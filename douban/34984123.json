    "introduction": "THE PLOT: After confronting her best friend for cheating with her husband, Lorraine (Danielle Korda) heads to a theatre to watch the latest horror movie, which features a team of Satanic cheerleaders (Jennifer Wright, Janessa O’Hearn, Laura Leone Hancock, and Kacie Heart) who murder and cannibalize their way through a wild and weird “cheerleaders’ retreat”. Meanwhile, Lorriane’s sanity snaps and she begins to dispatch bloody revenge of her own, unaware that she’s being manipulated by a gory alien sex parasite that has been infecting each of her sexual partners. As both stories play out through parallel worlds of insane horror, neither of the realities are what they first seem to be, leading to an explosively bloody climax.",
