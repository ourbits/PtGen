    "introduction": "Very much a Korean version of \"Tootsie\"....Park Jin-Wu, is a handsome young Korean playboy/womanizer who dreams of becoming a model/actor. However, his role is behind the scenes...working as a computer special FX programmer. Due to a computer glitch, he accidentally gets a print-out of his face and body morphed with that of a female model. Just for kicks, he sends in the picture to an audition, and ends up cast in a movie as the sexy, female lead. With the help of his best friend, Jin-Wu simultaneously tries to become a movie star, maintain a double life and hold on to his pretty pianist girlfriend. (Not to be confused with the Japanese horror film from 1999 titled Odishon, or Audition in English.)",
