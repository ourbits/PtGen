    "introduction": "In modern day London two rival gangs battle for supremacy, but with no clear victor a chance encounter with one gangs grandfather late at night adds a new spin. Now two sets of aging gangsters who have not seen the battlefront of gang warfare in three decades battle it out 70's style. Knee-capping, Chelsea Grins, and being buried on motorways are the order of the day. The silver pound has never been such a highly contested prize.",
