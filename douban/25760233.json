    "introduction": "Unstoppable is an 2013 American documentary film hosted by Kirk Cameron. Directed by Darren Doane. Inspired by the death of a close friend who succumbed to cancer at age 15, Cameron (who also wrote the script) has stated that his mission for the film is to answer the question of, \"Where is God in the midst of tragedy and suffering?\" The film is being made in partnership with Liberty University and was released for a one-night-only screening in theaters on September 24, 2013.Unstoppable grew in popularity when links to its official website were blocked from Facebook and the trailer was removed from YouTube. After widespread news coverage and outrage from fans, the Facebook block was lifted. Spokespeople for Facebook said that the domain name purchased for the film was previously used for spam, and the link was reinstated after a short period of time. YouTube reallowed the trailer, but did not make a public comment.",
