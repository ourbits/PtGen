    "introduction": "Sherlock Holmes is approached by a government Minister, Mr. Trelawny Hope, who has had an important document stolen from his dispatch box. The box was in his bedroom at the time of the theft but was left unobserved for several hours. The document is of the utmost sensitivity and could have a serious impact on European affairs. Holmes is surprised when Lady Hilda Trelawny Holmes calls on them to get information about her husband's current situation. Holmes is unable to help her, but the murder of Eduardo Lucas, a possible go-between for the stolen document, leads him to the thief. Written by garykmcd",
