    "introduction": "Germany 1927German intertitlesDocumentary form100 min · Black/White · 35 mmNew PrintBack home, three women fear for their husbands’ lives as arctic researchers Larsen, Svendsen, and Eriksen set out on a dangerous expedition to the Arctic. In Greenland, they hire Inuit dog handler Milak. The plan is for Svendsen to travel north along the coast by ship, while Larsen, Eriksen, and Milak drive towards the far north with dog sleds. In a race against a competing American expedition, they brave snowstorms, crevasses, and polar bears as they weather one adventure after the next. But then their supplies run out ... Critics of the time called Milak, der Grönlandjäger the German answer to Robert Flaherty’s Nanook of the North (1922). Filmed largely on location in Greenland and Norway’s Spitsbergen archipelago, the film combines impressive landscape footage with ethnographic observation. With their athletic way of filming in the open air, the camera staff from Arnold Fanck’s “Freiburg camera school” used the natural world as a key player, even blowing up ice sheets to create high drama. They were helped along the way by a polar bear sourced from Hamburg’s Hagenbeck zoo.WITHWaldemar CosteHarry BellinghausenRuth WeyherLotte LorringNils FocksenIris ArlanHelmer HanssenRobby RobertSepp AllgeierAlbert BenitzRichard AngstCREWDirectorsBernhard Villinger, Georg AsagaroffScreenplayArmin Petersen, Bernhard Villinger, based on true events during the expeditions of Scott, Mawson, KochDirector of PhotographySepp Allgeier, Albert Benitz, Richard AngstPRODUCED BYUniversum Film AG (Ufa)Berlin, GermanyFilm Print: Bundesarchiv-Filmarchiv, BerlinDATES240095 Sat Feb 24 17:00CinemaxX 8 (E)Music: Günter Buchwald250383 Sun Feb 25 12:00ZeughauskinoMusic: Günter BuchwaldKEYGO TO:MY PROGRAMMEBERLINALE APPSAndroid    iOSTOPICS OF THE BERLINALEInterviews with section heads and articles on the thematic focal points 2018 [...]MY ACCOUNTLOGOUT",
