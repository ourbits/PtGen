The episodes will be between 3 and 4 minutes in length, and two will be released a week..The action continues with a gripping 10 part web series of Battlestar Galactica. \"The Face Of The Enemy\" is filled with astonishing revelations you won't see on the show. Lieutenant Gaeta is sent off in a raptor with a handful of strangers when one of them mysteriously dies. The psychological human vs. Cylon struggle ensues in the restrictive confines of a raptor as everyone is a suspect and paranoia sets in among the group. One by one more passengers die under puzzling circumstances and those remaining must ask themselves if a Cylon is responsible for the deaths, or if it is one of their own — a human.",
