    "introduction": "The Phantom (1943) is a Columbia Pictures 15 chapter serial starring Tom Tyler in the title role. The serial is based on Lee Falk's comic strip The Phantom. The serial also features Jeanne Bates as the Phantom's girlfriend Diana Palmer, and Ace the Wonder Dog as the Phantom's trusty German shepherd Devil (who is a wolf in the original comic).Professor Davidson plans an expedition to find the Lost City of Zoloz. The location of the city is contained on seven pieces of ivory, three of which Davidson already possesses. Doctor Bremmer, however, intends to find the lost city and use it as a secret airbase for his unnamed country. To remove him as an obstacle, he kills The Phantom, only for his recently returned son, Geoffrey Prescott, to inherit the family identity and take over the mantle of The Phantom.Three of the remaining ivory pieces are owned by Singapore Smith, who initially steals Davidson's pieces. The seventh, and most important, piece is missing at first but turns up in the possession of Tarter (which The Phantom acquires by wrestling Tarter's pet gorilla).The Phantom - chapter 01 - The Sign of the SkullThe Phantom - chapter 02 - The Man Who Never DiesThe Phantom - chapter 03 - A Traitor's CodeThe Phantom - chapter 04 - The Seat of JudgementThe Phantom - chapter 05 - The Ghost Who WalksThe Phantom - chapter 06 - Jungle WhispersThe Phantom - chapter 07 - The Mystery WellThe Phantom - chapter 08 - In the Quest of the KeysThe Phantom - chapter 09 - The Fire PrincessThe Phantom - chapter 10 - The Chamber of DeathThe Phantom - chapter 11 - The Emerald KeyThe Phantom - chapter 12 - The Fangs of the BeastThe Phantom - chapter 13 - The Road to ZolozThe Phantom - chapter 14 - The Lost CityThe Phantom - chapter 15 - Peace in the Jungle",
