    "introduction": "\"Get Better: A Film About Frank Turner\" is a yearlong character study of one of the hardest working musicians on earth. Encompassing footage from friends, family and fans across England, Europe and the USA, film maker and friend Ben Morse set out to capture a band who are constantly in motion, only to find that they suddenly stopped. Forced to pause for the first time in ten years, 'Get Better: A Film About Frank Turner' explores what drives a man to stay on the road, and what that means for his life and those around him. In candid interviews, Frank, the band and everyone they meet explore what drives someone ever onwards.",
