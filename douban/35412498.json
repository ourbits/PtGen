    "introduction": "Jos Stelling's entry into the world of film was effective. The world premiere of his debut film “Mariken van Nieumeghen” took place in 1975 in the Cannes competition programme. Nearly fifty years later, he says the latest film will be his last. It is a shame if this is true. “Natasha's Dance” is a powerful masterpiece, a tribute to the film d'auteur, which he has consistently cultivated as a director. But not just in his works. Stelling also owns several art-house cinemas in his hometown of Utrecht, where, of course, the film d'auteur plays an important role.When Daantje was a withdrawn child, her mother told him that somewhere there was a girl waiting for him who danced beautifully. As an adult, Daantje is a lonely homeless person who happens to meet the former ballerina, Natasha. At first, the woman does not pay much attention to Daantje – the young man is a bit strange. Besides, Natasha has emotional hardships in her relationships. Then an event occurs that makes her want to return to her homeland immediately. Daantje goes with her.",
