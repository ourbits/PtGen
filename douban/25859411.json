    "introduction": "The most successful Honduran movie of all time, Who Pays The Bill? is the new and raucous comedy by director Benjamin Lopez that looks at the dreams of three friends: Dora (Sandra Ochoa), Saul (Jorge Flores), and Salvador (Oscar Izacas). Each has his or her own idea (often mistaken, often hilarious) of how to get ahead in life. Eventually they come to the realization that, for their dreams of the future to happen, someone will have to pay the bills. But who? A delightful comedy from the talented production team that brought Love and Beans to our Festival in 2011.",
