    "introduction": "\"Ted\" (Breck Stewart) is in therapy because he keeps having awful nightmares of atomic bombs. With the help of his psychatrist, he's transported back to a past life, when he was a bombardier on a secret mission to drop the little-known third nuke on Japan in 1945. Ted's also madly in love with his \"straight\" co-pilot \"Anthony,\" but he couldn't possibly ever express his affection. The fateful day arrives on the bombing run, where Ted and Anthony consummate their mid-flight love and lust for each other",
