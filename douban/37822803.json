    "introduction": "BOSS RIIZE is a one-of-a-kind variety show where the members vote to crown a “Boss”,” the absolute ruler of the trip, and follow the rules set by that leader. “BOSS RIIZE”, which premiered in August 2024, took fans on a healing-yet-competitive journey to Gangneung and Yangyang, mixing RIIZE’s signature charm with fiery rivalries—and earned an overwhelmingly positive response.Now, the stakes are higher than ever, “BOSS RIIZE: SHANGHAI IMPOSSIBLE,” levels up with a bigger scale and the most ambitious missions yet, with new episodes dropping every Friday. And of course, international viewers can catch the series on KOCOWA+, bringing the chaos, strategy, and laughter straight to your screens.This time, the members split into two groups: the group led by the chosen ruler and the “Worker Group,” which must follow along. As they battle it out in 3:3 challenges across Shanghai, fans can look forward to seeing how much the members have leveled up since tasting “the power of authority” last season, whether through sharper strategies, stronger teamwork, or even bolder persuasion.",
