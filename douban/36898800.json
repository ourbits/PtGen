    "introduction": "The French take Lebanon over from the Ottoman Empire and decide to flood a village in order to supply electricity to the new nation. Little do they know of the mess this will bring to the lives of these villagers, the Laban family. In order to survive, Adnan proclaims himself a priest in the monastery, Fawzi decides to join the English southlands, Yussef the village chief, tries to untangle the villagers’ knotty family tree—while his daughter, Areej, tries to find her place and identity in all this confusion. The village microcosm will break down into many conflicting pieces—a nightmare that will force the villagers to reexamine their identity and the history that defines them.",
