    "introduction": "Inge Herold is in her mid-thirties. She is divorced and lives with her 15-year-old son. She works as a psychologist and social worker and is involved with a married man. Suddenly, Inge finds out she may have breast cancer, which would mean an operation the very next day. The 24 hours before the planned surgery puts her under enormous psychological pressure and she begins to reevaluate her life. With heightened awareness of matters of everyday life, she realizes that what she previously considered meaningful, was actually void of any real meaning. Her relationship with the married man is particularly on her mind. By questioning much of what has been important to her up to now, Inge achieves a high level of sincerity with herself. Moreover, she finds a faithful confidant in her son who provides much needed sympathy and understanding. Although the anxiety remains, Inge Herold finds the strength to face her illness with a strong will to live and to make consistent decisions in her life. Shot exclusively on location using lay actors. Christine Schorn of the Deutsches Theater in Berlin plays the leading role, delivering a sincere, understated and powerful performance.",
