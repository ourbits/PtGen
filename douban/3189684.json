    "introduction": "As Dali was well aware, time is like a jelly; it changes shape, melts, transforms, alters, moves continuously, and not always forwards. Cinema too knows more than a little about time. Darío Stegmayer, director of El balancín de Iván , recipient of over 40 festival awards, mixes the Alterio family (with Malena and Ernesto from his previous short alongside the Bottos, seemingly demonstrating that he's quite at home with family offspring) and Mariví Bilbao to tell the tale of a brother and sister, or two tales of a brother and sister who are one and the same person, or maybe three people, at a moment depicted as indefinite and timeless right from catching our very first sight of the old Renault in which the two set out to collect an inheritance and get lost - or maybe found.",
