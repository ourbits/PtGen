    "introduction": "For some the world is not as simple as being pink or blue. Paul is the proud father of Charlie. But when he discovers that Charlie is secretly struggling with Gender Dysphoria (born the wrong gender) he begins his own struggle to discover what being a father really means. This 20 minute short juxtaposes the preparations for a big sister's wedding, the most feminine day of a girls life, with a young boy's struggle to claim his true identity. Something Blue is a moving and uplifting film that makes its audience reconsider its attitudes to things outside the accepted norms and rejoice in the pain and beauty of a parent that loves its child unconditionally.",
