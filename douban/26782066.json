A young woman calls to him from a love seat on the front porch of a large house across the street. She's barefoot, sucking on a watermelon lollipop. He goes over to her and the verbal fencing begins. It looks like it's headed for a kiss, but he's going steady with someone else and she may not be exactly what she seems. By the end, someone has to weigh conflicting information and make an important spring-day decision.",
