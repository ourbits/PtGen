    "introduction": "Iconic American filmmaker Kenneth Anger has inspired generations of creative storytellers since the late 1940s.

In this intimate documentary, Anger lets us in on his fascinating life story, his approaches to filmmaking, and his relationship to British occultist Aleister Crowley.A film by Carl Abrahamsson, Sweden, 2019. 48 minutes. Camera/sound by Åsa Ersmark, Carl Abrahamsson, Brian Butler. Color grading by William Tottie. Music by Sinnelag. Written, narrated, edited, produced and directed by Carl Abrahamsson.",
