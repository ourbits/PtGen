    "introduction": "Argentina's Patagonia is known for its landscapes and fruit production, but there’s also a hidden menace thriving; the world's fourth-largest shale oil and second-largest shale gas reserves. 'This is Fracking' shows a yet untold story, exposing the climate colonialism perpetuated by European oil companies banned at home.Amidst record profits, local communities endure earthquakes, pollution, and health crises from fracking. From the Mapuche Indigenous People to Vaca Muerta's fruit producers, the film confronts the devastating impacts and environmental injustices, challenging the silence that shrouds Patagonia's fracking reality.",
