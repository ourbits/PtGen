    "introduction": "Oleg Efremov traditionally staged the play with which the Art Theater \"began\", a play that has become perhaps the most important in the world drama of the twentieth century, to the extent that a deep and accurate reading of the text is traditionally done. Resumed in 2001, the play did not lose its Ephraim depth, but gained a second wind thanks to the actors. The masters of the stage read the immortal images of the Seagull in their own way, preserving the drawing of roles given by the director and the general atmosphere of the production. The performance breathed in the rhythm of today thanks to outstanding acting works that deserve the closest attention of the public.",
