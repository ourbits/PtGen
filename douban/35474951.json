    "introduction": "In this filmic essay, Jon Bang Carlsen explains his approach to reality. In the film’s narration, Carlsen states: “I can only see the world by illuminating it with myself. Therefore, my shadow is always a big part of the finished film, and therefore my films have nothing to do with truth. They are my perceptions of the world, nothing else.”",
