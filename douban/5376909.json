    "introduction": "Hisashi Tenmyouya: Samurai Nouveau presents a look into the artist Hisashi Tenmyouya and his NEO-Traditional Japanese Painting style. Tenmyouya breaks out of old, conventional stereotypes and inherits the distinctly Japanese counterculture and eccentricity. He incorporates modern art, traditional Japanese painting, street art, and illustration, being an artist that simply cannot be classified into a single genre. Throughout this film he uses gold foil and fine brushes to prepare for various exhibitions while people surrounding the artist share their thoughts. Watch Tenmyouya as he reveals his soul through melding of modern urban subjects with traditional painting methods.",
