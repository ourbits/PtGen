    "introduction": "Gilles Perret has always associated the name \"Walter\" and the word \"resistance.\" Even before knowing what the latter meant, Gilles knew that his neighbor had been sent to a concentration camp called Dachau. Through this story of Walter Bassan, a former resistance fighter and concentration camp internee from the Haute-Savoie, set against the current political backdrop, two questions are constantly asked: \"What have we done with the ideals of the National Council of the Resistance?\" \"Can the act of resisting combine with the present?\"",
