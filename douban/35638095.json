    "introduction": "The series will follow Slovak prime minister Viktor Hudák as he ends his political career and returns to normal life. He soon finds out he does not wield power in his private life the way he was used to as the head of the government. Scriptwriter Zuzana Dzurindová is the daughter of former Slovak prime minister Mikuláš Dzurinda. “She has first-hand experience of what it means to live in a family with a professionally exposed father. And she is not afraid to write about it,” said HBO Max producer Tereza Polachová.",
