    "introduction": "Innocence Unprotected is composed of footage of the 1941 film of the same name. Innocence Unprotected was originally filmed in 1941 under the title Nevinost bez zaštite which was meant to be the first sound feature film made in Serbia.Nevinost bez zaštite was made by the Yugoslav gymnast Dragoljub Aleksić, who wrote, produced, directed, and starred in the film. Nevinost bez zaštite was never released due to the Nazi censors while ironically later during the Yugoslav communist period some accused and condemned it as being pro-Nazi.In 1968 filmmaker Dušan Makavejev found the film and expanded upon it with newsreel footage of Nazi Propaganda and German occupation as well. Other footage includes Aleksić performing his acrobatics and filmed interviews of the surviving cast members. Makavejev tinted some of the black and white scenes in the film and hand colored some details. The film was referred to by Makavejev as a \"montage of attractions\", with a montage styled celebration of Serbian customs, folklore, and humor.",
