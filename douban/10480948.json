    "introduction": "On the coast of northern Peru, an exotic branch of agriculture has sprung up: asparagus farming. Glacier water is diverted from mountain streams to the parched desert soil of Trujillo so that the asparagus can grow. Peruvians aren’t fond of asparagus and the harvest is almost completely exported to richer countries in the North. In this documentary we follow the production cycle at a local level and are given a look into the lives of the farmers and factory workers that are trying to survive.",
