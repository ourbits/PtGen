    "introduction": "\"This fascinating animated film dramatizes Erik Erickson's eight periods of the human life cycle. Since the appearance of Childhood and Society in 1950, the most widely known and read psychoanalyst in America today has given us glimpses of his vision — a well thought out myth of the organic wholeness of life as it develops from infancy to old age and death. Erickson's understanding of how human beings purse their own humanity by confronting themselves and society in a continual quest for identity is the focus of this TV special.Cartoonists John and Faith Hubley are equal to the task. This very talented couple have tackled a host of important moral problems through their cartoons. Their success demonstrates the appeal of animation to people of all ages. Some of their short films include 'Adventures of an Asterisk' (1957) dealing with the nature of conformity; 'The Hole' (1963), a parable focusing on the dangers of nuclear disaster; and 'Eggs,' an examination of population growth and the future. In 'Everyone Rides a Carousel,' they have used pastel colored animated characters to show the drama of the life cycle.The Hubley's take the metaphor 'the carousel of life' as their starting point. Each of the eight rides in a lifetime has its peculiar conflict as the individual develops personhood. 'The Ride of the Newborn' is concerned with the conflict between trust versus mistrust; 'The Ride of the Toddlers' with autonomy versus shame and doubt; 'Childhood's Ride' with initiative versus guilt;'The School Bell Is Ringing' with industry versus inferiority; 'The Challenge of Adolescence' with identity versus role confusion;'Young Adulthood' with intimacy versus isolation; 'Grown Ups' with generativity versus stagnation; and 'Ride of Old Age' with ego integrity versus despair. Families will want to discuss the various vignettes in the rides and share feelings and ideas about the best ones. This TV special is both instructive and entertaining — a family film in the best sense of the term.\"",
