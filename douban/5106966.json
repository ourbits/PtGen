Aerial photography of Mt. Kenya is included in the film, as are scenes of a Masai village burial of two villagers killed by rhinoceroses.

Kilimanjaro is followed by a visit to a Pygmy camp and a trip to what is claimed to be the largest baboon colony ever found by an explorer. The film also includes footage of thousands of flamingos taking to the air. Alligators, hippopotamuses, wildebeests, impalas, zebras, jackasses, giraffes, lions and many other African wild animals are shown in their natural habitat.",
