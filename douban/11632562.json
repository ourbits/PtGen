    "introduction": "This film is the first to take the complete musical work of Theodorakis whose oeuvre is surprisingly little known. The consideration of Theodorakis will always go above his person and creative activity. In this regard, the film is a sketch highlighting a unique body of work in musical history. It gives a concentrated overview of his 70-year-long career. His music and life both cannot be presented without the context of European-Greek history. The film approaches Theodorakis by letting the composer expound and letting the music and images speak for themselves. This is a cinematographic attempt to live up to the fascination of this wonderful man.",
