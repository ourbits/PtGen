    "introduction": "A clash of grey communist reality with the American dream. A nostalgic story of Staś, a welder, who left Poland in the 1970s to start working in ‘Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey’, the biggest and oldest travelling circus in the world. However, everyday life turns out less than dreamy. Working in the travelling circus entails living constantly in almost one-kilometer long train which also carries all the animals. And your wages are lower than the unemployment benefit. In spite of all that, Staś remains optimistic and, equipped with a camera, records his crazy life abroad for the family he left behind in Poland.",
