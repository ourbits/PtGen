    "introduction": "Susana and Nélida met in a convent. They abandoned their calling and adopted 3-year-old Erika. They were happy, but in 2006, the women were accused of a crime and sentenced to 20 years in prison, although they maintained their innocence.Agustin Toscano delivers an original narrative that will surprise and move you. The story unfolds in multiple layers, sailing between the mystery of the past and the promises for the future. Our characters reflect on the present and the life that once was while luring you into the net. Are they confusing reality with their wishes, are they telling the truth, or are they just performing in a soap opera?One of the most intriguing films of the festival. Is it a documentary, fiction, or a musical? “I Trust You” is pure cinema, an original gem.Javier Garcia Puerto源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/i-trust-you/",
