    "introduction": "Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus consisted of two 45-minute Monty Python specials produced by WDR for West German television in 1971 and 1972. The two episodes were first broadcast in January and December 1972, respectively. They were shot entirely on film, mainly on location in Bavaria and in the German language, although the second episode was originally recorded in English and then dubbed into German. According to the Python's autobiography The Pythons, this was due to the fact that only John Cleese and Michael Palin could be easily understood by the German audience during the first episode. The other Python performers all had very thick accents (particularly Terry Jones), making them difficult to understand. According to the book in some cases the episode was even broadcast with German subtitles. Some of the material was reworked from At Last the 1948 Show. Footage from these specials was used to fill time between live stage performances. At one point the team considered editing the two shows together, dubbing them completely into English and releasing them as a 90-minute film, but it never came about.",
