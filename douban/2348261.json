Analyzing this global pop culture phenomenon, JUST FOR KICKS is the first film of its kind to present the underlying culture and personalities that fueled this fashion revolution and its $26 billion global market. Far from a formal history of the sneaker industry, JUST FOR KICKS offers a fun and colorful insider's history of hip hop's most treasured fashion item; revealing behind the scenes stories with exclusive testimonies, never before seen footage and the charismatic personalities that have come to influence pop culture.",
