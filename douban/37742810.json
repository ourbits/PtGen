    "introduction": "16-year-old Lilly-Marie and her boyfriend Pascal escape from the \"Siebenschläfer\" youth home during the night. The next morning, Lilly's body is found dead in a nearby lake. 17-year-old Pascal is on the run. Leonie Winkler and Peter Michael Schnabel begin the investigation and initiate a manhunt for Pascal. At first glance, the \"Siebenschläfer\" presents itself as a model home. Under the direction of Saskia Rühe, children and young people who have had a difficult life so far live there. Kindergarten teacher Jasmin Hoffmann is deeply affected by Lilly's death. She reports that Pascal is considered difficult and aggressive. Therefore, he, like other children in the home, is being treated by psychiatrist Lukas Brückner. The manhunt for Pascal is in full swing when another crime occurs: The head of the youth welfare office responsible for the home, Torsten Hess, is found murdered.",
