    "introduction": "Tracey Emin has long had a fascination with the Norwegian expressionist and painter of The Scream, Edvard Munch: in her words, “I’ve been in love with this man since I was eighteen”. This haunting video is an homage and reference to Munch. Emin lies naked in a fetal position on the Jetty outside Munch’s house in Åsgårdstrand, the site of many of Munch’s well-known works. An incessant cry deplores her aborted children.",
