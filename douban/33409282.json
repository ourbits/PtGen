    "introduction": "A monumental film portrait of the hundred-year-old Dragica Srzentic is composed of conversations, statements, reconstructions and animated images that are sometimes replaced by photos. Through a unique chain of circumstances, this sharp-witted lady, born in Istria, was present at a series of key events that shaped the fate of Yugoslavia in the period before, during and after WWII. The heroine's incredible life story thus reveals already forgotten moments of Balkan history and examines the labyrinths of the intellectual and political life of the eight states and systems she lived in.",
