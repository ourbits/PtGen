    "introduction": "After making its highly acclaimed, wide-reaching presence at the MAMI International Film Festival in Mumbai; the Newport Beach Film Festival and having enjoyed a centerpiece screening at this year's Osian-Cinefan festival held in New Delhi, the Anupam Kher and Dee Wallace starrer, AMERICAN BLEND is all set to hit Indian theatres on September 29, 2006.Under the banner of White Stripes Entertainment Ltd, AMERICAN BLEND is produced by Krishna Datla and Vishwaas Paandya who is the Associate Producer. Executive Producer is D Vasant Kumar and it is written and directed by Varun Khanna, who won the \"Best Writer/Director/Achievement Filmmaker Award\" at the 2006 Riverside International Film Festival in California for this movie.Being acknowledged as one of the first films made by an Indian production company under the rules of the American Screen Actors' Guild, AMERICAN BLEND is a music and dance celebration of a cross-cultural Indian-centric immigrant family living in Los Angeles, California. This 99 - minute film stars Anupam Kher who delivers a sterling performance as an Indian restaurateur hopelessly in love with his second wife - an American Indian classical dancer played by internationally acclaimed star Dee Wallace Stone of E.T and 10 fame, who have raised their children in a traditional Indian way.The film also stars Ranjit Chowdhary, David Oyelowo, Kristin Erickson, Sunkrish Bala, Amita Balla and Ruben Garfias and has an unusual rap-tap-hip-hop soundtrack composed by Abu Malik.Anupam Kher who plays a chef in the movie is excited about his latest venture and says, \"This isn't just a funny film; it's a slice of life where fun is a natural ingredient\". Sharing his experience about the movie, he further comments, \"The exciting thing was the role of a 50-year-old Raj Chaddha and the emotional highs and lows he goes through in keeping his family together. This is certainly not another desi film made abroad\".Excited about his first movie production after his stint with television, actor-producer Vishwaas Paandya says,\" In today's world of terror, comes a musical drama-edy which subtly gives out a message of co-existence, through a cross cultural family living together in Los Angeles\".\"It is a feel good film that brings together the best of India and America. It is a celebration of Indian compassion and our cultural heritage,\" is how the Writer-Director, Varun Khanna would like to sum up his second venture, AMERICAN BLEND after the success of his directorial debut BEYOND HONOR.",
