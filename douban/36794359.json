    "introduction": "This short animation comprises flashing white text against a black background. The words are drawn from a manifesto by Ted Kaczynski, the American terrorist known as the ‘Unabomber’ who targeted universities and aeroplanes from the 1970s to the 1990s. In an ironic gesture to Kaczynski’s distrust of technology’s dominance in modern life, Peggy Ahwesh ran the manifesto text through a spell-checker, using the output as the video’s script. The work provides a portrait of the Unabomber’s fixations—made clear through repeated words like ‘leftism’ and ‘technophiles’, alongside racial epithets and the names of various revolutionary figures—with an unsettling mix of violence and mechanical detachment.",
