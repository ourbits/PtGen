    "introduction": "Polish Comedy king Cezary Pazura presents a hectic tale of policemen, gangsters, a hit man and a whole lot of screen blood!It's going to be a weekend to remember for handsome gangsters Max (Pawel Malaszynski) and Guli (Michal Lewandowski). The guys get mixed up in a confusing situation involving rival gangs, the police and two briefcases. Also involved is a new gang of gypsies, as well as Norman (Pawel Wilczak) and sexy killer Maja (Malgorzata Socha). However the commissioner of police (Jan Frycz) and wet-behind-the-ears Sergeant Malinowski are aiming to spoil the gangsters 'plans. Inspired by action classics like 'The Matrix' and Quentin Tarantino favourites such as 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Kill Bill', the film features a top-notch Polish cast and Cezary Pazura, making his debut as director, stamps his trademark humour on every scene. The crew of this big-budget Polish comedy included specialists who worked on the likes of 'Casino Royale'.",
