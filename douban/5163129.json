    "introduction": "Everyone knows it or thinks that they know it - but they really do not: the classic film The Battleship Potemkin (1925) by Sergei Eisenstein. Shortly after its completion, the film and original negatives were sold to Germany in 1926 and mutilated by censorship authorities. The film was then sent back to the Soviet Union and revised several times.On the Trail of Battleship Potemkin presents the different versions, the German restoration from 2005, and statements from head restorer Enno Patalas, Eisenstein expert Naum Kleiman, and Helmut Imig, who adapted the original Edmund Meisel score. A fascinating, film historical detective story.",
