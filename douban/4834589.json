    "introduction": "仰望星空，多么美好的一个词。140亿年前，天地混沌。大爆炸产生万物，我们的宇宙诞生了。科学界就是这么解释，宇宙诞生那一刻的。然而新一代的宇宙学家们开始质疑，关于宇宙的起源，关于我们对宇宙的一些基本了解，是不是真的正确。本片从宇宙学标准模型讲起，从暴胀理论，到暗物质及寻找暗物质的研究，到暗能量，及暗流的理论。最后会得出怎样的结论呢？There's something very odd going on in space - something that shouldn't be possible. It is as though vast swathes of the universe are being hoovered up by a vast and unseen celestial vacuum cleaner.Sasha Kaslinsky, the scientist who discovered the phenomenon, is understandably nervous: 'It left us quite unsettled and jittery' he says, 'because this is not something we planned to find'. The accidental discovery of what is ominously being called 'dark flow' not only has implications for the destinies of large numbers of galaxies - it also means that large numbers of scientists might have to find a new way of understanding the universe.Dark flow is the latest in a long line of phenomena that have threatened to re-write the textbooks. Does it herald a new era of understanding, or does it simply mean that everything we know about the universe is wrong?",
