    "introduction": "The factory that once employed an entire town and its surrounding villages has closed down due to a questionable privatization process, coinciding with a tragic incident where a group of its workers perished in a premeditated fire. Devastated by the loss of their loved ones and the subsequent corrupt sale of the factory, the remaining workers initiate protests, but their efforts seem futile, yielding no concrete results. Feeling abandoned not only by the authorities but also by their cherished church, they find themselves seeking solace and answers in the supernatural.",
