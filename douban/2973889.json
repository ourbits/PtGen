    "introduction": "Overweight highschool student, Miguel, attempts to lose ten pounds in order to spice up his social life. However, name calling classmates are the least of his worries when the sinister celebrity Richard Simmons casts his evil gaze over Miguels large appetite. Through a strange twist of events, Miquel finds himself teamed with sleezy Silly Wanka in a bout to prevent world domination, and to lose a couple of pounds on the side.So how funny could a movie be about someone trying to lose weight? At first I was skeptical but soon became pleasantly surprised. I Need To Lose Ten Pounds weaves class slapstick and witty humour to create a blanket of laugh out loud fun that'll leave you singing it's brilliantly written musical numbers all the way home.",
