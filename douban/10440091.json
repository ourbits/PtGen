    "introduction": "Hudda is a Mumbai-based gangster who undertakes to kill people with the help of a male simply known as the Professor, who is in the habit of buying lottery tickets. Both the Professor and Hudda will find their lives changing when the nephew of a gangster gets killed, and they must find an undertaker who is able to put his mutilated face together. They do find one in A. Salvi, who reluctantly undertakes to do this job for a large fee. Then the Professor, who borrows books on 'Sex' from the Central Library, will be thrilled when he finds out that he is the winner of a Rs.2 Crore lottery. Before he could even claim the prize, he will find his car has been stolen, and the lottery ticket, which he had inserted in one of the 'Sex' books, is missing. Amidst hilarious chaos and encounters with assorted characters, the Professor attempts to first locate his car and then the missing lottery ticket. Written by rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)",
