    "introduction": "Buckingham Palace is Britain’s most iconic home, with 775 rooms and estimated to be worth in excess of £2 billion. But turn back the clock and it looked nothing like the imposing property we glimpse through the gates today.The series offers a sweeping narrative of the stately home, from the exclusive balls thrown by its first royal owners, King George III and his beloved wife Queen Charlotte, through Queen Victoria’s mighty reign, Nazi bombing during World War II and beyond. Along the way, gossip, scandal and fights within the royal household are revealed.Episodes are packed with incredible facts, including the palace’s own ATM machine dispensing cash just for the royals and the exotic animals once kept in the palace garden – including England’s first zebra. The series makes use of an ever-changing CGI floorplan, showing how the iconic building has been transformed across the centuries as a long line of monarchs have each made their mark.S1 E1 The Early YearsS1 E2 Keeping CleanS1 E3 Victoria's EraS1 E4 Then There Was LightS1 E5 Surviving WarS1 E6 Into the Future",
