    "introduction": "A backstage look at one of classical music's best-known yet least understood figures. Ozawa has beenmusic director of the Boston Symphony since 1973,and as one of the world's top maestros he appears insuch musical capitals as Berlin, Paris and Milan. Yet thefirst East Asian to succeed in a quintessentially Westernart form remains solidly Japanese in temperament andoutlook. It is this contrast of cultures-and its effect onhis music making-that makes him such a provocative figure.Ozawa studied conducting with Hideo Saito, who had beena pupil of Cellist Emanuel Feuermann in Germany. He saidthat if you know music and have no tradition, then you mustgo to Europe, remembers Ozawa. Today Ozawa uneasilystraddles both worlds. The exemplar of success in classicalmusic, in Japan he is a role model to thousands of youngperformers. In the West, old questions about how deeply heunderstands music continue to dog him.Given the continuing influx of Asian performers, Ozawa'sperspective is one worth heeding. Western music is likethe sun, he says. All over the word, the sunset is different,but the beauty is the same. Maybe there is a way to makea marriage between this Oriental blood and Western music.",
