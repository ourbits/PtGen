    "introduction": "I found this film interesting because it documents very thoroughly the events of the 1974 war in Cyprus(and the occurrences leading up to it) in a very interesting light. It is very informative, though it be one-sided in its' information that it chooses to provide. However, its' side is represented well with the presentation of many facts and touching cinematic sequences, and shows a completeness in its' study and documentation of the war. It presents the reality of the situation and the problems that were faced by the people in Cyprus on a very human level, and it is the sort of film that you cannot easily forget.Overall, if you enjoy historical or political films, and have any remote interest in the Mediterranean political situation, I would recommend it. Otherwise, one might not find the film to be particularly interesting or good, in spite of the beautiful shots of Cyprus and touching stories told by those caught in the tragedy.",
