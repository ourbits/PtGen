    "introduction": "Raf lives in a basement apartment in Vancouver; she is eccentric and broke, she lets herself be carried passively along on the flow of life. Then she meets Tal: not only is she rich, she is also energetic and stubborn and life seems to have her solidly in hand. Written and directed by the debut filmmaker Harry Cepka, it eccentrically re-elaborates the canons of weird indie, with originality and innovative energy. The protagonist Grace Glowicki is like a combination of the actress Greta Gerwig, Buster Keaton, and Denis Lavant.",
