    "introduction": "In September 2018, nearly all of America was transfixed by Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, alleging then-Supreme-Court-nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her in the summer of 1982. While many Americans remember Ford’s allegations, not as many know about Deborah Ramirez, who came forward during the nomination process with her own story of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh during their time as Yale classmates.Like many Americans disturbed by these stories and the way they were treated by government officials supposedly driven by the search for the truth, director Doug Liman enlisted producer Amy Herdy for his first documentary feature that pursues the depth and strength of the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh and the equally telling and dishonest responses to ensure his installation on the Court. With harrowing accounts, disturbing revelations, and shockingly direct lies from a man who now sits with a lifetime term on the highest court in the land, Justice is a portrait of a broken, corrupt system and the brave citizens who still feel duty-bound to tell their story.源自：https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/63c7eec450ad19449f09b1be",
