This documentary tells the story of their unique aesthetic worlds and art journeys through their daily lives and their relationship with the city by bringing together these worldwide known four prominent names of Turkish modern art. They create artworks in their ateliers based in Istanbul, a city that gathers the past, future, chaos, culture, city, and a variety of art disciplines. These artworks extend from the enchanting streets of Istanbul to the famous international art galleries and museums.
