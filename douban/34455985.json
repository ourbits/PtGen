    "introduction": "Caco, João, Mava and Rebecca follows 4 teenagers improvising with dance and movement. The camera follows each of them in long continuous shots, observing an intimate process of play and research into the body’s possible movements. The subjectivity of each dancer is made palpable through the closeness of their breathing, emphasized by the contrasting sounds of the outside world and the other dancers off-screen. As in the first part of this trilogy, Bella, Maia and Nick (2018), the film avoids building up tension and deviates from working towards an aim. Instead it explores the timespan between the already and the not yet, the time of potentiality.",
