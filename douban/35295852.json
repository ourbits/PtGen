    "introduction": "\"The Red Orchestra\" was the most important resistance group inside the Third Reich, a vast spy network mainly located in Brussels and Paris during the Second World War. Those activists help the Jews persecuted by the regime, hide deserters and gather military information that will be decisive for the victory of the allies. By comparing the images and the narrative of a film made in the German Federal Republic (GFR) and a series made in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in the early 1970s, each of the two films only telling half the truth, but also by meeting the descendants of these courageous men, shootings on the important places of this history and by inviting some specialists of that time, the director Carl-Ludwig Rettinger proposes to shed light on this network of mythical spy.",
