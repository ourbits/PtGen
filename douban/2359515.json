    "introduction": "A stellar cast headed by Ian McDiarmid and Iain Glen brings to life the story of the very first 'cops', the Fielding brothers, in City of Vice, a major new historical drama series set in the vice-ridden world of Georgian London.Informed by primary source material, the six-part series is set in 18th Century Covent Garden - the centre of London's vice trade. It follows the fortunes of Henry and John Fielding - brothers, magistrates of London and the men who created the modern police force.Henry Fielding (the man we know as the father of the English novel) and John Fielding (his half-blind brother) are London's first real 'cops' - investigating the lives and crimes of prostitutes, pimps, gamblers and villains (all meticulously researched real characters) who operate in a world where the rules of policing have not yet been invented. Making up the 'procedure' as they go along, the Fieldings invent many of the standard systems of policing today including taking witness statements and creating an organised system of informants.Following the evolution of the capital's police force, City of Vice exposes the steamier side of life in 18th Century London. Also featuring Geraldine James, Nigel Harman, Juliet Aubrey and Frances Magee. City of Vice is directed by Justin Hardy (Trafalgar Battle Surgeon, The Relief of Belsen) and Dan Reed (Lewis, 9/11 Liars); co-created and exec produced by Rob Pursey (The Vice, The Queen's Sister); written by Clive Bradley and Peter Harness; and produced by Lachlan MacKinnon.",
