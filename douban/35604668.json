    "introduction": "The first instalment of Phyllida Lloyd’s groundbreaking all-female Shakespeare Trilogy sees Dame Harriet Walter take on the role of Brutus, who wrestles with his moral conscience over the murder of Julius Caesar. The Donmar Shakespeare Trilogy began in 2012 with this diverse interpretation of Julius Caesar and was followed by Henry IV in 2014 and The Tempest in 2016. Set in the world of a women’s prison, these critically acclaimed productions were captured live at Donmar Kings Cross and co-produced by the Donmar Warehouse and Illuminations. Julius Caesar was selected for the Edinburgh International Film Festival 2017 and nominated for the Michael Powell Award for Best British Feature Film.",
