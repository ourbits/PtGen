    "introduction": "On a hot summer day, a man wearing a sweater coughs as he walks. He enters an underground, gruesome restaurant and orders fried rice. The restaurant owner swears to customers who leave food on their plate unfinished and he struggles to finish everything on his plate. The film takes advantage of the short film form and accentuates its merits, taking the story through a dramatic flow in a simple situation with various characters. (Hong Hyosook)",
