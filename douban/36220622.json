    "introduction": "In the early 1960s, Ringo Starr, well known for his easygoing personality, became a legend as a member of The Beatles. Starr, primarily a drummer, also sang and occasionally wrote songs for the group, including \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" and \"Octopus's Garden.\" In part, Starr's playing shaped rock n' roll for decades to come, as he kept the beat with his sharp, aggressive style behind the kit. As a result of the goodwill and fortune he earned as a Beatle, he was loved around the world and welcomed wherever he went. Even though he was the guy who could sing \"Yellow Submarine\" and get blisters on his fingers during \"Helter Skelter,\" his success and status didn't protect him from the unseemly, upsetting, and depressing side of life. Although Starr has had more than his fair share of darkness and bad luck, he has been an honourable person through his contributions to music and charities.",
