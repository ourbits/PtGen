It's registered as one of the world's natural inheritances and it is also where director Hayao Miyazaki's animation \"Princess Mononoke\" takes place. A young lady called Rina Takagi comes along with him to this ten days trip. The two pass through lakes and forests, opening up slowly towards each other. They decide to meet 'Jomonsgi', a Japanese cedar tree aged 7200 years...who is this mysterious old man worth 7200 years?",
