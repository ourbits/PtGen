    "introduction": "House. Sauna. Ladder. Park. The little comforts of life. Take an uplifting 3D stroll with architect Emil!Surprising experimentalist Arko Okk cleverly uses an original dual-lens 3D camera to visually explore journeys through space, motivating charismatic workaholic Emil Urbel to bring the importance of environmental architecture to a wider audience.Urbel is a humble yet noble man whose magical touch is sought after by wealthier clients. While developing public buildings and schools in the city, he strives to invent and design simple, functional and intelligent houses, steering clear of the excess that characterises the infamous big white box villas.As a teacher and self-made architect, Urbel inspires others to imagine a city designed for pleasant living, highlighting the beauty of urban quality. He leads impromptu, detailed tours of Tallinn, sharing his insights with a sharp sense of humour.",
