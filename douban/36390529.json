    "introduction": "Samantha was left to carry the guilt and shame from an act that was out of her control. When she couldn’t find the words to speak, she reeled from the results of her choices — or lack thereof. Paralyzed by her trauma, Samantha spins at the thought of how to proceed. How does she move forward with this burden? And how big of a burden will it be? She is in agony as she tries to understand if speaking up would have made a difference, or if her voice was never meant to be HEARD.",
