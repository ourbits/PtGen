    "introduction": "In his debut special, acclaimed comedian Sal Vulcano vividly recalls the fears he had throughout his adolescent life and how they simply have lingered much too long into adulthood. The special offers a charming perspective of Vulcano's hysterical real-life experiences with the lies about thunder, surprisingly menacing 80s song lyrics, and the war against moths that never quite happened. With animated storytelling and clever punchlines, this special showcases Vulcano's unique style and reinforces why he is a mainstay in the world of comedy.",
