    "introduction": "The Royal Ballet presents Wayne McGregor's triptych, inspired by the writings of Virginia Woolf, with an original score by Max Richter. Met with outstanding critical acclaim on its premiere in 2015, it went on to win McGregor the Critics' Circle Award for Best Classical Choreography and the Olivier Award for Best New Dance Production. Each of the three acts draws from one of Woolf's iconic novels - Mrs Dalloway, Orlando and The Waves - combined with elements from her letters, essays and diaries. Presented from The Royal Opera House by Darcey Bussell and Clemency Burton-Hill.",
