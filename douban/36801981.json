    "introduction": "Transnistria is a thin strip of land between the Moldovan river Dniestr and the Ukrainian border. Since 1992 Transnistria has claimed and defended its independency, keeping all relevant artifacts of autonomous statehood: parliament, government, military, police and currency. In this compelling documentary we meet Oxana, a naïve and obedient school teacher, and Victor, tombstone dealer and regime opponent.",
