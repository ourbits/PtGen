    "introduction": "A colorful group of characters clash over a crooked gambling game when they meet head to head in old Edo during the samurai era in Japan. From a carnival atmosphere with a few touches of humor to a powerful swordfight drama, this is an exciting and highly enter-taining film. Great performances and an excellent cast which includes the soon to be famous \"Tora-san\" actor Atsumi Kyoshi in a rare jidai geki appearance. (TV Broadcast quality) ~ KurotokagiGood Rascals is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, whether in Japanese, English or whatever language. Forget about historical accuracy or artistic refinement. This is just pure entertainment. With its four comic leads, a convoluted farcical plot and even a song and dance interlude, this is very much the jidai-geki equivalent of a Marx Brothers comedy.",
