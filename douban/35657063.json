    "introduction": "Bruno is a plastic artist who, after suffering a very traumatic experience, abandons his art to begin a new life. He finds refuge with his only friend Roberto, who offers him a job and a place to stay at a chop shop, where he must look after his property, assisted by a gun and a flashlight. He spends his time divided between work and diversion. But on one night, as he is roaming around the damaged cars, he has a revelation. Absences and presences will coexist inside Bruno's mind. The scrap yard is a place of both horror and pleasure. Roberto will notice a change in his friend's mental state, who rejects the idea of leaving the premises. Lost in a labyrinth of junk and memory, Bruno will go to great extremes to enter the world of the dead.",
