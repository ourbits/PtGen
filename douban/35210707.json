The authoritarian government responds by signing an executive order sending all black citizens to Africa as an excuse to repay the debts of slavery. Citizens are measured by their skin color, hunted, and exiled to Africa against their will. While the army and police enforce the law, he enlists his uncle to find his wife, a doctor who has gone missing and joins an underground movement. The three of them fight the madness that has taken over the country and spark a resistance that inspires the nation.",
