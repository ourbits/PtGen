    "introduction": "Can a person be recreated alone based on their search history? Five years of a woman's life have been excavated to create a composite portrait, subsequently played by an actress. The original is then presented to its double. Part experiment, part cross-media project, part documentary, Made to Measure is a dizzying project about the surrender of our private lives, directed by the filmmakers behind The Cleaners (FIFDH 2018).",
