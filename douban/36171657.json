    "introduction": "A short animation made in the cut-out technique. The film tells the story of a dream that allows you to break free from life in captivity. A surreal journey into the mind of the main character is a utopian vision of a world in which all organisms are interconnected. Inspired by the Gaia Hypothesis, the film combines original visuals with music and sound created by jazz musicians Olo Walicki and Jacek Prościński.",
