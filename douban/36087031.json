    "introduction": "Dispel the myths, meet the legends and witness the rise and fall of the greatest warriors in history…An unstoppable force for more than 300 years saw the relentless and far-reaching growth of the Viking Empire.Throughout history, Vikings waged war from the seas, notoriously ruthless and with their own set of rules. The Viking expansion was unprecedented in the veracity of its spread. Known for merciless bloodshed, the Norsemen became the most feared people in history. However, their story has always been told from a one-sided, Christian point of view and only now, after rigorous research through mythical sagas and bioarchaeological finds, can we uncover the truth about who the Vikings really were.EPISODE 1: THE ROAD TO LINDISFARNEEPISODE 2: THE GREAT HEATHEN ARMYEPISODE 3: AS FAR EAST AS BAGHDADEPISODE 4: THE FALL OF FRANCIAEPISODE 5: THE WILD WESTEPISODE 6: THE SECOND VIKING AGE",
