    "introduction": "The Legend of Leigh Bowery is an exploration of Bowery's outrageous life -- a life as performance! Bowery was a costume designer, nightclub impresario, playwright, performer and musician. Bowery was associated with film director John Maybury (Love is the Devil), painter Lucien Freud, the band \"Massive Attack\", portrayed 'Madame Garbo' in The Homosexual (or The Difficulty of Sexpressing Oneself) -- he died of AIDS-related causes in 1994. As part of a revival of interest in Bowery, in January 2002 'Taboo', a musical by Boy George about the 1980s London club scene, opens and includes Leigh Bowery amongst its characters and this film is released in the same year.",
