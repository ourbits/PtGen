Hannah is used to running the interior her way, but suddenly finds herself at odds with a seasoned new leader - Captain Sandy. Bobby is once again looking for love while also working in close quarters with his ex. Chef Adam brings a chilled-out surfer vibe to the galley, as deckhand Malia finds herself the center of attention with the guys. When Captain Sandy interferes with a picnic, Hannah is left wondering if she will make it through the season.",
