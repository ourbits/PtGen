    "introduction": "A comedy mockumentary about the fundamentalists who want to ban roleplaying games and their epic quest -- to create the ultimate anti-D&D movie.Christian filmmaker Harmony Hope Bryant has a dream -- of a world where roleplaying games like Dungeons & Dragons are revealed to everyone as the tools of Satan -- and she'll stop at nothing to fulfill it.Determined to spread her message about the evils of RPGs, she recruits her husband, mild-manned wedding planner Brady Bryant, to help her produce the ultimate expose: a film about innocent girls who are sucked into a pit of sin and despair when their role-playing game turns all too real.This behind-the-scenes mockumentary, in the style of This Is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman, follows the misadventures of the Bryants as their movie turns into a production from hell: filmmakers who will do anything to get the shot, churchgoers who will stop at nothing to save souls, and gamers who will fight tooth and nail to defend their hobby.From the masterminds behind The Gamers, JourneyQuest, and Dark Dungeons.",
