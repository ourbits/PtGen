She is unaware that her wealthy, aging and gout-ridden employer, Phillip Nobrains, has left her everything in his will. Nobrains' crooked butler, Reginald Scuttle, does learn about the will. To get Nobrains' money, Scuttle plans on getting rid of both Nobrains and the girl's husband so that he can enter into what only he would know is a fake marriage with her, she who would become an heiress. To get rid of Nobrains, Scuttle misinforms him of the fact that some submarine pirates will be targeting his upcoming cruise vacation. For the husband, Scuttle manages to get him a job as a cabin boy on the cruise. Scuttle's scheme goes according to plan, until... which leads to mayhem for all concerned.",
