    "introduction": "The title of Miguel Gomes' début film is derived from the expression: 'Until the age of thirty, you have the face that God gave you, after that you have the face you deserve.' Himself having just reached thirty, Gomes embroiders forth on this theme and works it into an idiosyncratic, humorous and fascinating film; the universe with a logic all of its own. Because what about the protagonist Francisco? It's his birthday and he's turning thirty. He's not very happy, wearing his cowboy suit at a school party, surrounded by children that irritate him. But not wanting to grow older is no reason to be as annoying as Francisco... Then the action moves to a fantasy world where seven strange little men live. It's the space where Francisco tries to wrestle himself free from his childishness. Gomes: 'The seven characters are like Snow White's seven dwarfs. But they are also seven childish sides of Francisco's character. He shall have to settle up with them one by one to grow up.' The Face You Deserve is beautifully and attractively made in all respects, from the casting and soundtrack to the setting where Francisco's sublimated catharsis from being a child takes place. The result is an intriguing fairy-tale about the end of an endless childhood.",
