    "introduction": "少年派迪卡是柬埔寨和喀麥隆的混血兒。1992年赤柬垮台後，柬埔寨迎來第一次民主選舉，聯合國組成多國聯合政府進駐柬埔寨，派迪卡是此波戰後嬰兒潮縮影代表。母親離家多年，來自喀麥隆的父親只是一張相片的存在，格格不入的外表使他在孤兒院備受歧視，無處可歸。派迪卡試著尋找自己的父母，等待他的卻是殘酷荒謬的現實人生，世界如此寬廣，下一步往哪裡去...? 柬埔寨新銳導演Neang Kavich首部紀錄作品，以簡潔而充滿張力的紀實影像，透過少年純真的眼光與際遇，窺見柬埔寨戰後內在的暴力與矛盾。The story of San Pattica, a high school age student who was born to a Cameroonian father and Cambodian mother, and his struggles with his mixed race identity. His mother left him to be raised by his grandmother; his father left Cambodia after finishing his term as a United Nations Peacekeeper in the early 1990s. Eventually Pattica winds up being sent to an orphanage. Pattica discovers that he has a half-sister, Pattina, the daughter of his mother and a man from Ghana. Being half-black and half Cambodian, Pattica and Pattina grapple with the racism they encounter. Meanwhile, Pattica tries to track down his father.★2013 阿姆斯特丹國際紀錄片影展",
