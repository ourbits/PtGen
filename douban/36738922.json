    "introduction": "Mo is a hopeful Arab actor in his struggle-filled youth, residing in London with his wife Dounya. Dounya believes Mo should pursue stable work rather than taping for leading acting roles, unattainable for actors of color. Unexpectedly, Mo's agent Steven rings, offering a sudden audition that carries life-altering potential. During his journey to the audition, a misunderstanding arises when a biased woman onboard misconstrues Mo's actions as prayer and suspects a forgotten bag. In a swift turn, Mo's world descends into a Kafkaesque nightmare of terror.",
