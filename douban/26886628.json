    "introduction": "The year is 1991. Simon and his best friend Frede are very busy doing absolutely nothing in a tiny suburban town outside Copenhagen. Simon has always loved to draw but has never quite had an outlet for his talent. He experiences a jolting realization when he learns about the graffiti culture by chance, and now he sees a chance to accomplish something that will leave a mark on the world. Simon and Frede quickly paint graffiti all over the town they live in, and when CHAOS, a large graffiti crew from Copenhagen, discovers Simon's talent, they recruit the both of them. As opposed to Frede, Simon is completely hooked by the environment, but he soon realizes that things are not quite what he thought they would be. CHAOS is lead by Johan, and he dictates his crew's every move - without having any artistic talent of his own. When Johan talks Simon into painting over an entire train, Simon faces a challenge that may cost him his future as well as his friendship with Frede.",
