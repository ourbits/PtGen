    "introduction": "Only one person filmed the shooting of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. Abraham Zapruder’s home movie would be used by anyone with a theory about who shot JFK - from those who blamed a lone gunman to those who believed in a high-level conspiracy.On the 60th anniversary, this documentary hears the actual voices of those who were there: witnesses, police outriders, bodyguards and surgeons. And for the first time, bringing together his exclusive words and pictures, Abraham Zapruder reveals what really happened.A rare audio recoding by Zapruder tells of how he nearly missed filming the event completely, but then managed to find a vantage point that gave him an unobstructed view to record the most famous home movie in history.Combining Abraham Zapruder’s 26 second film with his own narration, this is a unique insight into the moment the world changed forever.Producer: Shearwater Media",
