    "introduction": "When author George Boulangé agrees to the wishes of his wife, Isabelle, and brings a young and beautiful waitress (Cecile) from café along for their weekend sailing trip, it becomes clear that he has agreed to do this for his own desires to stir up trouble, develop a plot for his novel, and ultimately discard Isabelle and replace her with Cecile. Isabelle is forced to confront the fact that she is aging out of what George wants in a playmate and spouse, and knows that the only way to hold onto her relationship is to become the alpha in the relationship. But George fights back, forcing them into a game of one-oneupmanship. Eventually the trio - Isabelle, Cecile and the ship's Captain - join forces against George, making their position clear. In the morning, he is reported missing, and Detective Kenny Park must sort through everyone's stories to ascertain if there was foul play, or if George simply left for greener pastures.",
