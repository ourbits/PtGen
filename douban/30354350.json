    "introduction": "A drama dealing with the complex relationships of men and women who work together under the pressure of always having to be ready for the worst. There is always a new emergency for them to handle, while at the same time dealing with their own personal crises, ambitions and desires. They are as likely to spend a day fishing body parts from a car wreck as they are carrying a victim to safety. Under these heated circumstances, relationships can become so intense that when they go wrong, they can go awfully wrong. Every episode brings a new disaster for them to clean up and new beats in the characters' own personal stories.",
