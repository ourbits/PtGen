The kidnapping goes as planned, but then they discover that the person they have kidnapped is not a businessman but a powerful and deadly organized crime figure named Musabhai. Musabhai would be more than happy to get rid of the four for their nerve but discovers that by kidnapping him, they unintentionally thwarted a mob hit on his life which was to take place sometime later. In exchange for sparing their life, Musa recruits the four youngsters to help him in striking back at his longtime rival Sultan.",
