    "introduction": "A feature-length verité-driven documentary film that follows two visionary social justice leaders, Marc Morial (National Urban League) and Janet Murguía (UnidosUS), as they empower their diverse African American and Latinx American communities to dismantle our country’s legacy of structural racism. Directed by two-time Academy Award-winning filmmaker Barbara Kopple, the film begins in 2018 as the country is in the grip of the Trump administration and a troubling resurgence of White Supremacy, and follows the stunning arc of the racial justice movement and the global pandemic over the ensuing years.源自：https://www.filmfestival.gr/en/section-tiff/movie/1272/14826",
