    "introduction": "A lovable, anachronistic road moo-vieh: Flora, an irresistibly quirky young lady, sets off on a long journey to her new job as a librarian. Before long her train fare gets stolen and she has to hitchhike for the first time in her life. Tim, a softhearted, simple plumber traveling with his cow Hannah, stops his pink truck and picks her up. Tim's scheduled arrival quickly starts to evaporate when Flora not only loses Hannah, but also picks up 14-year old runaway Jo. Flora catapults her incompatible companions on a journey full of strange surprises and awkward love. The cow is the only one to remain unchanged by the events. But cows don't need to change - they're fine to start with",
