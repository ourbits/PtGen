    "introduction": "Veteran photojournalist Anne Marie Kerr suspects that her brother Alan's death in a remote town was not the accident it appeared to be, and decides to find out what really happened. Assuming a false identity, she goes to work for the wealt** and powerful Hollister family who control the town, and may have had a hand in Alan's death. The oldest son, Jason Hollister is dangerously handsome, with a violent temper and, as Anne Marie learns, has a good reason for wanting her brother dead. As she navigates the treacherous waters of the Hollister's family past, Anne Marie finds herself falling in love with the man who may have killed her brother. Or is he simply covering up for his weaker brother, Brent, whose beautiful wife Simone was rumored to have had a lover. The answer lies hidden somewhere in the breathtakingly beautiful but dangerous gorge where Alan met his death. In the lightening paced climax, Anne Marie learns that she was right to trust her heart.",
