    "introduction": "\"Wszyscy święci / All Saints\" (TV film from the series \"Święta polskie\" / \"Polish Holidays\" based on a screenplay by Grzegorz Łoszewski)The holiday commemorating the dead becomes a pretext for reflections on Poland's past, political divisions, difficult ethical evaluations of people's attitudes which do not always allow for a black/white perception. A film series made by many directors. Taking on a ready-made framework and someone else's script, Barański failed to find his own language in this film (Award: 2002 - award of the National Radio and Television Council for best television film).",
