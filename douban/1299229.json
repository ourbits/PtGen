    "introduction": "说实话这书我就没怎么看懂，电影比书倒是好理解一些，可加了不少巴利个人的风格在内，他本人就是拉美新电影运动的创始者，在这片里还亲自出演主角，影片最让我喜欢的是原声的确做得很不错，得到威尼斯配乐金奖名副其实。4/5An elderly man with wings is blown off course during a tropical storm in this symbolic fantasy. The Old Man (Fernando Birri) lands near a Caribbean island where a poor family gives him shelter in a chicken coop. Father Gonzaga (Luis Alberto Ramirez) is the skeptical priest who rushes to damn the creature. Soon the Old Man is the subject of curiosity seekers as Elisinda (Daisy Granados) and Pelayo (Asdrubal Melendez) start charging admission. A traveling carnival of human oddities camps near the Old Man as people flock to see the show. The Old Man is reduced to being an unwanted pet, and after six years, he mends his wings and flies away. Nudity, simulated sex with a spider woman, and the ugliness of human exploitation definitely put this fantasy in a category not for children. ~ Dan Pavlides, All Movie GuideWhat would you do if you found a sick, decrepit angel in your backyard? \"A Very Old Man With Enormous Wings\" comments on faith and doubt as it explores the arrival of a winged old man who washes ashore into the lives of Pelayo and Elisenda. They put him first into a chicken coop(because of his wings), then on display and charge admission for the townspeople to see him. A doubting priest provides comic relief and pokes fun at the not easily convinced Catholic Church. The soundtrack is excellent. All fans of Garcia Marquez must not go another minute without seeing this movie.",
