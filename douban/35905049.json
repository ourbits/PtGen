    "introduction": "Set in a near future where the climate crisis is solved, everything is green and sustainable and everyone now live with their own personal robot assistants. Here, the lonely 12-yearold Alberte is given the perfect birthday present: the newest model of humanoids on the market; Konrad, who looks and acts completely as if he were human. Far better than her old teddybear-like robot, Robbi, who is quite an embarrassment to her at school. Alberte’s popularity spikes as she is now the kid with the most advanced technology in school. She also seems to be forming a genuine connection with Konrad - but is it even possible to befriend a robot?源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/my-robot-brother/",
