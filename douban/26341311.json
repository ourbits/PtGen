    "introduction": "Rebekka's beloved younger sister has just committed suicide. Grieving, angry and seeking justice, with nothing but a kitchen knife in hand, she drives off to a tranquil waterfront hotel deep in the fjords of Western Norway. The very hotel, where of her sister's assailant currently resides. Murder on her mind, she arrives under a false identity, a journalist for a travel magazine. She receives a hearty welcome from the man and his wife. Shortly into her stay, she corners the man alone, and has her chance to kill him, but her courage fails her. Changing strategy, she decides that stripping him from everything that matters; his family, and most importantly his social status is an even greater punishment. Weaving her plan slowly, like a lone cowboy she rides into town seeking her kind of justice, and when she rides back out, left behind is a destroyed man and a village in chaos and justice in her heart.
