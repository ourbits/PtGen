    "introduction": "It has been called 'the saddest acre in America.' It is also one of the most sacred. Section 60 in Arlington National Cemetery is the final resting place for young men and women who died fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. For families and friends, it is a place to grieve, to honor, to remember--and to find comfort and community with others who have shared the same profound loss. Award-winning filmmakers Jon Alpert and Matthew O'Neill present this emotional, elegiac documentary filmed entirely in Section 60 where cameras captured the sights and sounds of funerals and provide intimate glimpses of family members and friends who have come to honor their loved ones.",
