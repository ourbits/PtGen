    "introduction": "Angeli Bianchi… Angeli Neri comes from director Luigi Scattini, who started his career as a journalist before directing movies like Primitive Love with Jayne Mansfield and War Italian Style with Buster Keaton.One of the best things about this mondo film — a genre that is pretty much reality TV before that was a thing or the kind of shows that most folks love on cable today — is the collaboration between composer Piero Umiliani and director Luigi Scattini.As the film was shot mostly in Brazil — where else would you go to show off the world of black magic, devil-worshipping and pagan rituals — the soundtrack was partly recorded there with the help of local musicians and instruments before being finished in RomeThe score is a psychedelic treat, combining modern and ambient tones of 1969 with bossa nova and samba. That’s kind of perfect for this X rated exploration of the occult circa 1969.English language version",
