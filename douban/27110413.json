    "introduction": "A young dancer trying to make it in London during World War II discovers that people like her singing voice, too. Although she's at first reluctant to sing, she finally does and becomes a star. She hooks up with a young musician who composes classical music and turns his nose up at this vulgar \"popular\" music, but she believes he can be a success at it and sets out to turn him around.
