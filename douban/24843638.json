    "introduction": "A beautifully staged \"impressionistic\" documentary on the extraordinary Wojciech Has. Has appears almost as a ghost (he died two years after this was made); a silent presence, but one whose influence is felt throughout.Making appearances are many of Has's favourite actors, including Jan Nowicki and Gustaw Holoubek, reliving their shared experiences in a film that serves as a profoundly moving and nostalgic tribute to one of the greatest Polish filmmakers (indeed, one of the greatest filmmakers).",
