    "introduction": "The story is based on the life of Kimo and Ben. Both gay. Both Mormon. A special and loving relationship spanning three decades, only to be shattered by cancer, HOWARD defies condemnation from family, church, and community, when tolerance and acceptance of relationships outside the perceived \"norm\" were rare. This couple's long-term journey would prove that love, at its highest level, can overcome obstacles and make a positive impact on others, starting with living their truth without compromising their own faith and family that shunned them. In a world of dysfunctional relationships and forced \"happiness,\" this story truly provides hope and inspiration. Moreover, at its core, HOWARD changes the hearts and minds of those touched by it.",
