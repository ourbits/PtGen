    "introduction": "Shot over a ten-year period, Diary is not only the political, professional and personal diary of a man, but a testemony that is also a statement on the turbulent reality of a war-torn country, Israel. The six chapters that make up the film take us from Tel Aviv to Paris, then to London and Brazil, where David Perlov was born, and where he decides to return after a twenty-year absence. The film is also a family diary in which Perlov records the coming of age of his two daughters, Yael and Naomi. There are meetings with Claude Lanzman, Isaac Stern, Joris Ivens, Andre Schwartz-Bart, Irving Howe,and Klaus Kinsky. An extraordinary mixture of home movies, political documentary and cinema-verité, Diary is a unique work. The ten years of shooting and five more of editing have resulted in a film which has the spontaneity and apparent arbitrariness of a snapshotbut which is a carefully composed and graded as a finished masterpiece.",
