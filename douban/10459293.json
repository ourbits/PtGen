    "introduction": "Film based on meetings with anonymous Predator drone pilots from the US military, operating the un-manned flights over Afghanistan and Pakistan.A drone operator discusses his daily routine. Off camera and off the record, he describes recurring incidents in which the unmanned plane fired at both militants and civilians - and the psychological difficulties he experienced as a result. Director Fast mixes fact and fiction, merging documentary shots of war zones with happy Las Vegas feature-film images. He erases reality by inventing his own, which is nonetheless true.",
