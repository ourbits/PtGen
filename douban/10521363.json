    "introduction": "\"Even more enchanting - as it is more meditative and melancholic, even funnier - than ZUR SACHE, SCHÄTZCHEN. Within the company of shopping mall arsonists and sausage thiefs, Werner Enke sums up the condition of the modern man with conclusively timeless words: \"The old verve has gone down the drain.\"However, May Spils presents her male star in a way no male German filmmaker has hardly ever accomplished for his female lead... truly easygoing. Such is his nonchalance that his high jump into a field of wheat, effortlessly catapults him over the cinematic edges of Schwabing*, right up into the highest spheres of physical screen elegance.\"",
