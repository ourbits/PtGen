    "introduction": "English satellites who conduct research from space discover large oil deposits in the area of the old mines in Cyprus. A big part of the area belongs to Costantas Rizites (he has bought half of it from his Turkish Cypriot colleague Ahmet Beyoglu) who has retired there with his wife Ellou. The outbreak of a big economic crisis leads the two sons of the family to bankruptcy forcing them to move their families to the house. This whole situation is made worse when the Cyprus government keeps asking to buy the house, and Costantas stubbornly refuses. Moreover, two English agents and Hasan Beyoglu (son of Ahmet) camp outside the house. The house is in a state of internal and external siege.",
