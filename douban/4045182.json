    "introduction": "画家瓦尔杜在画一幅不知名的女人肖像。可没想到的是，画中的女人竟然“活了”并出现在了画展的开幕式上，他的生活发生了翻天覆地的变化。瓦尔杜疯狂地爱上了这个神秘的女人，但他并没有想到自己已经陷入了一个名为ZOM的灵学组织的陷阱。瓦尔杜发现他不能再相信任何人甚至于自己的理智。但是，这个单纯的画家也不是一个轻易能被袭击的目标。A painter named Vlado paints a portrait of an unknown woman. When the portrait “becomes alive” and the woman IN the painting shows up at the artist's exhibition opening, Vlado's life is turned upside down. As Vlado becomes involved in a passionate affair with the mysterious woman, he does not even notice that he has fallen into the trap of Zom, a parapsychological organization which controls the actions of individuals by entering their thoughts, which is the meaning of “passing”. A whirlwind of curious events and unexplained suicides takes him into a world where reality and fantasy are intertwined, a world created by a manipulative international corporation. In the world where relationships are just a means to an end and death is only an illusion, control and power are of ultimate value. Vlado realizes that he cannot trust anyone and even doubts his own sanity. However, it turns out that the naïve artist is not such an easy target.",
