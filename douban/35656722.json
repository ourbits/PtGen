    "introduction": "The new film by César González follows a maintenance employee at a printing house whose routine, almost as automatic as the movements of the company machines, is altered when she makes a decision that threatens both her job and her everyday life in the neighborhood. After this dramatic episode, remorse, betrayal, revenge and fear of consequences take over the life of the protagonist, played by the magnetic Nadine Cifre, who also co-wrote the film. The filmmaker directs, writes, acts, edits, mixes, writes the score and sits as director of photography of Clock, Solitude confirming both his independence and his uniqueness in contemporary Argentine cinema. By taking a close look at the characters and without overemphasizing, González shows once more that there are other ways of depicting working-class neighborhoods and their stories through cinema’s imaginary.",
