    "introduction": "1956年柏林国际电影节观众评选最佳影片银熊奖。西班牙国家影评人协会最佳摄影。本片是50年代西班牙新现实主义电影的代表作之一，其风格与同时代的意大利新写实主义电影一脉相承。Ladislao Vajda (August 18, 1906, Budapest - March 25, 1965, Barcelona) was an Hungarian film director that made films in Spain, Portugal, United Kingdom, Italy and Germany. He was born in Budapest, his father beingan actor and director.Vajda started his career as editor (even though he also worked as artistic designer and writer) for different directors, such as Billy Wilder and Henry Koster. Eventually, he undertook his first directorial effort in his native country, Hungary.Soon afterwards World War II, he established in Italy, where he directed two movies. Finally, he moved to Spain. During the 1940s, Vajda directed several movies in Portugal, United Kingdom and, mainly, in Spain.However, his artistic splendor would arrive in the 1950s. Wajda's movies during this period are clearly influenced by German director Fritz Lang. His main works during this period are: The Miracle of Marcelino (also known as Marcelino Pan y Vino) (1955), My Uncle Jacinto (1956), Afternoon of the Bulls (1956), The Man Who Wagged His Tail (1957) with Peter Ustinov, and It Happened in Broad Daylight (1958). They were both critically and public acclaimed: The Miracle of Marcelino and My Uncle Jacinto achieved different prizes in Cannes Film Festival and Berlin Film Festival; Afternoon of the Bulls was nominated for Palme d'Or and It Happened in Broad Daylight for Golden Bear.During the 1960s, Vajda worked on several different minor works in Germany and Spain. He died in Barcelona in 1965.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladislao_Vajda",
