    "introduction": "A sprawling two-hour forty-five minute documentary about screen legend Marlon Brando, features never-before-seen footage and a series of original, in-depth interviews from a wide variety of Hollywood figures and family members. Included are classic film clips from many of his films including \"A Streetcar Named Desire (1951);\" \"Viva Zapata!\" (1952); \"Julius Caesar\" (1953); \"The Wild One\" (1953); \"On the Waterfront\" (1954); \"Guys and Dolls\" (1955); \"The Teahouse of the August Moon\" (1956); \"Sayonara\" (1957); \"The Young Lions\" (1958); \"Mutiny on the Bounty\" (1962); \"The Chase\" (1966); \"Reflections in a Golden Eye\" (1967); \"The Godfather\" (1972); \"Last Tango in Paris\" (1973); \"The Missouri Breaks\" (1976); \"Superman\" (1978); \"Apocalypse Now\" (1979); \"A Dry White Season\" (1989); \"The Freshman\" (1990) and \"Don Juan Demarco\" (1995). Among the many peers, family members and friends making appearances include Ellen Adler, Ed Begley, Andrew Bergman, Bernardo Bertolucci, James Caan, Johnny Depp, Angie Dickinson, Robert Duvall, Jane Fonda, Frederic Forrest, Dennis Hopper, Quincy Jones, Martin Landau, Cloris Leachman, Karl Malden, Kevin McCarthy, Penelope Ann Miller, Edward Norton, Al Pacino, Arthur Penn, Sean Penn, Maximilian Schell, Martin Scorsese, Henry Silva, John Travolta, John Turturro, Jon Voight and Eli Wallach. The program also looks at Brando's involvement in civil rights and features interviews with Russell Means on Brando and the Native American movement; Bobby Seale, on his association with the Black Panthers; and Sacheen Littlefeather, the Native American actress whose on-stage rejection of Brando's Oscar for \"The Godfather\" is the stuff of Hollywood legend. Other interviews include family members and acquaintances that can shed light on Brando's very private life. Written by alfiehitchie",
