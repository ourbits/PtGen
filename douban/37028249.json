    "introduction": "Hong has many circumstances tied to poverty, leading to numerous secrets and misunderstandings. Even as she moves her mother, who is in the early stages of dementia, from a remote nursing home to her small single room, what Hong truly desires isn’t her mother, but her mother’s bank account. Her past relationship is marred by unpaid debts and harsh words, and the new one she’s just begun is precariously adorned with lies in an attempt to make it work. Meanwhile, her dreams remain distant, and her youth slowly fades away. Jang Sun, who won the Actor of the Year at the 20th BIFF, delivers a sensitive performance that turns Hong into something of a mystery. Trapped between relentless misfortune and a desperate grasp for happiness, Hong is a character who is clueless and difficult to decipher. Red Nails shakes the audience’s emotions with its persistent and chilling portrayal of its characters and relationships.",
