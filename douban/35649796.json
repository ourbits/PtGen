    "introduction": "It is impossible to comprehensively map the ultimate extent of the damage wrought by the waves of the corona pandemic in all the layers of the society. It does not, however, require a lot of guesswork to see the links between the steeply increased numbers of corona patients, domestic violence cases and OnlyFans users.Director Masaaki Kudo creates a directly intimate and dauntlessly raw portrait of young people who are enjoying their early twenties in the midst of restrictions in Tokyo and are due to a lack of financial security extremely vulnerable, trying to cope with lost jobs and the ever deepening debts each in their own way. Instead of a conventional melodrama, Kudo offers a dramaturgical approach that is provocatively honest. The result is a very bold look into a world where ambitions are day by day turning more into a mission to simply survive and make do.Elise Eimre",
