It doesn't matter if you're ill or don't feel like leaving. At 10pm people are welcome again. For Jos, this is a day like many other, or isn't it? No, today is different. Jos has a plan. He wants to make amends. Can he convince his ex girlfriend? And his friends? That it's all going to be different now? Jos wants to change. No more drinking. No coke, heroin or other junk. Never again. It's now or never. Well, maybe this week? Jos really wants to change. Starting today, well......at least tomorrow.",
