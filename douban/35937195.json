    "introduction": "Is a dream a reflection of reality or a revelation of unachieved desire? Hong-wha gains the ability to go into others’ dreams due to a side-effect of a new drug trial. She meets serial killer, Jae-in, who can control other people’s dreams, in the dream of a friend who has been kidnapped by him. While the dream and reality are mixed, Jaein whispers to Hong-wha, who is under the pressure of a painful reality, “You wanted to kill someone, didn’t you?” His whisper is nothing but sweet temptation for Hong-wha, who is actually depressed, having lost her aspirations, love and future. However, it is a different story when imagining a murder becomes real, do you become a monster or remain a human being? In Dream reveals a story about three people: one who chooses to become a monster, one who chooses the another way, and a detective who chases them, concealing his desires and inner secrets.",
