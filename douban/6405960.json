    "introduction": "Nervous teacher Connie Bishop is annoying the neighbours with her constant cries that there is an intruder in her house until Jim Hanley is murdered in her garden. Rich bitch Zukie Richardson tells the police Jim was 'obsessed' with Connie and Jim's reasons for leaving the Frobisher Night Committee, organizers of an annual charity auction subsidised by Zukie's husband,retired electronics magnate Howard, are mysterious and unexplained. Womanizing handyman Laurence Mann is killed after telling Connie he knows the murderer's identity and when Justin Cooper,a shy sculptor in love with Connie, stays the night in her house,he sees her sleep-walking. She believes she killed both victims in her sleep, hearing voices in her head saying \"Kill them.\" Investigation shows the house is bugged and the 'voices' all too human - supplied by someone out to frame her. Barnaby pursues his suspect to the Frobisher Night auction to denounce the murderer before the Great and the Good.",
