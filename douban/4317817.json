    "introduction": "Dominik Alber, who earlier directed only one movie - Kori (some low budget vampire shit) decided to direct giallo-style movie.Bad news is he totally failed.Good news, this movie is somewhat watchable due to some nice gory death scenes and some nudity/sex scens.For most of the time it felt like some bad mad for tv german crime/drama with some soap opera parts plus some nudity and gore thrown into the mix. Shit, we even got guts in here, how the the hell was it supposed to be giallo style? stylish violence? more like slasher/ splatter scens in german softcore soap opera i would say. Still, i think that every fan of the genre should see this one just for the of hell it, if not to apreaciete latest Argento works",
