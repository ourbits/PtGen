    "introduction": "Cold War. Yugoslavia, dancing between two superpowers, embraces rock music as part of the \"Yugoslav socialistic youth culture.\" Through the story of YU Grupa, a major 1970s Yugoslav rock band, the doc portrays the heyday and demise of the Yugoslavian utopian experiment and a rock band named after it. A socialist country with Western living standards, the bridge between two blocs, now exists only as a memory. Yet the brothers who formed the band, in their 80s today, still firmly hold the family and the band together long after their country is gone.",
