    "introduction": "Waking, sleep and everything in between proved indistinguishable. This documentary recreates elements of existential banality and guides focus inward. Things play out over and over, but it’s never quite the same: repetition here lulls the rational, while a studious lack of replication sharpens focus and induces contemplation. It’s an interplay of movie (and its constituent elements of light, shadow and audience) mirrored in consciousness (and its building blocks of waking, sleep and dream) if you will.",
