    "introduction": "In 1969, the police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City's Greenwich Village - leading to three nights of rioting by the city's gay community. With this outpouring of courage and unity, the Gay Liberation Movement had begun.After Stonewall, the sequel to Before Stonewall, chronicles the history of lesbian and gay life - from the riots at Stonewall to the end of the century. Narrated by Melissa Etheridge, it captures the hard work, struggles, tragic defeats and exciting victories experienced since then. It also explores how AIDS literally changed the direction of the movement.The two films, Before and After, tell the remarkable tale of how homosexuals, a heretofore hidden and despised group, became a vibrant and integral part of America's family and, indeed, the world community.",
