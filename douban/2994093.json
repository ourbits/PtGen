    "introduction": "A film about finding the path that sets you free, AMERICAN WAKE is a music-infused portrait of a fireman and a musician in search of meaning and connection. Jack Connolly has fulfilled the dream of his late father, a Boston cop, by becoming a distinguished firefighter and hero. But in the aftermath of a blaze in which he lost his oldest friend, he is struggling to make sense of life. As is Niall McKnight, a gifted young fiddle player, whose father harbors the hope that his son will accompany him back to Ireland, a homeland Niall barely remembers. For Jack and Niall to embrace the lives they want to live, and the women they are coming to love, they must choose what to keep and what to leave behind, and learn that with every leap of faith comes both sorrow and joy",
