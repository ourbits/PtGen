    "introduction": "All pets allowed!! Our fur babies. Our companions. Our extended members of the family. Most people look at us and think we are out of our minds for loving our pets so much. But with “Pet Frenzy”, you get to understand why our love for them runs so deep. You get to chat to us and see how we live with them day to day. Each episode, a new animal, a new owner, a new challenge, and new relationship to navigate. Join the frenzy, if you haven’t already.",
