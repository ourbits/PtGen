    "introduction": "This film is a record of a tobacco processing plant near Città di Castello in Umbria, central Italy. The building was filmed in time-lapse, at a rate of one frame every two seconds, from one hour before sunset to one hour afterwards.Tobacco is produced in a number of areas of Italy, and its continued viability as a cash crop depends on EU subsidies. The tobacco is usually blended with Virginia strains to produce a smokable product.",
