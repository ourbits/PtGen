    "introduction": "2017 marks the centenary year of the establishment of Imperial War Museums. It was founded while the First World War was still raging - and over the past century, IWM has expanded hugely (with five sites including the Churchill War Rooms and HMS Belfast).This programme shares stories of those who have lived, fought and died in conflicts involving Britain and the Commonwealth.Presented by Falklands veteran and charity campaigner Simon Weston CBE, it will look at ten key objects from the IWM's collection. Each of the objects will have a special 'advocate' to explore what it reveals about the story of conflict:Bear Grylls ventures onto HMS Belfast; Al Murray looks at a Spitfire at Duxford; the artists Cornelia Parker and Steve McQueen discuss how they have responded to war and loss in their work; Kate Adie (pictured) tells the remarkable tale of the typewriter in the Churchill War Rooms; Dame Kelly Holmes meets the extraordinary Johnson Beharry VC to hear about his experiences in the Iraq War; and Anita Rani explores the incredible heroism of one soldier in the British-Indian Army.",
