    "introduction": "Everything starts from simplicity, but it becomes complicated with the flow of time and space, so does a city. The film takes Custer's concept of \"flowing space\" as the starting point, and decomposes, combines and reorganizes cities, so as to discuss how the human social system relates and influences each other with the ecological system on which they depend, and the contradiction between human social operation and ecological sustainability. Observe the flow and laws of human cities in the same time and space, and try to find the eternal order in chaos.一切从简单开始，但随着时间和空间的流动而变得复杂，城市也是如此。 影片以卡斯特的“流动空间”概念为出发点，对城市进行分解、组合和重组，探讨人类社会系统如何与其所依赖的生态系统相互联系、相互影响，以及城市之间的矛盾。 人类社会运行与生态可持续性。 在同一时空观察人类城市的流动与规律，在混沌中寻找永恒的秩序。",
