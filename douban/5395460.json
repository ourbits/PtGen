    "introduction": "Flesh Eating Mothers is a 1988 film about two-timing cheating housewives that turn into flesh eating zombie-like cannibals. A horrible venereal disease is basically turning an entire town in suburbia into zombies that crave the taste of human flesh. The teens and children in town grow wise to what’s going on and are faced with the tough decision on whether they should just run away, kill their flesh eating moms, or find some other way to stop the cannibalistic flesh eating madness.",
