    "introduction": "Hoping to find everything just as he had left it four years ago, soldier Jeff Compton, who is home on a two-week furlough, visits the New York City department store in which he worked and surprises his former co-worker and sweetheart Jean Kendrick with a kiss. Jean, who is now an executive with the store, has since fallen out of love with Jeff, however, and is dating Walter Medcraft in the accounting department. As Jean never returned the engagement ring that Jeff sent to her while he was away, Jeff believes that she is still his fiancé. Realizing that Jeff is about to get his heart broken, Dilworthy and other department employees band together and, with Jean's consent, work diligently to prevent Jeff from learning the truth about his failed engagement. While Walter is out of town on business, Jean is temporarily assigned to the stock room to keep her away from the other store employees, who might reveal the truth. Jean tries to make the best of her temporary demotion while clumsily hiding her ineptitude at menial stockroom tasks, but trouble mounts when Jeff makes plans for an immediate wedding. After stalling Jeff's rush to marriage, Jean makes hasty arrangements to move back into her former, and more modest, West Tenth street apartment so that Jeff will not suspect that she become more successful. Professor Boris Riminoffsky, a music teacher and a romantic idealist who is currently living in Jean's old apartment, gladly gives up his apartment for two weeks when he learns that it will be done in the name of love. No sooner does Riminoffsky step out of his apartment than Jeff arrives ready to seduce his sweetheart. While Jeff plays a romantic tune for Jean on the piano, Riminoffsky and Dilworthy, who have been getting drunk in a bar, decide to help keep things moving along for the couple by returning to the apartment after Jeff and Jean leave and turning it into a \"garden of Eden\" honeymoon suite. Jeff, still with marriage on his mind, takes Jean for a drive up the coast to visit his great-grandfather and to present her with a gift. Soon after Jeff and Jean return to New York, Jeff visits Walter, who has returned from his trip. Jeff informs him that he plans to marry \"Miss 916,\" and Walter is happy for Jeff until he realizes that \"Miss 916\" is Jean. When Jeff ducks out of Walter's office to buy Jean a wedding ring, Jean tells Walter the truth about her relationship with Jeff. Meanwhile, Jeff learns the truth about Jean and Walter from the jeweler, who has the ring that Walter ordered for Jean ready for delivery. Jeff is devastated by the revelation, but the situation is soon remedied when the department employs a new scheme to reunite Jeff and Jean, and Jean forsakes her relationship with Walter. The department staff, watching anxiously as Jeff and Jean are brought together in a store display, declare the couple \"sold\" when they profess their love for each other.",
