    "introduction": "From his early years as the son of a silent screen cowboy, through the production of some thirty lurid, low budget exploitation pictures including SATAN'S SADISTS, DRACULA VS. FRANKENSTEIN, BRAIN OF BLOOD and THE NAUGHTY STEWARDESSES, to his bizarre and grim demise, the story of filmmaker Al Adamson is told through first person recollection from colleagues, friends, family and archival material of Adamson himself. Go-Go dancers, aging Hollywood actors on their way out, bikers, porn stars, Charles Manson, and an alien being all cross Al's path before he himself becomes the doomed centre piece of a true crime story and manhunt.",
