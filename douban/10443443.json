    "introduction": "This is a road movie about two sisters who leave for their childhood home with their dead mother’s body. Pann is in shock and consumed by sadness after her mother comes to visit her and is suddenly killed in an accident at a shopping mall. Her older sister Pinn, who is working in Singapore, hears the news later and returns to Bangkok. The two sisters then head home with their mother’s body in an ambulance.The road home, however, is not necessarily a sad one. The long-estranged sisters start to learn about each other again through genuine conversation. After the funeral, Pann tells Pinn that she has always known why she ran away to Singapore. Afterwards, the women return to their quiet daily lives. Thus they slowly overcome their sorrow.Director Tongpong Chantarangkul uses the motif of the journey to describe how one woman left her family because of a society’s conventional perspectives and prejudices, but is able to reconcile and come to understand others through familial love. (KIM Ji-seok)",
