    "introduction": "Zhao Xiaobao feels ashamed of having an intellectually disabled older brother – but even more ashamed that he is forced, along with his brother, to attend a mysterious “Whole-brain Development” class by their mother in an effort to boost their intelligence. Under pressure from the adult world, Zhao Xiaobao – like everyone else – pretends to “improve” by telling blatant lies. Unexpectedly, the only one who holds on to honesty and the truth is his intellectually disabled brother. Even in this absurd world, the brother still becomes the target of ridicule and suppression. But this time, Zhao Xiaobao chooses to stand by his brother’s side.",
