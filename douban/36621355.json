Jim, recently committed, only knows her through her voice. When circumstances force him to escape, Jim finds himself in a vacant Los Angeles landscape. There he meets Marin face to face. As Marin becomes part of Jim's life she unknowingly brings back his lost past. It is a story of new beginnings and the sometimes harsh, sometimes surreal dream that is reality.",
