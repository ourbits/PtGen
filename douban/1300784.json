    "introduction": "A 1934 GB production that was picked up in 1937 by Educational for 20th Century Fox distribution about the gannet, (a beautiful white and exceedingly graceful bird deemed the best fisherman in the world), that inhabits a small rocky island off the coast of Wales. One of the few Educational releases that actually was shown in schools, and one would have had to play hookey every day in order to miss seeing this as a Texas school kid in the 40's and 50's. Footage from this short used in many other wild-life films also.",
