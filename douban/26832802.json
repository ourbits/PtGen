    "introduction": "The Don Juan legend crackles to life in the hands of the world's most well-known composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Carefully balancing brilliant comedy with heaping amounts of seduction and ultimate tragedy, Don Giovanni is often referred to as the greatest opera ever composed. From the sparkling overture to one hit musical number after another, this fast-paced San Francisco Opera production features extraordinary Polish baritone Mariusz Kwiecien in the title role. Maestro Donald Runnicles leads the world renowned San Francisco Opera Orchestra and Chorus.",
