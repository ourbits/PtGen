    "introduction": "This award winning series is set in the timeless watercolour landscape of mossy forests, lazy rivers and sunny meadows that is the idyllic home of Little Nutbrown Hare and his father, Big Nutbrown Hare.Always ready to play and laugh, Little Nutbrown Hare bounds through his days with whisker–twitching curiosity. The ever patient Big Nutbrown Hare lovingly leads his son on journeys of discovery of the joys that nature holds. Fun–loving Little Field Mouse and mischievous Little Grey Squirrel often join them on their adventures and not too far away they might encounter tricky Little Redwood Fox, or Little White Owl with her tall tales of mystery and magic. Nearby they might find Otter splashing in the river, or Blue Bird building a nest for her eggs. Together they explore the meadows, forests and streams… playing, laughing and discovering the wonder that the world holds.Keeping love as the major theme, each adventure has a particular season as its backdrop, the wild flowers of Spring; the long, lazy days of Summer; the brilliant colours of Autumn or the frozen landscape of Winter.From the bestselling picture book Guess How Much I Love You™,by Sam McBratney and Anita Jeram. Published by Walker Books.",
