    "introduction": "Agnes and Gregor lead a happy marriage. For 15 years. No crises, no affairs, no weariness. They have sought and found each other, say their friends Conny and Bernhard, who argue often and a lot. If a marriage is harmonious, then this one is. But when Agnes gets socially involved alongside her job, the distribution of roles in the family, which has worked well for years, gets out of balance. The change in their relationship leads Agnes and Gregor into their first big crisis, which neither of them can handle. Shocked, they realise that they are in danger of losing love.",
