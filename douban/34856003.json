    "introduction": "I Am Ahmad, a 1966 13 min. revelatory short, was originally censored before its stormy release. In the film, a naïve Arab manual laborer from the periphery of pre-1967 Israel tries again and again – and is repeatedly refused – to rent an apartment in Jewish and liberal Tel Aviv.Fifty years later, top Arab and Jewish alumni of the Jerusalem Sam Spiegel Film School conduct a poignant dialogue about “today’s Ahmad”, contending with questions of the impossible coexistence between Palestinian citizens of Israel and Jews that is rapidly deteriorating. Comprised of six chapters, the feature film is political, activist and fistful, mirroring a torn Israel. Yet, Voice of Ahmad is at times also funny, poetic and sarcastically utopian.",
