    "introduction": "The innovative and influential British filmmaker was invited to direct the Pet Shop Boys' 1989 tour and this video is the only collection of the vivid, iconoclastic images he created for the background projections. Stunning, specially shot sequences (featuring actors, the Pet Shop Boys and friends of Jarman) contrast with documentary montagest and images of nature, all skillfully edited to the music tracks.Also featured are two additional films set to Pet Shop Boys songs: 'Studio Bankside', Jarman's first ever film, and 'A Garden in Luxor', both of which were used at a special benefit oncert by the Pet Shot Boys and Derek Jarman at Manchester's Hacienda nightclub in May 1992.",
