Enigmatic about his occupation but clear about his financial distress, he seeks an old family friend’s help to sell his deceased father’s house. Ali, a construction foreman from Baku, anticipates a significant career boost. Already appointed assistant to the regional manager of a major road construction unit, he intends to relocate to Goychay, along with his wife and baby son. In the meantime, he lives at his boss’ house and develops a close friendship with him. During the three days it takes to find a new owner for Nijat’s house, everyone involved in the transaction will have to challenge themselves with moral and ethical questions they never had to face before.",
