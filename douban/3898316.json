    "introduction": "Alfredo, a former revolutionary who is blind, deaf and mute, and his hedonistic wife are visited in their seaside house by another couple, just arriving from New York: a frustrated pianist and her husband, an ex-waiter of dubious character. Relationships of hate, love and sex soon develop between them. They swap wives as a liberation gesture. Besides, the pianist gets a little paranoid, thinking his husband and her friend are trying to eliminate Alfredo and herself, to keep her money. In New York, the painter Felipe (Arduíno Colassanti) is a loser, who meets the upper class and aspirant revolutionary Mariana (Irene Stefania) and convinces her to live with him in his own island in Angra dos Reis. Once there, she finds that the place indeed belongs to the blind, deaf and dumb former revolutionary Alfredo (Paulo Porto), who lives in the location with his wife Ulla (Leila Diniz). Sooner, Mariana finds that Felipe has an affair with Ulla, married her only to steal her wealthy and plans to kill Alfredo and her.",
