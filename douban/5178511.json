A Fidesz Jew...Zsuzsa moved from Lajos's house in 2002, She was already totally excluded in the family, their daughter looked through her fingers at. \"You have no sense of nation, you are not capable of raising children!\" - told her husband one day.20 years after the change of regime, which gave the people hope and the feeling of happiness, everybody got confused. Arguments, hate and loneliness... Is there any hope for peace?The film depicts society in Hungary after the 1989 change of regime, in which a polarized political atmosphere has caused major rifts between friends and even within families. The feuding parties turn to mediation techniques to try to achieve reconciliation. In reporting on this mediation process, the documentary displays the deepest feelings of individuals and shows how their deep-rooted political convictions are formed. A broken friendship and a family falling apart... It is the politics which destroyed all of this.",
