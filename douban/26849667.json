    "introduction": "The film explores the two central themes of Sergey Paradzhanov’s works that the great master had been particularly interested in: “Eros and Thanatos”… (Love and Death). His reflections on these eternal and never-to-be-solved mysteries of human nature are conveyed in his films and drawings through Paradzhanov’s unique language that has no analogies.Levon Grigoryan’s film, devoted to this theme, arranges frames and scenes from Paradzhanov’s films, his sketches on the scripts’ margins, collages and drawings into one philosophical and emotional line.Used in the film are some unique, never-before seen by wide audiences, shots from Paradzhanov’s films.",
