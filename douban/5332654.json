She was a nurse by profession who tended to the bedridden wife of Gilbert Hughes until her death. In the time since then, she married Mr. Hughes only to come to the conclusion that he murdered his first wife. Brett advises her that there is little that can be done without evidence but he takes quite a liking to her and they eventually become lovers and marry when Gilbert takes his own life. Little does he realize the consequences of the choices he has made.",
