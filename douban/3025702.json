I am not tired of watching it again, yet. It definitely deserves to be promoted worldwide (anyway, after repairing its technical flaws). The delight is continuous due to its subtle situation humor and the formidable performances from three of the greatest Romanian actors ever: Toma Caragiu, Octavian Cotescu and Marin Moraru. And all those meaningful unfinished phrases, and the pomp of the \"specialist\" fishermen, and their unspoken rivalry transferred from work in that leisure situation, and so on, and so on. Great script, great actors, low budget, technical problems. A very great movie, which MUST be revived.",
