    "introduction": "A transposition of Nikolai Leskov's folk-tale to an Irish setting (refilmed on 16 mm from the original on Super-8), broken up into elusive, ambiguous fragments and using silent movie-type intertitles to convey the dialogue. The result draws a parallel between the act of making a film and the act of picking up and passing on an existing story. Its conceptual challenges are augmented by a harsh, gloomy poetry, crystallised in the Gaelic lament that recurs on the soundtrack.",
