    "introduction": "The lives of animals are not peaceful! They must be able to find food for themselves and their young and avoid becoming food themselves. Sometimes they must also compete with others of their own kind—for food, territory, or mates. Traps, lures and lies are well-known tricks of humans, but they are also skillfully employed by creatures in the animal kingdom. From antlers to horns, humans have long been fascinated by the ability of animals to defend themselves with their natural-born weapons. The creatures featured in this TV series demonstrate how resourceful and inspired nature can be to ensure survival in the animal world.",
