    "introduction": "A drama series following members of the Abraham Lincoln Battalion who came to Spain from the U.S. to fight fascism during the Spanish Civil War. It will follow the Abraham Lincoln and George Washington Battalions, both part of the International Brigade that fought in the Spanish Civil War, from their arrival in 1937 and first bloody battle in the Jarama Valley until their departure in 1939. The show offers a \"compelling and tragic narrative,\" David Simon said, adding that the \"Spanish struggle against fascism and the misuse of capitalism as a bulwark to totalitarianism\" represent \"the preeminent political narrative of the 20th century and of our time still\".",
