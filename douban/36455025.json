    "introduction": "In 2019, Gabon embarked on an ambitious project to enforce the certification and sustainable management of its forests, on every active forest concession throughout its territory. This is the starting point of a virtuous movement and the ten-year struggle of one passionate man, Max Huderbourcq, who fights in the heart of Central African exploitations to bring people, animals and nature together in areas where biodiversity is under threat. This year, Max «returns to battle» as he leads his final gorilla viewing expedition in the forests of Gabon. If we get things done, there is still time to act on what is no longer just an African issue, but a global issue.©GEDEON Programmes 2021COPRODUCTION :  GEDEON Programmes et Clair-obscur productionsEN ASSOCIATION AVEC :  Ushuaia TV",
