    "introduction": "This documentary shows who is and who was Gastón Soublette, an academic of the Faculty of Aesthetics of the Catholic University of Chile. A person who was in the most important moments of our recent history. He eventually became our \"Teacher\", not only in our professor of medieval art or cinema symbology, but rather in a teacher for life, especially in those years when our country lived a civic-military dictatorship and where to express a contrary opinion was brutally punished. He was able to raise his voice next to us.It is what every student looks for in a teacher, someone to believe and someone who really has something to teach. He taught us a way of life and an aesthetic of the everyday, this activity the performance until his body allowed it last year and has left his teaching at 87 years of age.This film wants to travel part of the life of our dear friend and know something of what Gastón still keeps within himself, to transform it into a testimony of an exemplary life.",
