We tell the history of the people who built them: where they came from, how they lived, and how they managed to erect some of the greatest structures ever built by man. Using ground-breaking computer graphics and dramatic construction, this series shows in intimate detail how these buildings were conceived and constructed in an age before modern technology.",
