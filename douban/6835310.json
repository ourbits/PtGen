    "introduction": "In the beginning of Railroad Turnbridge, Serra frames the span of landscape visible through the railroad bridge over the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon. The camera remains stationary, while the bridge rotates 360 degrees, creating an illusion of what is standing still and what is moving. Following the rotation, Serra reveals the sequence of mechanisms that allow the bridge to rotate.",
