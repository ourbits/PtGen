His mother, who runs a boarding house, can see that her maid, Rosie Bloom, is smitten with Ambrose by the way she is always neglecting her work while staring longingly at Ambrose. Despite Ambrose not having asked Rosie to marry him, Ambrose's mother disapproves of a union between the two because she does not want Ambrose to marry beneath him. A telegram that Rosie receives changes Ambrose's mother's mind but it also brings to the surface Ambrose's feelings. Add to the mix a boarder who is in love with Rosie and a traveling female artist who wants Ambrose to model for her and it becomes unclear if any boy will get the girl of his dreams, and visa versa.",
