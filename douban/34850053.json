    "introduction": "Starring Damian Lewis in his first factual role, this new docu-drama reveals remarkable true stories behind the most gripping and significant international spy operations of the last forty years. From the truth behind the escape of US diplomats from Tehran, immortalised in the award-winning film Argo, to the spy operation which narrowly averted all-out nuclear war, to the incredible ‘spy swap’ which brought Sergey Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, to Salisbury (where they narrowly escaped an assassination attempt on their lives last year), the series relates the incredible true stories of the spy wars fought in the shadows. Utilising innovative and highly stylised reconstructions, Damian Lewis: Spy Wars is shot on location in London, Moscow and Israel.",
