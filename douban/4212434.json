    "introduction": "John Cook (1935-2001) was, in his own words, \"Viennese by choice\". Between 1972 and 1982 the Canadian photographer directed four films (three features and a documentary) which hold a unique position in Austrian Cinema: independently produced, featuring a cast and crew of friends and shot on modest budgets. This 2-disc set presents restored versions of Cooks three landmark films produced in the 1970s, as well as extra materials.In Clinch his first \"big\" feature film Cook draws the consequences from his previous work. After self-reflection he turns to the working class again, not in a documentary mode but by adapting a novel by Helmut Zenker. Clinch is no longer a formal hybrid but finds its own modus operandi: neorealism, Vienna style. The film is lyrical, but down-to-earth, its tone is precise without crossing the border to the social grotesque as so many Austrian films unfortunately do. And above all: it shows solidarity with the main protagonist without turning him into a poster hero.",
