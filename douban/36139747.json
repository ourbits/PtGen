    "introduction": "After three years behind bars, Búfalo has decided to change his life—resume his relationship with his son, put it together, find a normal job, stop making mistakes. His past, however, won’t seem to let go and convinces him to do one last hit, but things go awry and debt is no longer with society, but with “El Tano”, a complicated guy who seems unwilling to wait. In his old passion, mixed martial arts close combat, Búfalo will find a means of escape to pay his debts and begin again. Based on Alejandro “el Búfalo” Ortiz’s true story and starring boxer Sergio “Maravilla” Martínez, the new film by Nicanor Loreti tells a story of fighting and redemption in Buenos Aires with warmth and melancholy. In times of despair Búfalo shows that, even to those who have lost everything, there’s always one more chance.",
