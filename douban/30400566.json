    "introduction": "The Award-Winning “Skye’s The Limit” documents one woman’s solo circumnavigation of the Isle of Skye, Scotland, on a Stand up Paddleboard. The adventure serves to highlight the effects of plastic pollution on even stunning, remote and wild places such as this, and brings positive and engaging solutions to the issue. The film follows Cal Major’s epic and dramatic ocean voyage, vulnerable to Scotland’s famous winds, waves and tidal races, alone. Featuring beautiful scenery, wildlife, farm animals and Tunnocks teacakes.",
