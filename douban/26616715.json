Duane skips town sticking Gramps with his enormous debt. \"The Sledge\" offers to take control of Gino's blossoming boxing career in lieu of the money owed but Gramps denies him leading to vicious blow back. Duane returns after ten years to salvage his relationship with Gino but only adds to the growing chaos in Gino's life. Juggling the love of his life, his family debt, and his future is an overwhelming task in Sunset Park.",
