    "introduction": "„Der Mond“ was in many ways the most traditional pop video, but we still found it the most effective promo clip. The populist location and content provided welcome ironic humour and the end section, unconnected to the song, took the video beyong its basic function and aspired to go beyond the limits of the song.",
