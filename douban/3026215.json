He tells her he is going to make a documentary from Daantje's live. Martijn enters her live with a videocamera.

Then Martijn gets between them. He manage to talk her over to remember and talk over the things happend when they were kids. This helps him to overcome his obsession for his sister and after playing over the history he finally is able to see her without the videocamera like he did during the whole movie.",
