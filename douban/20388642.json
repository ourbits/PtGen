    "introduction": "This is a 7-minute short film that Moullet made for the TV-program COURT-CIRCUIT at the occasion of Godard's exhibition at the Centre Pompidou in 2006. In the booklet for Moullet's Pompidou-retrospective in spring 2009, he writes: \"I started from the famous scene in LES CARABINIERS [...], where the two 'heros' line up all the marvels and riches of the earth as picture postcards. Like a tit-for-tat reply, I tried to identify some characteristic features of Godard’s work with the help of postcards.“",
