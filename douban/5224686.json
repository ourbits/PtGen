    "introduction": "Toad Patrol is a Canadian television series which debuted on Teletoon in 1999. The series ended with its second Season in 2002, but continued airing on ToonDisney (the former Disney XD) between 2002 and 2003 with reruns until 2006. It also aired on other international channels, such as the Spanish network Telefutura now known as UniMás (Patrulla de Sapitos), via both network and digital streaming. In 2006, the series aired on the French network France 5 on the Les Zouzous segment (La Petite Patrouille). The show has since been off the air in North America.Although Toad Patrol was initially meant for young children, it also garnered the attention of teenagers and young adults as well. This is theoretically due to the quality of the animation and numerous other aspects of the show: empathetic characters, occasional dark undertones, whimsical soundtrack, a solid, connected plot and a strong storyline.",
