    "introduction": "Gheorghe Blondă is the flamboyant analogue photography lab technician at the national film school in Bucharest. Alleged modernisation plans determine the school management to replace him, ending his lifelong career. On the backdrop of Romania’s biggest anti-corruption protests against the governing populist party, the film turns a humanistic gaze towards an institution that works as a mirror to the higher governing forces in its country. Gheorghe's fight for his job becomes a matter of life and death, much more than a technological transition.",
