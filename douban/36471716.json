    "introduction": "\"Featherfall\" is based on research in online forums in which video players exchange their dream experiences. It becomes clear how close dream and game worlds can come to each other in the psyche of the users and what feedback can develop between the two alternative realities. \"Featherfall\" ties in with the archetypal nightmare of \"falling down\", which often occurs during puberty and a glitch that exists in video games, through which the avatar falls beneath the surface into the empty, non-programmed space.源自：https://festival.curtas.pt/en/film/fc-8680/",
