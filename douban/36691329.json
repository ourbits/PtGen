    "introduction": "It’s 1997 and two Interpol agents, No and Chase (Esther Garrel and Alex Zhang Hungtai from the band Dirty Beaches), are assigned to investigate the mysterious death of a coral smuggler in Mexico. As their investigation takes them into weirder and more tropical realms, they become caught up in a probable international conspiracy involving an inappropriately sexy coral scientist, two wellness-loving interns, lectures on neuropsychology and platonic absolutes, a psychic network of coral reefs, wine-tasting that doubles as a team-building exercise for a utopian basketball team, and a bewildering invisible colleague. Meanwhile the agents’ platonic relationship, always professional, always tender, burns almost to the point of bright molten lava.",
