    "introduction": "Goruck's Selection is not only one of the toughest endurance events on the planet, it's also an attempt by its creators to bridge the military-civilian divide. Hosted by a group of Special Forces combat veterans, this 48-hour challenge is a condensed interpretation of the US Army's 24-day Assessment and Selection. For the participants, the event is a chance to test their limits while paying tribute to those who serve. For the Cadre, it's an opportunity to honor their community and connect with civilians. Less than 2% of participants finished the first 18 iterations of the event. Will anyone in Class 019 meet \"The Standard?\"",
