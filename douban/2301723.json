    "introduction": "Imam Hasan, his wife Hacer and his daughter Fatma arrive at Karaaðaçli, a small railway village in the middle of the Anatolian wilderness. Besides carrying out the duties of the Iman, Hasan will be teaching religion to the children of the village during the holy month of Ramadan. Before too long, his unusual behavior towards his wife and little daughter arrests the attention of the townsfolk. Meanwhile little Adem (Firatcan Aydin), the son of the stationmaster, who is crazy for trains, begins to learn about and get into a world he has never heard of before in the lessons given by Hasan: trains, sin, good deeds, heaven and hell...everything gets jumbled. He makes a close friend with Fatma. Imam Hasan is condemned for being harsh and merciless towards his family, but one day he finds himself obliged to reveal the \"secret\" about himself and his family. This changes everything in the eyes of villagers. Yet there has remained another secret of which anyone, even Hasan, is hardly aware. The people of the town, including little Adem, will remember this Ramadan for the rest of their lives.",
