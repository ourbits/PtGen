They fear, rightly, that family after family will move away and the town will disappear. Their hopes are raised when Bob announces his widower son Michael the surgeon and grand daughter are going to visit for the first time in years for the Xmas holiday. The mayor's attempt to recruit Michael is complicated by their history (their high school romance) and his secret shame (that he has lost his confidence in his surgical skills to the point that his big city hospital is kicking him upstairs to an administrative position).",
