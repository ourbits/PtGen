    "introduction": "Ding-You, who plays the role of civil messenger in his GENERAL CLUB, is greatly troubled by the conflict of his family's expectation and his own dream after high school. Although he has always wanted to study art but he has never told his father about it because his father expects him to study in a national university. He got a chance to interview for an art school's admission but it clashed with their procession date. What's worse was that his disturbed mind has impeded his ability to invoke his god. Despite of his friend's constant support, he must deal with the problem among his father, his god and himself.",
