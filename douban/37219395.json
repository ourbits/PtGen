    "introduction": "Retired from his garage business, Clem Hawley spends his time and money in the company of Al, the local bootlegger, much to the anguish of his family. Clemmy, his son, is employed at a bank owned by his cousin Webster and makes nightly trips to New York to see Ina Heath, a showgirl, whom he impresses as being the son of a wealthy family. Traveling with some friends, Ina stops by their town on Long Island and is dismayed to learn of Clemmy's humble background; but when she is stranded, she decides to stay for dinner. Mrs. Hawley is informed of the disappearance of some valuable stock certificates. Clemmy confesses to the theft and to having given Webster the stock as a loan, but Old Clem takes the blame. Ina and Clem then force the hand of Webster, who is in cahoots with the bootleggers; Clem saves his son from admitting his wrong to Mrs. Hawley; and Clemmy and Ina are happily reunited.",
