    "introduction": "I can’t tell my name. I’m 3 months pregnant and don’t like my job but it would be worse if someone else was doing it. I live with my boyfriend. We take care of people. We want to go away from this city. We have enough money, but they brought us another guest. He is 7 or 8 years old. We didn’t take care of any kid before. At the beginning, I hardly dare to enter his room. But then I get closer to him. It looks like he’s getting sick and my boyfriend doesn’t want to do anything. I shouldn’t take him outside; it’s dangerous, even more if the boss finds out. I’m afraid something bad happens to him. I hope they pay the rescue soon.",
