Once upon a time, it was the age of innocence, the age of sweetness, the age when one had the first crush. But times have changed. In the times of Internet, Delhi times and page-3 and more than 300 Tv channels, innocence is the first casualty. Sixteen is a story about lost innocence and teenage heartache in urban India. Meet Anu - Young, intelligent, good looking, sensitive, ambitious. Brash, bold with lots of attitude. She's almost a woman now. In the way she dresses, in the way she approaches life. She is aware of the effect she has on the men around her. She has been through breakups (note the plural), has flings and wants to be the Miss India. So that she can one day rule the glamour world. Meet Tanisha- In search of love, withdrawing at the slightest notice of an imperfection, Tanisha is gutsy, but more rooted. Going on a blind date is not a problem with her. ...",
