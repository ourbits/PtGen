    "introduction": "Joe Nighthawk used to serve in the San Francisco Police Department but got burned out by having to use lethal force one time too many. Now, the part-Indian lawman is working with the police in Arizona hunting small-time hoods and drug lords. That is, until he encounters two gentle people who have run afoul of a ruthless cocaine baron. When he tries to protect them from the mobster, he's rather badly beaten up, since he gave up practicing the martial arts years ago. Now he is in training to do some serious head bashing, and is reconsidering whether or not he's prepared to kill the bad guys again in the line of duty. ~ Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide",
