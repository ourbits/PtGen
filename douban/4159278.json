    "introduction": "Nite Tales is a horror anthology introduced by Flava Flav that includes two movies, Karma and Storm.KarmaThe first movie, Karma, tells the tale of four young thieves and their effort to rob a small-town bank. They are lead by a very aggressive young man who is prepared to succeed at his quest using any sort of violence he deems necessary. His three associates vary greatly in their commitment level to the robbery and their personal needs to introduce guns and therefore, potential bloodshed into the robbery scheme. As one would expect, the robbery becomes a bloody rampage, ultimately killing at least one bank employee and seriously wounding one of the thieves. The four men then escape with their loot until their car breaks down in the dark on a lonely country back road. Soon they find an old, decrepit house in the woods. Outside the house is a car that they hope to steal to assist in their continue escape. But, in order to do so, they must enter the house and find the keys. They soon find that he house is occupied by a family that may soon teach them the truth of the old adage, crime does not pay.StormIn the second film, Storm, a few college students quickly learn not to fool around with the legend of Bloody Mary. The friend, foolishly decide to tempt their fates by staring into a mirror and repeating Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary several times. They soon discover that dreams can come true! In a matter of minutes the cheerful college party becomes a scene of murder and mayhem. The movie transforms into a whodunit of sorts as we try to determine which of the players is responsible for the murders. Could someone close to them be responsible for the murders or is the legend of Bloody Mary more than just a parlor game?",
