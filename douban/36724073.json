Scorpius Malfoy, who like Albus is in the Slytherin section, is the same age as James Sirius in this adaptation. Jealous of the relationship between Scorpius and Albus, James is in a kind of conflict with Malfoy to be the best brother. In this case, the prophecy of King Arthur's Monster, which occurs every 100 years, hits Hogwarts. A great adventure awaits our Potters and their friends who can't get out of trouble.",
