    "introduction": "Ceux qui rougissent follows a supply teacher (played by Julien Gaspar-Oliveri himself) who upsets the monotony of a Swiss high school (or a gymnasium, as they’re known in Switzerland). In charge of a workshop in a theatre which smells of damp, the newcomer unsettles his students’ habits by suggesting they \"live\" drama with passion, as if it were an art rather than a hobby. This company composed of eleven students rediscovers Shakespeare’s Midsummer Night’s Dream thanks to their new teacher, who acts not only as a guide who leads them towards the beauty of the text but who also unearths talent.",
