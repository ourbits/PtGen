    "introduction": "Tomislav Radic was born in 1940 in Zagreb, graduated in 1962 at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb and at the Academy of Dramatic Art in Zagreb in 1973. Since 1965 until today he directed in all Zagreb theaters, he was an occasionally guest at the Dubrovnik Summer Festival and an associate for national television. From 1977 until 1997 he taught acting and directing at the Academy of Dramatic Art in Zagreb and from 1998 to 2000 he was the editor of the Drama program on Croatian national television.Radic made around 40 documentaries and docudramas for television and several films. His documentary Ziva istina (1971) was described by the critics as combination of direct film methods and a series of documentary segments which describe everyday life in a city, while following a young actress in search of work. His Timon (1972) was thought to be an original paraphrase of Shakespeare's text where the life of the main character becomes mixed with the life of the character he is playing.",
