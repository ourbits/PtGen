    "introduction": "An intimate and picaresque inquiry into Gay life. A mixture of documentary, diary and personal fiction, Queer Diaries is a sensitive and philosophical journey. For the starting point of an unfinished film, a filmmaker lives, travels and records his memories in the shape of audiovisual poems and short stories. The result is a political manifesto in favor of queerness. What are the models of family and happiness that we follow? What movies shall we make for the new world? Shown with Haiku from a Dead Poet directed by Akira Kamiki.",
