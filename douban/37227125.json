    "introduction": "Emmanuel, a young musician without a mother, dreams of being famous. But his father, a senior civil servant, is fiercely opposed to his passion. He’d rather his son followed in his footsteps than pursue dreams he believes are doomed to failure. When Emmanuel persists in his ambition, Pierre kicks him out and uses all his energy to get him to fall in line. Emmanuel takes refuge with his maternal uncle Jean, an eccentric, lonely, penniless painter. This chaotic cohabitation changes Emmanuel’s outlook on himself, his art, and his relationships with others. Not only with his family, who will turn out to hold many secrets about him, but also with Sarah, his girlfriend, and professional rival. In the end, he loses Sarah, and his relationship with his family is permanently damaged. But he gains a spiritual father and maturity that will enable him to better understand the musical career he has finally decided to fully embrace.",
