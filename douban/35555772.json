The main reason behind this is that college rock band \\'The Heroes\\' will play that night and, most importantly, the band\\'s lead singer Fernando will be there. Cami has a big crush on Fernando and has come up with a plan to hook up with him. Despite things not turning out as expected, she will still learn important life lessons out of her big night out.",
