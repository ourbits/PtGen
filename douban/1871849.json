    "introduction": "In the wake of the 1972 Munich massacre, Israel decides to create a covert hit team dedicated to killing individual terrorists throughout Europe. Avner, Israeli commando and son of a renowned Israeli agent, is recruited to head a team of five specialists on a continent-wide manhunt to bring justice to those who support and architect such terrorist attacks. The team will operate with absolutely no official sanction, outside the bounds of all national laws, literally operating exactly as the terrorists do. His father warns him against trusting the agency because he was left to rot in a French prison after they disavowed all knowledge of his actions, but he believes it will not happen to him. His wife Shoshanna supports him, but worries about what will become of him after they are finished. Working from safehouses established all across Europe and utilizing an underground criminal information network, they stalked and killed high-level terrorists one by one. After the deaths of several of his team, Avner and the survivors are recalled to Israel, where he decides to quit and has to fight against the Israeli government to be allowed to live in peace with his wife and newborn son.",
