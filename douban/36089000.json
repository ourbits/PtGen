    "introduction": "Lash is the third feature film by director Jung Yoon-suk, who received attention at home and abroad with Non-fiction Diary and Bamseom Pirates Seoul Inferno. An international project that spans across Korea, China, and Japan, Lash challenges viewers to think fundamentally about the human existence and humanity. The three chapters titled “Messenger,” “Message,” and “Messiah” feature workers of a Chinese sex doll factory, a politician dreaming of innovating the Japanese political system with AI robots, and a middle-aged Japanese man living with a sex doll. The film doesn’t judge or assess them hastily for dryly saying “It would be okay for humans to disappear” or “I hate living humans.” However, it makes us think long and hard about their hatred and distrust of humanity. It offers an ontological reflection looking back at the age of artificial intelligence from a different angle.",
