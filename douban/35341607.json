    "introduction": "Marina lives in Paris and writes about the Soviet monotowns - the industrial settlements built for the needs of one giant factory. To finish her research she goes back to her native Ukrainian monotown which still remembers the suicide of her father-miner 18 years ago. Her unexpected discoveries about her own roots will put in danger the identity of the whole town and become a threat for the memory of her father’s life and death. Marina faces a difficult personal choice: to restore collective memory as a scientist or to honour private memories as a daughter.",
