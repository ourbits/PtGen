    "introduction": "Marta Balletbò-Coll是西班牙加泰罗尼亚女导演，她的作品大多关注女同题材，而且自编自导自演，她被人称为“西班牙的女性伍迪-艾伦”。本片获95年旧金山国际同性恋电影节观众评选最佳影片奖。In Barcelona, Anna is a tour guide working on her monologue, in which she's a Communist housewife whose lesbian neighbor is an object of curiosity. She's sent an audition tape to San Francisco's Another Stage. While giving a tour, she meets Montserrat, American, Jewish, teaching in Barcelona and unhappy with her job. Montserrat, claiming \"I'm not a lesbian,\" approaches Anna; they start a relationship, and with occasional trips to the Costa Brava, it becomes a romance. Anna helps Montserrat find another job, but it's in the States. Their parting seems inevitable. They take a last trip to the Costa Brava and keep praying. Does God have a miracle in store?A Fulbright Scholar from Barcelona, Marta Balletbò-Coll received an MFA in film directing from Columbia University in New York. Her 1995 feature film Costa Brava, released in English on video by Naiad, was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award and won the Audience Award at the San Francisco International Lesbian & Gay Film Festival. It is now available on dvd (PAL format only). Marta's 2004 feature Sévigné won numerous awards in Spain and is also available on PAL dvd. She has been called Spain's female Woody Allen and is the witty star of both features and shorts, as well as writing and directing.",
