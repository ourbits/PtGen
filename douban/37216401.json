    "introduction": "Agent of Decay is an attempt to celebrate the abstraction of moving images. The film centers around fungi, wind, contamination, and decay. It’s a metaphor for traveling spores from the West Coast Pacific to bomb craters in Laos. Using 16mm expired film stock with hand-painted animation presents the paradox of randomness VS non-persistence vision, the overwhelming speed VS stillness, and a displaced person in a wasted landscape.",
