The car that Alex hates and his father loves, becomes an intimate setting for two stubborn men, who are forced to deal with their issues as they are both literally and figuratively brought together. The journey becomes a bumpy ride filled with conflicts as well as shared memories of a past closeness, which has long since turned cold.",
