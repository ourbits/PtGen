    "introduction": "Documentarist Huseyin Karabey's first movie. The movie tells the true story about Ayça Damgaci's road trip, from Istanbul to Northern Iraq to see/visit her boyfriend.Ayça is a Turkish actress in her 30s, living in Istanbul. She meets Hama Ali Khan (a famous Kurdish actor in 50s) during a production of a movie. They fall in love immediately. After the movie is completed, unfortunately they are separated; Hama Ali turns back to Norhern Iraq, and Ayça goes back to Istanbul. However their love continues via letters. Hama Ali sends Ayça very funny video letters.The war is severe and Ayça loses communication with him. So she goes crazy and plans a road trip to see and visit her love. Despite everyone's, this trip was a reverse one, from Istanbul to Suleymaniye to the center of war. When she arrives to the Turkey-Iraq border, she learns that the border is closed. So they decide to meet in another location, Umriye - Iran.I am very impressed of Ayca's brave trip and also her passionate love for Ali. She listens to her heart even if that means risking her life. Furthermore, the movie gives you the chance to observe the circumstances of local people in the East of Turkey and all along the way to Umriye.",
