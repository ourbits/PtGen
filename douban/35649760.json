    "introduction": "Greece, Russia, USA, Brazil, China, Senegal. Meeting young people in these countries we heard a 'Rumble' foretelling an impending explosion. The fall of communism, crisis of capitalism, ecological catastrophes, migration waves, globalization. The new generation is at the forefront, exposed, helpless without being able to envision a more optimistic future. This 'Rumble' comes from this young generation. Their words, images, sounds and music compose the notes of an audio-visual symphony entitled: 'The Rumble of the World'.",
