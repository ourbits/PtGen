    "introduction": "In this video piece José Toirac presents a condensed version of one of revolutionary leader Fidel Castro’s marathon speeches to the nation, which generally are broadcast on TV. While naked statistics roll in quick succession over the screen, black on white, Castro’s speech shrinks acoustically to a mechanical recitation, bereft of all meaning. Toirac subverts Castro’s legendary rhetoric and thereby poses no mean challenge to the mechanisms of political propaganda.",
