    "introduction": "This is a special feature included on the bonus disk for Clint Eastwood's film \"Unforgiven\". While there is another short specifically labeled the 'making of' film, \"All on Accounta Pulling' a Trigger\" is also a making of short. This one is a bit different from a typical one for two main reasons. First, unlike most, the screenwriter gets his say and it was interesting to hear how happy he was that what was filmed actually was what he wrote--as he said that was not typical in Hollywood. Second, a lot of the film had the various stars discussing how they felt the film had something to say about the pointlessness and destructiveness of violence--something you normally don't think about in a western! And, because you get to see all the stars interviewed and there are a few interesting tidbits, it's worth seeing--particularly if you liked \"Unforgiven\". Not great but very good.",
