    "introduction": "Actor Gustavo Garzón and theater director Mariana Sagasti seek to puzzle out the real author behind one of the most important figures in universal literature: William Shakespeare.On the enigmatic Shakespearean ringlets, the documentary Searching for Shakespeare raises its doubts, opens its questions and finds others along the way. Configured from two units -one historical, located in London; the other theatrical, in Buenos Aires-, it enthrones the obsession for the author and the secrets that make him up. Did he work alone? Did he have partners? Did he really exist! Thus, anointed under that trail of questions, there are clues about the role of Freemasonry, some spiritual scrolls and an extensive menu of testimonies that may even generate some itching. But its purpose is not controversy, but a desire to know what's behind the scenes. Because, at the end of the day, whatever it is, all is true.",
