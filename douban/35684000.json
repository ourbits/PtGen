Teun is at the beginning of his puberty and notices that his mind thinks his own way, he can't control his hormones. The camping is the perfect place for this. Roos, a young woman in the middle of her puberty, is more interested in her first camping love, than in her family. Teun notices that his sister is becoming a woman, in all different ways. How does he react? What does he do with his feelings? Does it have any influences on the brother-sister relationship?",
