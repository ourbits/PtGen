In this series, we go back, decode that chain of events, and deconstruct the disaster that followed.Coming off of prime-time success of season one—which sold to over 20 territories across the world, including RMC France and NTV Germany — DESTRUCTION DECODED is back for a second season. The new series decodes the chain of events and circumstances that led to the world’s worst maritime disasters: we delve into devastating building collapses across the globe and uncover how a fun day at an amusement park can end in disaster.S2 E1 CrashesS2 E2 Disasters at SeaS2 E3 CollapsesS2 E4 DamsS2 E5 Space DisastersS2 E6 Motorsport DisastersS2 E7 Amusement ParksS2 E8 CollisionsS2 E9 Expeditions/AdventuresS2 E10 Global ThreatProduction company: Big Media, RMC Production, Wild Bear Australia",
