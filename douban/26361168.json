    "introduction": "In May 2015 the Euro-sceptic UK Independent party wins the election and comes to power. British born and educated Sikh Deepa Kaur is elected the MP for Romford and becomes the party's poster girl, accentuating her patriotism over her ethnicity as increasingly harsh raids are carried out on anybody suspected of being, or employing, illegal immigrants. As the party pulls out of the European union jobs suffer, affecting Deepa's own family, and anti-UKIP groups clash with right wing factions in the capital. Matters come to a head when a young boy, Sadir, is injured during a raid but still accused of assault on the police. Deepa realizes that it is time for her to put her principles above her political ambitions and speak out.",
