    "introduction": "Diego Gardini (Ruffini) is a highly successful entrepreneur, a major wheeler and dealer who knows just about everyone in show-business. He is also an extremely obnoxious, selfish, egotistical lout who doesn’t care about anyone but himself. One day, he loses his cell phone in a public washroom just before an overseas flight. Two janitors find the phone and, to avenge Gardini’s mistreatment of them, choose to flood Gardini’s social media accounts with scandalous messages and pictures. Given Gardini’s fame as a socialite, the messages go viral, jeopardizing Gardini’s job and future. Modalità Aereo is a high-concept film filled with slapstick moments, embarrassing scenes, misunderstandings and humiliation, in the tradition of classic Italian comedies.",
