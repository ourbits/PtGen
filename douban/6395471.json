His father Mehdi, a retired customs enforcement officer, believes that Emrah is going to become a pharmacist. Emrah manages to cobble together funding from producers with the help of his friends and his mother Şahane, but is held up by the bureaucracy. The main obstacle between him and his dreams is an endorsement letter he needs from Müzeyyen, the head of the censorship board. But this proves more difficult than he expected...Standing up to authority in pursuit of his ideals, this young man finds himself entangled in a vehement struggle against this petty official who blindly enforces a senseless law.",
