    "introduction": "At the end of WWII, on a remote stretch of New Zealand's southern coast, two crewmen from a German submarine are sent ashore in the dead of night on a secret mission - to get fresh milk. Meanwhile, home alone in her farm cottage, Edith wakes to the sound of trespassing footsteps. Following them, she soon discovers that the two men milking her cow are more than intruders - they are the enemy. But when she confronts them, shotgun in hand, she is forced to navigate the slippery line between friend and foe.",
