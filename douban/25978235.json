    "introduction": "Tristan (10) and his family live in Kudelstaart. Their family is an unusual one because both Tristan’s parents are deaf, while Tristan himself can hear just fine. Tristan is great at talking to deaf people, but other people find it difficult or sometimes even uncomfortable. This stands in the way of Tristan’s father becoming the coach for Tristan’s football team. The club says his father can never be a good coach. Tristan thinks that’s nonsense. His father is a brilliant football player he even plays for the Dutch national team for the deaf. Tristan is confident that his Dad would make a good coach and that his team members would feel the same way if he were just once given a chance to prove himself.",
