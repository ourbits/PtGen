    "introduction": "A strange little miniature that drifts between sentimentality, surrealism, and social satire. It's quarter to nine, the young son is peacefully sleeping on the couch, the loving caring mother has to go out to shop a few things (milk and cream?). The customers in the store who queue before her are obnoxious and everyone seems to take hours. The cash register gets repaired. Planned economy inefficiency. Mother has horror visions of what might happen to her loved son at home right now: the youngster tries out dad's shaving things and razor blade. An armed criminal raids the flat, even worse: he leaves his loaded gun to play for the boy... the son plays with matches... and takes a climb out of the window on the building facade... In short: the horror. A mother's heart never rests.If one believes the credits, then this is really special: directed by Roman Kachanov, art direction by Leonid Shvartsman and yes, Yuriy Norshteyn is credited as the only animator. Early 70's Soyuzmultfilm Dream Team.",
