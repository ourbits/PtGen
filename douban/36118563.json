    "introduction": "It is a summer tradition to escape the heavy heat of the Tunisian sun and find one’s friends by the pool, the greatest pool of all, the Mediterranean. “La Piscine” is an impression of a place and time, a slice of life in the small seaside town of Tabarka. It is a film in two parts: The first lyrically evokes the filmmakers’ vision of an idyllic summer landscape, and the second follows a group of boys who show up every day without fail to run, jump, and swim.",
