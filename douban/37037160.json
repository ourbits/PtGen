    "introduction": "In this densely told ensemble piece, three siblings are confronted with their family’s tragic past. The three meet again on a summer’s day to clear out their family home before putting it on the market. While they sort through the things, one sister comes across a mysterious photo of a young man, whose memory still haunts her today. It seems to have been taken outside the house on the day of his fatal accident. As she can’t remember taking the picture, she starts researching and at some point she is sure that the photographer was someone else. Layer by layer, she uncovers a past that contains a bitter truth.",
