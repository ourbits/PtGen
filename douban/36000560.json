    "introduction": "The almighty and all-knowing Jesus Christ (33), an equally all-knowing auntie Anka (57), and a curious hog Beba (2) in the rolling hills of the Croatian region of Zagorje during the war of the 1990s. In terms of weapons, only a hunting rifle and a plastic gun. The intricate sweet and sour twist and turns are dominated by the drama of first love between pigs at the moment of an air-raid and the malfunction of a hood at a hairdresser’s mid-styling. A wedding, a patron saint day of the church, playful songs, Mother of God, cheese, cream and a happy end – included. Other than pigs at slaughter, nobody gets hurt. But there are 16 newly born, however!",
