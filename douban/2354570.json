    "introduction": "Since 1979, Billy Childish has released two novels, over thirty books of poetry, and over a hundred albums with his various garage-punk outfits. The man is prolific to say the very least. Hes also a fascinating figure, and despite the inconsistency of his artistic output, its all embedded with a raw honesty thats unfortunately missing from most of the artistic world. Childish is a true original who deserves a bigger audience than hes currently saddled with (his strict do it yourself ethics may have something to do with this).The documentary does a very good job of illustrating the appeal and unique style of Childish's art and providing the appropriate amount of back story. While the editing leaves a bit to be desired (the sequencing of interviews seems to be almost random at times), the footage on hand is always fascinating. If you're interested in getting into Childish, this may be a good introduction point. Now if only more of his wonderful poetry was available in the States.",
