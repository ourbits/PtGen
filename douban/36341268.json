But this new release marks the debut of writer and screenwriter Jimina Sabadú, as one of the objectives of this label, among others, is to open up opportunities for new directors in the fantasy genre to direct projects.According to the synopsis, Juana (played by Watling) is a nun with a strong character, marked by a paranormal experience. A mysterious assignment from the Archbishopric will lead her to an old church in old Madrid, built on a network of passages of unknown origin. She will soon discover that in the depths of the building there is something older than the legends that are told about that place... and the Evil that dwells there has begun to infect the outside.",
