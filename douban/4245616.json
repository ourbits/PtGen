    "introduction": "\"In a town in southern Sweden, Sven Klang decides to enliven his dance combo with a new sax player, Lasse from Stockholm. At first all goes well; but bit by bit Lasse brings into question all the rigid values, musical and social, by which the faintly supercilious Sven has set his life's course. Gunnel, the vocalist, falls for the newcomer's charms and finds herself pregnant when Lasse and Sven eventually part in high dudgeon. The daily round continues. Eventually Lasse pops up again, and disappoints all save Sven by turning tail in the face of Gunnel's love and his sense of guilt at having fathered her child....The appeal of Sven Klang's Combo lies in its utter lack of pretension, in its small town atmosphere and its vivid characterisation. One imagines that the actors were able to improvise their lines and contribute personal touches that fleshed out their roles. Their autobiographies become fiction; but fiction, as so often, also becomes truth. This film recognises that big emotions stem from small incidents and that one is forever a prisoner of one's generation.\" (Peter Cowie, 1978 International Film Guide)\"What gives Stellan Olsson's film distinction is that for the first time in my experience of films to do with jazz the characters are as engaging as the music. And both are played with truth: (Eric Shorter, Daily Telegraph)Stellan Ollan Olsson was born in 1936 in Kattarp, south Sweden. He took his B.A. at the University of Lund, majoring in Humanities. After a breif spell in the Stockholm Film school, Olsson returned to his previous teaching profession before making his first film. He is also a theatre and TV director, photograper and painter.",
