    "introduction": "When Nadia, a video editor and aspiring actress, books the role of a lifetime, little does she know the film footage will be implicated in a deep fake scandal threatening the career of Leonard Reese, the British Minister of Immigration. After going to the media to clear her name and expose the role of deep fakes in the scandal, she, herself, becomes a victim of deep fakes. As Nadia's controversial and divisive doppelganger - Lola Dust - becomes a notorious and terrifying internet sensation, Nadia must decide between laying low and living with the truth or going on a quest to fight back the people behind Lola Dust. With the help of Margaret, Nadia discovers the \"real\" Lola Dust and exposes the hidden world of influence campaigns and fabricated scandals.",
