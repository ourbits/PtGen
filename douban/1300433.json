    "introduction": "All the lights are gone in New York during a citywide power failure.Four dangerous criminals escape from the prison bus and hide in a posh apartment building owned by wealthy Ray Milland.The convicts begin to terrorize the residents and it's up to Jim Mitchum to stop the orgy of violence and abuse...I haven't seen Eddy Matalon's tedious \"Cathy's Curse\" yet,but \"Blackout\" is a pretty tense exploitation thriller.The action is exciting and the cast is impressive.The few scenes of violence are quite hard-hitting.If you are into 70's gritty and washed out excursions into urban paranoia give \"Blackout\" a chance.This obscure flick deserves to be seen.8 blackouts of 10.",
