    "introduction": "Munich in the late Sixties must have been the coolest place on earth. At least when you look at some of the movies that were made around that time. \"Detektive\" is Rudolf Thome's feature debut, one year before he shot \"Rote Sonne\" (Red Sun) Link , and naturally it was a movie about girls and guns (and two cool dudes, proto slackers). The story is almost forgettable, it's all about the style. And, of course, Uschi Obermaier, the star of \"Rote Sonne\", whom Thome had discovered for \"Detektive\". (Consequently, for most of the time, Uschi runs around in her undies) The dialogues are hilarious, super deadpan, the crime plot is ridiculous, the cinemathography (b/w and scope) beautiful. Heavily indebted to the French Novelle Vague and Hollywood's classic gangster films, \"Detektive\" is miles away from the German New Wave around Wenders, Kluge and Fassbinder. That's what makes this little flic, shot with friends on weekends (and between tours through the bars in the Schwabing district), so special.In the lead, the great Marquard Bohm, something like the German Belmondo (a face like no other) and Uli Lommel, who went on to direct the German serial killer film \"Die Zärtlichkeit der Wölfe\" and numerous Hollywood b movies. Nuff said. Enjoy this very special gem!",
