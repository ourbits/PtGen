    "introduction": "September 11 2001 was a day of many incredible and shocking stories: stories of survivors, stories of heroes. But there was one story that people didn't want to face. The story of the people who began to jump from the World Trade Center just minutes after the first plane hit. Their images were caught on videotape and in photographs, but soon they were never seen again, as if they had never existed.Among those pictures is one of the most unforgettable images from 9/11 - a photograph of a falling man, frozen in mid air, his body perfectly parallel with the twin towers of the World Trade Center.",
