If people can fly to the moon this year, then heaven will be next and God would never allow that to happen. Her religious father Mees is even more worried. He must cope with modern-day technology, and running such a large household has driven him to drink. Caro feels close to God and prepares diligently for her First Holy Communion. She makes a deal with her father. If he promises not to drink until her first communion day then in return she will learn to swim, but Mees succumbs and the day ends in disaster. Consequently, Caro starts doing extraordinary things beyond her control while Mees falls into a state of apathy. But a new flock of pigs brings with it fresh hope. When they eventually land on the moon Caro is ot interested. She prefers to look at the moon herself. Meanwhile she has learned to swim, God has become a vague acqaintance and she no longer worries about things beyond her control. She has become a carefree child and welcomes a new life.",
