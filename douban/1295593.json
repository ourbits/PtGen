    "introduction": "Throughout the film it shows, in the late 1930s, Jewish citizens being taken away by the army or secret police (with rather stirring music). At this moment Klaus Maria watches on and seems to be a little shaken and quietly incensed by these actions. This film gives an insight into, how some germen were clearly against what Hitler was starting to do to their country (those who, in reflection, weren't sucked into the propaganda of a powerful Germany). The love interest with Rebecca Miller and Klaus is nice and subtle with good humour in places. During all this, though, he is building a bomb using his skills as a clock maker, and awaiting Hitler's arrival to the Beer Hall (Munich), -where the story is set. During the building of the bomb and the placing of it, it is full of tension with Klaus appearing extremely determined and nervous with sweat. The acting of Brandauer is suitably magnificant.",
