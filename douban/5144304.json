    "introduction": "What are the acceptable reasons to leave everything behind and just take off? Sebastian loses his job on a small fishing boat. His girlfriend waits for him at home, but their worlds have long drifted apart and no longer seem compatible. He feels similarly about New York. Sebastian submerges into the green, into the water. Without a script and with a lot of devotion to improvisation, The Madness of the Day remains with the uncertainty of its protagonist and takes us quietly into the lesserknown idyllic scene of upstate New York.A European Film Conspiracy, 2011.Cast:Sebastian NaskarisJulia CrockettWilton StewartDanielle OlsenRon CocuzzaLuke Forbes, Jason SheltonCrew:Daniel Hoesl  Direction, Idea, Sound, ProductionNatalie Schwager EditingLeif Huron Lafferty-Gebauer Camera, ProductionGerhard Daurer SounddesignProud Parents  (Wilton Stewart) SoundtrackHans Renzler Title DesignMegan Larkin CostumesJimmy Hennrich Colors, Postproduction",
