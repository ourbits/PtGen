    "introduction": "In Victoria's Empire, Britain's favourite comedienne Victoria Wood travels through the old British Empire in search of the legacy of Queen Victoria. Victoria's irreverent pilgrimage will take her to key places around the world that also share her namesake, from Fort Victoria in Ghana, to Victoria, Nova Scotia, and finishing at Zambia's Victoria Falls. Victoria's adventure will be fuelled by her fascination with the Queen Victoria - both her public and private persona. She will explore how Victoria felt about the colonisation being forged in her name and what she was like as a wife and mother. In her inimitable fashion, Victoria Wood will record her adventure tracing a nation's colourful history - blending the outrage and eccentricity with a celebration of the ordinary.",
