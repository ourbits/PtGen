Magoo, meanwhile, is making plans for his fishing trip with his friend, Ralph, over the phone. When the hound knocks at Magoo's door, Magoo mistakes the dog to be Ralph and gets his fishing gear ready although the dog is more interested in capturing the criminal then going fishing and tries to convince Mr. Magoo there is a convict hiding in his house. What's worse, when Ralph really does show up, Magoo mistakes him for the criminal!",
