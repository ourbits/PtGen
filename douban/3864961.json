    "introduction": "Although this rather lame crime story is labeled as a giallo in most books, it lacks almost everything that makes a giallo a great thriller. This film looks like a classic Agatha-Christie-like murder mystery that came about 12 years too late (would it have been made in the Mid-1960s, it would at least have gone through as a rip-off of the British Miss-Marple-mysteries starring Margaret Rutherford, although no comparable character is delivered here). The want-to-be British style crime story (almost everybody involved in the film uses English pseudonyms, director Rosati's alias being the most obvious of them all) can't convince at all, except maybe for the illustrous cast of veterans of the Italian giallo/police film genre. The only remarkable scene has Joseph Cotten's character trying to cut out his own pacemaker - which he succeeds in vain because he dies anyway (it's not as gory a scene as it sounds). All in all rather disappointing (including the final twist).",
