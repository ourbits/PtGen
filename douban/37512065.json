    "introduction": "Framed within the hyper-performative world of Instagram livestreaming, this is an impressive fresh and beautifully observed debut from actor-director Bradley Banton.In his superlative hangout film, about a group of old friends who reunite to celebrate one of their own opening a gallery show in Copenhagen, Banton manages to make the formal format of the film feel fresh, and expertly handles subtle shifts in tone and dynamic. It’s a deftly performed drama, particularly by Tuwaine Barrett, who was last seen in Hard Truths.",
