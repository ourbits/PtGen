Sometime later, he met a somewhat eccentric woman named Saki Honda and fell in love with her. But she made a suicide attempt. Rihito read her dairy, and learned that she lost her fiancée in the plane crash he escaped and she has been repeating the incident she had with her fiancée. Eventually, Rihito and Saki dropped their pretense and began to take a serious look at their own selves.",
