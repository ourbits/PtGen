The only things she remembers about herself are that she has a husband running for Attorney General and she is a geography professor with a love of cartography. Months of recovering lead her to believe she is slowly putting her perfect life back together. However, when she is approached by several strange men claiming she had contacted them to meet for sexual fantasies, she discovers a series of social media pages claiming to be her. Has her identity been stolen, or is this her former self? As she scrambles to put the pieces of her mind together, she questions who she can trust and must fight to remember the truth.",
