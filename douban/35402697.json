    "introduction": "Deep in the enchanted woods of the Moravian forest, a poacher rescues a lone little vixen and brings her home. Little does he know that as the vixen grows up, she dreams of the wonders and excitement of a life on her own. Breaking free from her human family one day, she charges into the unknown for a lifetime’s adventure!Inspired by a newspaper comic strip, The Cunning Little Vixen is one of the lighter of Janáček’s operas. While the reflection on life’s lessons speaks to adults, the work also appeals to children with its picturesque woodland setting. The opera was the highlight of the 2019 Janáček Brno International Opera and Music Festival, which won the Festival of the Year Award at the International Opera Awards the same year. With this award-winning production fresh from the National Theatre Brno, it promises to be a welcoming choice for those new to Janáček’s operas.",
