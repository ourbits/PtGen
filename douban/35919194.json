    "introduction": "(La) Fureur de Vivre is a poetic and intimate text mixed with authentic images collected during his travels, along with minimalist and original music tracks composed with Victor Pascal, editor. It is a bittersweet story on the edge of tenuous borders, object of an irreversible shift, inhabited by a fragmented and contemplative vision of nature and women. A hymn to the fragile beauty of love.",
