    "introduction": "Directors David Deal and Dave Cooper, bring you a film that celebrates one of the most historically relevant races in the world. Rare interviews with current superstars, legends of the sport, mechanics, and fans lead the audience through the brutal, unpredictable landscape that elevates Paris-Roubaix to its epic status. Director of photography Patrick Reis and his team masterfully capture the beauty of the region through stunning panoramic views and footage of the race, riders, and the infamous cobblestones which serve as the star of the film.Edited by Kathryn Hempel, the film deftly weaves rare behind-the-scenes footage, interviews, and a collection photographs—both contemporary and archival—that make Road To Roubaix an organic visual narrative that engages audiences from beginning to end. This is a rare look at Paris-Roubaix usually reserved for the sport's insiders.It is truly unique within the genre of cycling films, and will leave you anxiously awaiting Masterlink Films' next project.",
