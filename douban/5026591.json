    "introduction": "Haunted by bizarre dreams about goth rocker Trey Sylvania (Drew Seeley), with a growing lust for blood, Dylan (Lucas Grabeel) is not your average teenager-he's transforming into a vampire! It all started when he was bitten by a voracious fanged exchange student, and it's a process he is desperate to stop-but how? His demented dentist can't do anything about Dylan's aching teeth and emerging fangs, and the anti-bloodsucking pills he gets from his para-psychologist just give him a rash. Dylan is terrified and he doesn't know what to do-especially about his beautiful girlfriend Sara (Adrian Slade). Every time Dylan gets close to Sara his fangs pop out and he gets an overwhelming urge to bite her. He isn't sure how much longer he can stop himself, so he's been avoiding her and she has no idea why. Confused and hurt, Sara sings about her frustration. Dylan knows he's got to explain himself, and vocalizes his torment.",
