    "introduction": "Vietnam responds to the witty and grandiose Indonesian thriller “The Raid” (2011) astoundingly, with a lethal extravaganza of martial arts, full-capacity tension and adrenaline on trucks, boats and bikes. This spectacularly choreographed total action dynamic thriller plunges into the darkest corners of vicious revenge in gorgeous locations.Luong Đình Dũng makes a 180-degree turn from his two previous films “Father and Son” and “Drowsy City”, to deliver a jaw-droppingly breath-taking spectacle of massive fistfights, vigorous chases, sword duels, sharp wounds, and twisty traps. Non-chronological sentimental flashbacks offer shocking, gripping and plausible motivations for frantic anger, savaged fury, extreme torture, and an unchained desire to kill.Humbly honest truck driver Hung learns that the depression and paranoia of his teenage daughter An was caused by recent kidnapping and molestation. Enraged, the loving father rides to take revenge on creepy psycho paedophile millionaire who is protected by his spoilt and merciless musician son, wretched stubborn henchmen and filthy slutty female bikers. These bastards deserve gritty elimination without 50/50 or #metoo penance, sentiments, guilt or pity. There is something amazing here to witness on the big screen, and expectations for an imminent sequel are high.Vietnam nominated the film for the Oscar for the Best International Film.",
