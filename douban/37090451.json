    "introduction": "Filmmaker Alexander Kluge loves to use the expression ‘primitive diversity’ in relation to the origins of his art: the first films that were made, their genres, motives and moods. With the development of AI, Kluge asks, what could its primitive diversity look like?Thanks to technological developments, film has been through many transformations. Now, with the development of Artificial Intelligence another begins. In this new age of image-making, Young German Cinema paragon Alexander Kluge finds himself experimenting with this latest tool of image creation. Diving into a world of pictures and views whose basis is not reality itself, but mankind’s digital repository of them.",
