    "introduction": "The time has come for Eli and the Shane Gang to accompany their new friend Junjie home to the strange and beautiful Eastern Caverns. But when they arrive, they are shocked to find a world darker and more dangerous than Junjie remembers. The sinister Emperor's henchmen have pillaged every cavern of its slugs, and without the slugs' energy, the Eastern Caverns have fallen into ruins. The stolen slugs are locked away in the heart of the Emperor's evil dominion-the imperial palace. Hordes of enemies stand between the Shane Gang and the slugs, from the mindless stone warriors to the Emperor's legions of underlords to the most dangerous of all-the Dai-Fu, a fearsome slugslinger and master of Slug Fu. But Junjie is determined to rescue the slugs, save his homeland and redeem the legacy he left behind while under the Emperor's control as the Dark Slinger-and with Eli and the gang at his side, he won't have to do it alone",
