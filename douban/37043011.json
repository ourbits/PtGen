It celebrates Kline's multicultural, blended Mexican American family, and her experiences growing up as a second-generation Latina.Produced by Disney Television Animation, the original series follows Tater Ramirez Humphrey, an eccentric girl who has big dreams for her future and just one summer to figure them all out. When her mom throws a wrench in her plans by inviting all 12 of her cousins to visit, Tater braces for the worst – only to find herself having the best summer of her life. Tater and her dreams flourish, surrounded by a family who may not always understand her, but who love and support her for exactly who she is.",
