    "introduction": "Ciao Chérie tells the story of people in a Viennese call shop, of great questions of origin and borders, of the search for closeness and the need for a connection to others. Calls over big distances, remittances to the homeland, the daily routine of the shop - created in a real setting, with laymen and actors, unscripted, improvisational and with pleasure for discovery. It is a film about the possibility of the impossibility of communication between humans and disappointments, hopes and difficulties as a result. A trip around the world in the tone, one space in the image.",
