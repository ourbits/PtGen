    "introduction": "36 Husbands is a mystical, musical, Kung Fu spy comedy starring 3 powerful women - and a bunch of husbands. Krista, top spy and Kung Fu master, has extraordinary powers and she puts them in action on her quest to slow down the steady march towards World War III. Together with her Kung Fu disciples, Gina and Nola, (and Frankie, a spy on-loan from MI6) they fight and love their way across the world leaving a trail of broken hearts and sabotaged plans. All the spies and evil-doers are tuning into the Bright Blue Gorilla TV show. Why do they watch? Is it the music, is it the comedy? Maybe you can figure it out.",
