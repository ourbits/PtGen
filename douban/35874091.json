    "introduction": "Life in 17th Century Rome is anything but easy for women. They were owned and degraded by men, and not allowed to control their own lives. That is until one woman decides to take matters into her own hands with deadly consequences. This project is based on a true story about an Italian woman who was famous for selling poison to wives who wanted to murder their abusive husbands, leading to murders of over 600 men.",
