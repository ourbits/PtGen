    "introduction": "A ten-year-old boy discovers that he wants to kiss his friend, and at the same time, his father is diagnosed with HIV and his family grinds to a halt: his dad stops working, and his mother finds ways to make money by turning their house into a gym, guesthouse and sewing shop, meaning that there are always people, and they're surrounded by dancing and laughter. Six months later, they learn that the hospital had made an administrative mistake – his father won't die after all, but the good news will cause an irreparable rift in the family.",
