In one of the four episodes, a boy has been given into the care of an old woman for her to use as an assistant at the food markets. In another, a teen steals in order to escape life in the countryside. Another shows the life of a middle-aged man who lives for his rare nights out \"with the boys.\" Finally, a girl who is the despair of her parents because she has such radical views actually winds up marrying a man they approve of.",
