    "introduction": "Rabot tells the story of a social housing block on the brink of demolition. Those seeking a way out of their misery jump from the roof, those unable to find a home elsewhere, land one here. In this small, high-rise community, where indifference reigns supreme. Both building and residents must go, marking the end of a turbulent era. We follow several of the occupants during their final months in the residential tower. In a frame narrative about love, loneliness, and poverty in the heart of Western society",
