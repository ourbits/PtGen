These clones are precise and efficient, and they are genetically made without the capability to take risks.The scientist wants to prove that riskless football is a more effective way to play and a superior expression of the beautiful game. Ronaldo Fenomeno and the original players disagree, and they are willing to risk everything to prove the scientist wrong.There is only one way to know who is right: the Last Game.",
