But Marge’s life is completely upended when her beloved mother and only champion (Greer) dies in a tragic accident. With nowhere else to turn except her ultra-conservative grandparents, Marge decides instead to hunt down her estranged father (Zahn), a former soccer star living in rural Mexico as a beach bum and coach to the local women’s team. Neither is ready for such a big change, but the best shot they have at fixing their past and moving forward is together.",
