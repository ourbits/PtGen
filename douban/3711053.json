    "introduction": "It is one of the greatest Bulgarian movies I have ever seen, 18 January 2005Author: st_spirov from BulgariaIt is one of the greatest Bulgarian movies I have ever seen.The movie was made right after the falling of the communist regime in Bulgaria(and in most of the other countries) and it shows all the reality of the life of all the people except , of course , the members of the Communist Party and the crimes , outrage and violence of the people who at that time had the power in their hands and were above the law.It is a story of a boy and girl who have the same name - Margarit and Margarita.At the time when they were at school they realize that they are different - they'd like to be free to do what they want which was impossible at that time , because of the communist regime.Margarit and Margarita just can't fit in ,so they have to leave school premature , because they have only problems there.And the real life starts for them.Gradually Margarit and Margarita start to fall in love for each other.But the more their love grows stronger the more they sense the harshness of the real life...PS: I didn't expect Japanese (or anyone who know nothing about the communism or only have read about it in the books) to understand the message of the movie",
