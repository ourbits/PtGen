    "introduction": "Anni da cane is written by Mary Stella Brugiati and Alessandro Bosi, and tells the tale of Stella, a self-conscious, cynical and troubled teen with a huge imagination. After a life-changing car accident which also involves a dog, she is convinced that her life should now be counted in dog years – one being the equivalent of seven – and now that her sixteenth birthday is just around the corner, she’s actually going to be one hundred years old. For this reason, Stella believes she doesn’t have much time left to live and decides to draw up a list of all the things she wants to do before she dies. With the help of her best friends Nina and Giulio, the girl begins living her life to the max, tearing through her bucket list for fear of missing out on these experiences. But a chance encounter with Matteo, a shy and introverted boy her age, calls everything into question, turning her perspective upside down.",
