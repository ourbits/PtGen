    "introduction": "It's a lovely autumn day in Moscow as line A tram makes its last journey. This line, which runs through the old city, is no longer making enough money and is about to be closed. The old tramway is like a touring theatre. During the trip we discover a whole gallery of characters, of travellers for whom the line is like their home - the retired army officer, the young girl, the romantic young man, the old ladies... The tantrums and the taunts and the catcalls of the regular travellers are so many reflections of the hopes, the joys and the doubts of present-day Muscovites.",
