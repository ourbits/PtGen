    "introduction": "Predict My Future reveals the answers to one of life's most fundamental questions; What Makes Us Who We Are? 43 years ago a New Zealand Medical School embarked on a remarkable project - the ultimate Nature/Nurture test. They decided to follow every one of the 1,037 babies born in the city of Dunedin between April 1972 and March 1973 for their entire lives. And they have. Those children have become the 1,000 most studied people in the world. For almost four decades every aspect of their health and development has been monitored - their genes, their growth, their physical well-being, their psychology, their emotional ups and downs, criminal convictions, successes, failures - the lot. The result is the Dunedin Longitudinal Study - the broadest and the most in-depth study of human beings in the world.",
