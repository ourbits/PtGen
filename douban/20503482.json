Melvin appoints him 'Caretaker of the World... Brighton and Hove Division'. But is this Melvin really a civil servant from the future or just a mad tramp?After some haggling over a scooter, Jamie agrees to be Owen's sidekick and so their mission begins: This involves the confiscation of some homebrewed beer which, according to Melvin, will become contaminated in 2013. Curiously Melvin needs it brought to him in order to 'process' it.",
