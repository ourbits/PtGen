    "introduction": "The year is 2037. A natural disaster with global ramifications has given rise to a new America. The military is now the governing power, precious resources are scarce, and the common man struggles just to survive. We follow the story of Cara Gardner (Nicole Ann Hicks), a young woman whose family was torn apart by this new regime. Embarking on a challenging journey through war-torn America, she vows to reclaim that which has been taken from her. However, General Joseph Kellerman (Rick Montgomery Jr.), diabolic head of the newly formed UMA (United Militia of America), is hell-bent on preventing her from doing so. With all odds stacked against her, Cara labors on in search of her goal, meeting fascinating characters along the way. From 22-year-old director Conrad Faraj comes a cataclysmic tale of love and loss, bravery and determination, that will inspire, and leave you breathless.",
