    "introduction": "Max and Anna Mancini have been married for twenty-five years and have two teenage children. The two kids, even though they are twins, are completely different in personality: Tina is rebellious and not very studious; Nico is calm, solitary, and obsessed with video games. There is a constant war going on between the parents and the children, which reaches its peak on the twins' eighteenth birthday, when the party at home, which had been granted to them, gets out of hand. Max and Anna realize that they don't know anything about those two teenagers, they wonder where they went wrong and nostalgically think back to the times when Tina and Nico were adorable little ones to protect. But do they really remember how it went? At the end of that disastrous evening, a second chance presents itself for Anna and Max, to see clearly in their relationship with their children and try, where possible, not to repeat the same mistakes.",
