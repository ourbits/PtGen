    "introduction": "The format of this tripartite comedy by Carlo Verdone and also starring the Italian comic in all three leads worked so well that he did it again in 1981 with Bianco, Rosso, E Verdone. Like the second film, these three stories also take place on one day, August 15th, when Romans leave town en masse. Leo (Verdone here and in the next two leads) is a plain-looking repairman who loves to talk, is tied much too tightly to his mother's apron strings, and is trying to get out to a seaside town to visit her. In the meantime, an enchanting Spanish tourist pops into his life and he is caught between Mom and his better instincts. In the second story, Ruggero is a long-haired non-conformist entranced by a religious cult and under assault by his rational-minded father. The last story is about Enzo, a macho, narcissistic guy who plans on finding sexual adventure in Poland but then is stuck when his companion suddenly needs surgery and the only place available is a hospital along the road. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, All Movie Guide",
