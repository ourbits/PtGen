    "introduction": "At the onset of the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, 15 filmmakers from various countries across the globe who had met during Werner Herzog’s masterclass in a Peruvian jungle decided to publish phone numbers of helplines which people staying in lockdown may have used to call and share their confessions of living in isolation. Thanks to this project, an emotionally laden documentary came into life that puts into contrast images of the external desolate environment with sound recordings reflecting a wide range of feelings about existence in a voluntary prison cell. Staying isolated is not only about being locked inside but leads to a deeper understanding of oneself and one’s relations to the others.",
