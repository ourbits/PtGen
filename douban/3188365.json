    "introduction": "if Shania: A Life In Eight Albums is accurate in the details or not, since I am but a fan of Shania. To me, it depicted a pretty good version of her life, having read books and articles about her.The acting was okay, it seemed unnatural at parts which made the film awkward to watch. Especially scenes between the mother and \"teenage-Shania\". Overall, I think the whole surreal story was generally very intriguing. The actress that played Mary Bailey was great and really made her character the maternal figure that was lacking in the film.The best part I thought was the beginning, where the youngest version of Shania was singing in a bar in the middle of the night. First of all, WOW! What a talented singer! Second, it was the only acting that seemed real. Mother pressuring young country star potential to be the best she can be. And from what I've read, it was the most accurate.There were a couple undeveloped plot-lines such as when the mother left home in a rage of fury and was back in a matter of scenes sitting on the couch laughing.In my honest opinion, this film failed to compare to what Shania is now, and if I had filmed it, I would've taken a completely different approach to make the star's history as important as her present life because it's what got her where she is now. It was just really difficult to compare this to one of the greatest musicians of our generation.",
