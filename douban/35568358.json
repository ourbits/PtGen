    "introduction": "ON A SPARKLING SUMMER MORNING, reclusive master jeweller WILLIAM rushes to finish a piece for a demanding client, while in the square outside two well-dressed men, JOSH and BART, pull up in their Smart car to an odd welcome. Coloured lingerie drifts down from the sky. With quiet fury, go-getter lawyer JANET tosses these pieces out to divest herself of last night’s pain – dinner wreckage, a spectacular jewelled ring, and her lover’s belongings. Adding to Janet’s torment, her eccentric, older upstairs neighbour FELICE stirs up trouble while heading downstairs with a handbag full of cash.This all amuses Bart, who watches Felice and Janet’s antics through a gun sight while his partner-in-crime Josh psyches himself up to ‘work’. But when Felice enters William’s workshop, Josh’s plan to get William alone is shattered. He and Bart are forced to sit tight. Felice finally emerges with William, and together they head for sunlight to enjoy her new piece – an extraordinary, rose-shaped brooch made of gold and cognac diamonds. But Josh’s hopes for an easy heist are dashed even further when Felice and William run into MARLENE, who has come back desperate to apologise to Janet.For her part, Janet tries to get on with her day, but can’t resist playing with light sparkles from the William-designed ring she bought for Marlene. When Janet puts Marlene’s ring on her own finger, she decides to take Marlene’s belongings all the way downstairs. But as Janet walks out with the bags and runs straight into Marlene, she inadvertently sets off a chain of events. Before any of them can see it coming, their individual actions collide with so much force as to alter all their lives. And Josh and Bart discover their bullets are powerless when confronted with sunshine, jewels, and love.",
