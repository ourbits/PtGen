    "introduction": "All Friedrich wanted was to propose to Heidi, his supervisor, on a business trip. But while rehearsing on an airplane toilet, he and his ring drop out into the sky over the alps. Only to land in a very strange fairytale world. Come to find out, Middle Earth is right in the heart of Switzerland! To make matters worse, the quirky inhabitants mistake Friedrich for Frido the Tellyhobbie. Before he can say Tolkien, he's on a mission to save the world from an evil wizard who wants to dip the whole planet in one huge sizzling Swiss cheese fondue. A mission so crazy... it just might wake the hero in him. In the tradition of Scary Movie, THE RING THING is a spoof of the Ring Trilogy, topped off with the funny peculiarities of Switzerland.",
