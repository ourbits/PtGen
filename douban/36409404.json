    "introduction": "Overcoming self-hate, navigating the delicate balance between who they really are and their thirst for acceptance and love, a diverse group of LGBTQ youths rescued from the street have only six months! A painfully short amount of time to find a job, a place to live and a way to self-acceptance. They can’t stay any longer, the waiting lists are just too long… Struggling to stay out of trouble, estranged from his family, Alex has committed yet another petty crime and is assigned by his parole officer, to serve the community by working at the LGBTQ shelter for a month. Initially very reluctant, Alex can’t help but get attached to the damaged yet exceptional and endearing youths he encounters. Allthe shelter’s volunteers and social workers must themselves battle their own flaws and sometimes even question their motivations for helping others… Alex comes to terms with the brutal fact that they just can’t rescue everyone. But if all they can save is a single life, it’s all worth it…",
