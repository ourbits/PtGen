But is this gore-soaked siege a twisted prank, an elaborate trap, or has Night Of The Living Dead actually come to undead life? Sid Haig (The Devil's Rejects) and Courtney Gains (Children Of The Corn) star in this award-winning shocker from co-writer/director Douglas Schulze that walks the razor sharp line between edgy homage and depraved reality... then proceeds to rip its guts out.",
