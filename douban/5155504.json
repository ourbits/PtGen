    "introduction": "At a Keralite Christian wedding, a young man in the audience watches mournfully as the woman of his dreams walks down the aisle. Flashback, a young wannabe filmmaker Kartik (Simbu) moves in to the lower floor of a Keralite family, whose daughter Jessie (Trisha) he instantly falls in love with. After a few minor spurns, Kartik chases Jessie to her hometown and gradually begin a relationship. Trouble brews when her family finds out, leading to fist-cuffs and Kartik's family moving out of the home, and Jessie's father fixing her marriage with a boy within the community. The couple continue to meet, but as his filmmaking career starts to take off, there is new friction in their relationship and a drastic step from Jessie. Good music from AR Rehman, and decent performances by the entire cast, especially Kartik's boss Ganesh, who becomes an unwitting sidekick in Kartik's clandestine stalking of Jessie...
