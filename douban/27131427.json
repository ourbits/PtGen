    "introduction": "A talented young woman from a rural village travels to the \"Big City\" of Johannesburg, South Africa to become a Star. She lands a role in a musical play about Zulu Queen Mkabayi, Shaka's Aunt and searches for her identity as a Performer, a Zulu, a Woman and a Daughter. Will she be able to keep up with her more seasoned fellow performers, avoid the jealous machinations of the aging leading lady and survive the punishing rehearsal schedule to make it to opening night and shine like the star she is? \"She is King\" is a joyous celebration of Zulu culture in a glossy contemporary setting, showing off Joburg as the \"Broadway of Africa\".",
