    "introduction": "In the early dawn light, the sky is tinged with orange and pink, while housing blocks and city spires spread out below. The film will follow three stories set in a residential area, following the lives of Yves, a 30-year-old Berlin artist, Hamza, a 14-year-old deaf boy, and Déborah, a lonely basketball coach.French director Yohann Kouam is of Cameroonian descent, and his latest short film pays attention to a segment of European society that we don’t often see in cinema. The three different vignettes are deftly and elegiacally staged through documentary observations. Born in Lille, Kouam studied film editing in Belgium and translation in France, later working as a teachers’ assistant in a secondary school and teaching languages. He has returned to filmmaking in recent years.源自：https://rigaiff.lv/en/films-2023/pec-ritausmas/",
