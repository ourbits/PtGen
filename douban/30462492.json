    "introduction": "In 1990, deep in the badlands of South Dakota, paleontologists unearthed the bones of a monster. Forty feet long and weighing several tons, the fossil skeleton was assembled and rebuilt into the largest, most complete T. rex ever discovered. Named Sue, this majestic icon of the dinosaurs has captured the imaginations of millions of museum visitors over the years. But her full story has yet to be told...until now. Waking the T. rex: The Story of SUE traces the life of one of the most feared predators of the Cretaceous. Join scientists as they decipher fossil clues to piece together the lifelong struggles, from nest to death, of this famous Tyrannosaurus. Witness her life events unfold, including an epic battle with a Triceratops, in a world where the only rule is eat or be eaten.",
