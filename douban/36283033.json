That is the question filmmaker William Dickerson tries to answer in this metafictional satire about a quirky and charismatic lifestreamer. “Taylor” is an open book who magnetically draws others into his world where public and private are one and the same. But as Dickerson pushes Taylor to delve deeper into his traumatic past, the story takes an unexpectedly dangerous turn.",
