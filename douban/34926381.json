Visitors from the national registration office come to collect information from her for the census. Sarcastically naming the elderly woman \"pretty lady\", they question her about her identity - but she divulges little. However, when one of the officers stays the night to count her livestock, she opens up to him with a dramatic tale of love, sacrifice, and motherhood.",
