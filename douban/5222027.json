    "introduction": "8 year-old Patrick is left far too much on his own, due to the fact that his parents both work. The parents make it clear that they love their son, but only when they are hurrying out of the house, or have a guilty conscience. Patrick's need for tenderness is only fulfilled in his imagination. He has made a family out of a doll without any legs (Mingel), an old football (Popp) and a set of plastic animals. In his daydreams he invents a mother who is confined to a wheelchair, and is always there for him, and parents over whom he exerts a magic power. It is only when an accident happens that the adults notice his need.",
