Inspector Julia Thiel and her Polish colleague Marek investigate. The dead woman was planning to meet one of her employees to discuss a mysterious property swap. The case is a challenge for Julia Thiel, because her mother of all people is a \"legal adviser\" to the main suspect. To cap it all, her adolescent daughter is proving difficult, having found out she's having an affair with her Polish colleague.",
