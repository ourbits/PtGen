    "introduction": "In the early sixties, Hilik, a ten years old boy who lives in Tel Aviv, knows he and his brother got a goal in life - to make his parents happy and compensate for the grief and lost they had suffered in the holocaust. Moishe, Hilik's father, chooses to believe that his lost son, from his first marriage, didn't die in Auschwitz as he thought, and somehow escaped to America to become President Kennedy's assistant. As he has never really accepted the fact that he is the only survivor from his family, Moishe is sinking back to his past. Torn between his fear that his father would abandon him, and the wish to make him happy, Hilik chooses to test his father's love to him, while accepting the risk of loosing him.
