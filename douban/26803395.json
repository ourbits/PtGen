    "introduction": "PALE STAR is about the possessiveness of love. About how that possession peels back to expose power and control until we can see, in its dark heart, not love but murder. The tragedies of two couples' lives collide against the dramatic black landscapes of southern Iceland. Solveig kills her husband in a fight about his abuse of their daughter Dis. Molly, a tourist, flees the abuse of her drunken husband, Kurt. Molly arrives at Solveig's isolated house and, to begin with, is given shelter. Things begin to unravel when sickly and comatose Kurt is also brought to Solveig's. Solveig offers to help Molly with her problem husband. Molly has no idea about the direction this \"help\" is going to take. She makes a fundamental error which will lead to more deaths and, finally, to an understanding of Dis' fate.",
