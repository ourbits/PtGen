    "introduction": "On 21 September 1972, the Philippines were plunged into a dark night lasting sixteen years. On that day, President Marcos announced a state of emergency. Censorship, intimidation and distrust tarnished the days in the oldest democracy in Asia, until the dictator fled the country after the controversial elections of 1986.Leave it for tomorrow, for night has fallen is the answer Jet Leyco was given as a child when he asked about the old days. He never knew his grandparents, on either side, and the only story he knew about his mother was of her simple wedding. He reconstructs the past; a past of which he has only hazy childhood memories.",
