    "introduction": "Each year tens of thousands of Americans take their own lives, and many more have thoughts of suicide. [Facing Suicide](https://www.pbs.org/show/facing-suicide/) investigates this urgent health care challenge.Narrated by Josh Charles, the film explores the stories of Americans impacted by suicide, and journeys to the frontlines of medical and scientific research to meet some of the people who are working to curb the suicide crisis. Though suicide touches all races, genders, and socio-economic groups, the film finds that there is reason for hope: advances in research are shedding new light on risks and revealing prevention strategies that can save lives. Poignant, powerful, and timely, Facing Suicide aims to elevate and destigmatize the topic of suicide; offer an important message of hope and healing; and empower audiences and communities to help those who may be at risk.Narrator: Josh CharlesExecutive Producer: Michael RosenfeldProduction Company: Twin Cities PBS (TPT); Barrat Media; JWM Productions; 1904 Media",
