    "introduction": "When a mysterious creature stalks the night, a group of rangers employ camera traps and radio frequencies to enter this animal’s secret world.In the immense Vale do Guadiana in Portugal three rangers spend their day roaming the mountains searching for a hidden creature. Using camera traps and radio frequencies, they monitor the movements of another world that only comes out at night. With patient dedication they follow the visible signs that lead towards the invisible.The filmmaker joins this search, attuning her eyes to the minute details of huge vistas and tuning in to the smallest sounds, she sensitively tracks both the animals, and the humans on their tail.",
