    "introduction": "There is a savage beauty in the surge of a massive migration, and a strange hope that comes from witnessing it. The journey of blood-red sockeye salmon up BC’s Adams River has repeated itself for millennia and, if left uninterrupted, will do so for centuries to come. Most intriguingly, while the migration of fish takes place year after year, the astounding patterns of dense, roiling salmon never recur. In pools and back eddies along the Adams River, thousands of salmon create a dynamic and mesmerizing spectacle. It is natural and colossal. It is moving art.People locked in urban centres can easily forget that rivers in the wilderness exist—and that those forgotten rivers provide a heartbeat for humanity. Removed from the surge of migrations, the unknowing and uninformed actions of humankind can threaten to stop that wild heartbeat. Splitting the screen into multiple images, Uninterrupted brings the heart of the river into the heart of the city.",
