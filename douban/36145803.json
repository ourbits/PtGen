    "introduction": "London Underground worker Eva (55) is stuck in a rut. Her marriage has lost all passion and she begins to supplement her income by writing reviews for sex-toy start-up «The Art of Love», hoping the extra cash will fund a holiday that could rekindle the spark. Adam (34), earns his living as the face of the company, posing as main tester and Instagram's answer to Casanova. When the two are assigned a new project by their boss, Hector (60), they are less than enthusiastic about each other. But for the project to work, they need to leave their comfort zones, confront their loneliness and examine what they really want. Their newfound self-awareness comes not a moment too soon because Hector's vision has a dark side.",
