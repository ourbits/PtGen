    "introduction": "Fromhttp://danielsousa.com/A short film based on a childhood memory. As a child, I would run to this abandoned windmill whenever I wanted to be alone. It stood at the edge of the woods and in my mind it demarcated the boundary between civilization and a more primal, spiritual realm. This started as a study for Feral, but evolved into its own project. However, The notion of the windmill as a talismanic portal remained in the final film.",
