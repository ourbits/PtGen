    "introduction": "London-based Slovak director Denis Dobrovoda, who shot projects for ITV2 and Channel4, is finishing an intriguing documentary titled The Cathedral and centred on a monk who single handedly built a cathedral. Dobrovoda worked on the stranger-than-fiction story of Justo Gallego, a former monk who spent decades building a church out of recycled materials on the outskirts of Madrid. The director spent the last four years of Justo’s life (who died in November 2021 at the age of 96) filming him as he continued to work and explained his opinions about religion and the edifice’s future. The director will also use never-before-seen archival footage capturing the process of building the DIY cathedral, and Steadicam and drone shots mapping the spatial splendour of the edifice. The film is almost completed, with the sound mix and colour grading being finalised.",
