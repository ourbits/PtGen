The mother is greatly disappointed and Irene wants ot take revenge. After an intentional fire, Rafael becomes blind and his wife prays to the indian saint Ceferino Namuncurá to protect him. The miracle happens and Rafael recovers his sight.Born August 26, 1886, Ceferino Namuncura was the son of legendary Mapuche chief Manuel Namuncura who, after years of fighting the military and white encroachment surrendered on the advice of a Salesian monk who baptized his son when he was eight. Ceferino studied at a religious school in Buenos Aires, \"so he could be of service to his race\" according to historians, and as a priest became renown for his unswerving faith. He was presented to then Pope Pius X in Rome in 1904, but succumbed to tuberculosis a year later. His remains were taken back to Argentina in 1924 and laid to rest in Buenos Aires.",
