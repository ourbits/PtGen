    "introduction": "A chain of 10 000 images found through Google’s reverse image search. The visual development is based on the misunderstandings that happen in the AI’s reading of the image material. The AI doesn’t care about scale, emotions or context but is only interested in patterns, colours and correlations. We are watching a primal chaos before the creation of an artificial consciousness. And the awakening consciousness is looking back at us as a species.",
