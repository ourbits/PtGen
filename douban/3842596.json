    "introduction": "This is the final part in the Tough Guy or Bad Reputation series that starred Shintaro Katsu as Asakichi (sort of like a early 20th century yakuza non-blind Zatoichi).  The series ran for sixteen films, with a number of famous Japanese directors (Tanaka, Makino, Mori) and you can read more about it here: linkI'm fairly certain the DVDr I sourced for this was taped off of Hawaiian television at some point (it has that \"look\") and hopefully it will be released officially on DVD somewhere and these subtitles can be added to it (the rest of the series is available on DVD in Japan, but not this one.)  The video quality *obviously* leaves much to be desired, but I noticed that there was a lot of Masumura activity on KG so this might be of interest.A quick summary by dbborroughs from imdb:Quote:Set in 1937, this is the story of Asakichi, who is played by Shiuntaro Katsu, best known as being Zatoichi in 26 films. Asakichi has been disowned by his father for gambling, so he heads off to make his living in cockfighting. He, in quick order, wins some money, takes up with a fallen geisha and quickly comes in conflict with the yakuza. Besting their top man, Asakichi, is drawn into the life of a yakuza despite his efforts to remain outside of it.",
