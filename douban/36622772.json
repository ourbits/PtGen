    "introduction": "A film by Mario Colucci, shot in 1972 but never released due to production disagreements involving the performers, Philippe Leroy and Catherine Spaak; it is a \"touristic\" noir with interesting decadent atmospheres.The film tells, in a curious narrative structure of flashbacks and hypotheses, the true story of a giallo that took place in Taormina in the mid-1950s, the drowning of a female tourist on a boat trip off Isola Bella with her husband; the facts lead back to a fortuitous fall into the water but the man is accused of murder and put on a pressing trial.While watching, it is impossible not to be caught by the fascination of the lost and found work, the ruined tape, the colors altered by time; in addition, the film displays a succession of interlocking events between present and past that succeeds in capturing the attention, scattering a series of clues that are now deceptive and now revealing.Certainly, there is no shortage of strengths, but that does not detract from the fact that \"L'altro piatto della bilancia\" remains a deeply dated film in form, an exponent of a 'genre' season for Italian cinema in which the pace was slow, the dialogue enigmatic, the direction tragically static. Colucci's work, a director who lost track of himself rather early on, is no exception.This copy is from the master used for the screening at TaoFilmFest 2012, the Taormina Film Festival, the first (and last) occasion in which the film was shown to the public.",
