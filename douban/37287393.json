    "introduction": "A murder in the middle of the mountains, an aboriginal amulet with magical powers and two people desperate to make up for lost time.Darío Mascambroni takes a new step forward: refining his style, producing brief flashes of unexpected truth -a trademark of his cinema, but also what we could call a politics-, his new film is no stranger to masterfully executed forms of realism, to which he adds almost supernatural elements with regal pertinence. The Wish works as a plea, a dream, an invocation. Straddling a suspense typical of modern cinema -underground, with the caution of someone walking through a minefield-, the film is careful not to take everything for granted and, instead, offers a reflection on its own existence. The director seems to have found a key for cinema to recover its ability to ask questions.",
