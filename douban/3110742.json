    "introduction": "This short brings to life the tall tale of giant lumberjack Paul Bunyan and his large blue ox Babe. It presents Bunyan's shore-side discovery as a baby, his small town youth, his tree-cutting journeys out west, and his standoff with the diminutive Joe Muffaw with his steam-powered saw. This is one of the better narrative cartoons of the set, though environmentalists may disapprove.",
