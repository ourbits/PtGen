    "introduction": "Kazimierz Karabasz's documentary depicts the daily, arduous work of the youngest adepts of a music school. We watch classes in rhythmics, note transcription, ballet, singing and (still shy) playing instruments. The camera carefully captures the children's concentration and dedication, with the only commentary being the teachers' endless instructions coming from behind the frame: \"slower, more precise, higher hands...\". As the director himself said in his book Chełmska 21: 50 years of the Documentary and Feature Film Studio in Warsaw:\"[The work of a documentary filmmaker consists of] looking for the small elements that make up - immodestly speaking - the truth about a person. By carefully observing and collecting the details of which life is made up, one is able to capture such truth.\"",
