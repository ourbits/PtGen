    "introduction": "The film opens with Karl Davis (Hannah) waking in a wrecked hotel room with no memory of what’s happened, where he is, or even who he is. When he discovers a dead body in the bathtub, and two police officers soon knock at his door, it sets into motion a terrifying and explosive series of events that force Karl and hotel maid Molly on a blind descent into a deceptive world of confusion and conspiracy and at the same time with a price on his head and half the city in murderous pursuit. Karl will need to draw on his forgotten skill sets if he has any hope of survival as he and Molly endeavor to unravel the mystery that took his memories.",
