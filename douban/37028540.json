    "introduction": "All Tina’s ever wanted is a friend, but, due to cancer, her parents, Andrey and Tatyana, hide her from the world. A nosebleed prompts her to seek her parents’ help, and they put Tina to bed.  Tatiana hopes that sleep and her home remedies will help conserve Tina’s strength, but Boris isn’t convinced. He wants to take her to a hospital. That night, Tina slips into a coma induced fever dream and meets Myphos, a quirky white Satyr that lives in the Forest around the family cottage. He lures her into the fantastical world alive and well in the Forest. Slowly, Tina regains her strength and, once again, feels like a normal girl with a friend. Unfortunately, Myphos is the King of Hell. Upon that realization, Tina tries her best to escape the hellish Forest and gets trapped in the roots of a tree, while Myphos hunts her down. She calls out to her parents and their voices answer. She fights with Myphos as she follows the voices and escapes Hell. Afterward, she wakes in a hospital, with her parents, forever changed.",
