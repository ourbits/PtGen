    "introduction": "Lord Don't Slow Me Down is a rockumentary film, looking back on British band Oasis' Don't Believe the Truth world tour which took place from May 2005 to March 2006. The film is directed by Baillie Walsh.A handful of fans-only private screenings took place around the world with the world premiere of the film at the Directors Guild Theater in New York City on November 4, 2006 as part of the CMJ Film Festival. The UK television premiere was on Channel 4 on November 19, at 11:50pm, although it was a heavily edited version with approximately 40 minutes cut from the original 95 minute version. The film was unveiled to coincide with Oasis' best-of album \"Stop the Clocks\", released on November 20, 2006. A preview of the film was included on the Let There Be Love DVD single, released in November 2005.The film features a new Oasis song also called \"Lord Don't Slow Me Down\", written by Noel Gallagher and recorded during the Don't Believe the Truth sessions, Gallagher described it as being \"one of the best things, like The Who, The Yardbirds and the Jeff Beck Group combined, and it's got two drum solos on it!\". He has also said that his girlfriend thought it was the only Oasis song you could dance to. The song was left off 'Don't Believe the Truth' because Gallagher felt that including it would have meant he'd have been singing too many songs on the record.",
