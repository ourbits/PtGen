    "introduction": "And I was so surprised at how well Joseph Conrad works in a MexicCity setting. I noticed that there were no comments on this movie so far, and, since I liked it a lot when I saw it around 15 years ago (it's 2006 now)I want to draw people's attention to it. I can't go into much detail about it after that long a time. It's an understated but fascinating story of the relationship between the two women (the mother of the guy who ran off to sea years earlier and has never come back) and her co-worker in a large office. The younger woman becomes interested, even romantically, in him just from hearing about him, and you, the audience, do, too. Then when he suddenly appears one day, both she and you are in for having your romantic illusions shattered. I was very struck by the last visuals, involving scenes from the ocean, apparently invading a Mexico City apartment. I found on the web that the English title was Shipwreck (though I don't recall that title), and that it was based on Conrad's short story: Tomorrow, which I must try to find and read. I hope my comments will inspire others to find this affecting \"little\" movie. Note to IMDb: Could \"Shipwrecked\" be added as an alternative title, or cross reference?",
