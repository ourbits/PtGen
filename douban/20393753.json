Travel back in time to when it first started with appearances from John Bishop, Emma Bunton, Dermot O’Leary, Davina McCall, Paddy McGuiness and my 2 Irish offspring Jedward POTATO! With 'nuff unseen stuff that was never aired cos I said things I shouldn't, outakes, and all those other extra fings you get on a DVD which stands for Digital Versatile Disc. Laugh until ya stop. Mot, mot, mot. All't best, Keith Lemon.",
