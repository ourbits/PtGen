    "introduction": "My Way is much more than a song; this major score has crossed eras, borders and generations. It’s an anthem that has become part of us and a permanent part of music history.My Way is also one of the most covered songs ever, from Sid Vicious to Tom Jones, not to mention Nina Simone or Pavarotti.However, many people are unaware that it was initially conceived in France, by the pool of Claude François’ mansion on a summer afternoon in 1967, and that a succession of fortuitous meetings and sleepless nights had guided her across the Atlantic towards the man who would make her a Legend.In a form of a biopic, the documentary MY WAY tells the story of the genesis of a mythical song and how it became part of the Hall of fame.",
