    "introduction": "Since his childhood, Takahiro has been gifted with a very strong sixth sense, allowing him to have flash precognition, and sometimes, when feeling under extreme anxiety, he finds himself using psychic powers unconsciously. In fact, this immeasurable power comes from his ancestor, the legendary Heian period sorcerer, Ashiya Doman. Takahiro spent years successfully controlling the mystical gift running through his veins, but the death of his mother will eventually be the final nail out from the coffin in which he tried to bury his real self, as her last will is having him recite a passage from a very old spell book: The Hoki Naiden.",
