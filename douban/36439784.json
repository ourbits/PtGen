    "introduction": "Presented inside an earth-lined burrow, Burrow Me invites us to take part in the story of the inhabitant of an underground lair, built into the Lighthouse space. A small tunnel leads to a screening space, the home of Eva’s child (Eva is a previous character from one of Prouvost’s films); he is the builder of this soily burrow. He tells us his fantastic story using conflicting dialogue , disturbing the meaning of spoken words, subtitles and images.
