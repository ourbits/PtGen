Jack Shepherd, 28, met Charlotte Brown, 24 for the first and only time on December 8th, 2015. Jack wined and dined Charlotte at the Shard before offering her a ride on his speedboat on the Thames. Hours later, Charlotte's body was lifted from the water. A post-mortem ruled she died from cold water immersion. Jack Shepherd was unharmed.",
