    "introduction": "Hailee Anderson (AnnaLynne McCord), the famous talk show host, is preparing for the holiday season by working; she's planning her very important TV show, her Christmas special. Already a scrooge, Hailee is even more miserable when she finds out her real-estate fiancée Jason (Drew Scott) is cheating on her - on air. To clear her head, she goes on a drive and ends up in Carver Bend, Connecticut, unfortunately crashing through a local judge's fence. Forced to do community service, she helps out her rescuer Logan (Jefferson Brown), by building a float for the town's annual Christmas parade to help save the town's art center. While Hailee bonds with the locals, the art center kids, and grows closer to Logan, she re-learns why the holidays are important to spend with",
