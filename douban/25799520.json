    "introduction": "Mist's sheepdog adventures continue, and are more exciting than ever. Together with her friends, Mist lends a helpful paw to an orphaned lamb, a homeless ram, a clumsy duck, a confused alpaca, a brood of fluffy ducklings and a lost eagle. With a host of new characters, and returning favourites, Mist, Jake, Eddie and the gang prove that a dog's life is never dull. In 'Little Orphan Aggie' a tiny orphan lamb is rescued by Mist and Ernie. Old Swift jumps at the chance to mother him back to strength - but will she be ready to say goodbye when he goes back to the pastures?",
