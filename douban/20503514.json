    "introduction": "i.will.know.you” presents a visceral portrait of a chronic philanderer named Momo whose self-sabotage knows no limits. The film examines multiple aspects of his psyche, from his childhood in Communist Romania to modern day New York City.Momo lost something incredibly dear to him - his best friend. His is the identity of binary knowledge – he is displaced from a cultural lieux that both accepts and rejects him (Romania) and at the same time he is removed from life itself. It all starts at one point – the loss of his best friend – hence comes his desire to have known his best friend better while he was still alive.\"I like noodles. I like women. I'll leave you when you need me the most. I am Momo.\"",
