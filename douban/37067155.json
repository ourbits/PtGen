    "introduction": "Onboard the Panerai container ship, a teenage crew must navigate the awkward space between the innocence of adolescence and the responsibilities of adulthood, as they travel through Europe's vast industrial ports and terminals. Stranded at sea, they grapple with the uncertainties of their future while wrestling with the emotional and personal challenges of growing up.Filmed over four years, “Freight” is a nuanced masterpiece that blends striking cinematography with the haunting soundscape of the ship’s groaning hull and clanging metal containers. The result is a deeply atmospheric cinematic experience.",
