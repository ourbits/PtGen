    "introduction": "Jens Brandt works long night and weekend shifts as a taxi driver. His wife, Constanze Brandt, is working hard to get a permanent job as an architect at her current place of work. As a result, the couple practically only sees each other in the taxi when Jens gives Constanze a ride home. When they find out that their son Luis is being bullied at school, stress levels threaten to escalate. Their different ideas about how to help Luis turn the taxi into a conflict zone. ES GEHT UM LUIS is an emotional and entertaining ride into the unknown. 'A gripping chamber play in a Taxi where only red lights allow for catching one's breath.' – Valeria Wagner",
