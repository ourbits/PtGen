    "introduction": "It’s hard to be honest in a dishonest world. Sotiris has almost given up. Luckily he still has his work as a cop, which provides a modest opportunity to fight the system. A fabulous, melancholy comedy with unmistakeable Kaurismäki and Tati influences.Sotiris is a policeman nearing retirement. His work consists of interrogating suspects. One day, he decides he only wants to be just - a decision which means all his interviewees are let off and which leads him to make a fatal mistake during a corruption hearing.Dora, an opportunistic cleaning lady, who just like everyone else is desperately trying to keep her head above water in a bankrupt country, is the only person who can help him. The tired policeman trusts her and they even seem to be falling in love. However, time and again, Sotiris' desire for and faith in honesty is invalidated.Filippos Tsitos’ follow-up to Plato’s Academy, in which Antonis Kafetzopoulos also played the lead, is another Greek-German co-production. The phlegmatic characters, the deadpan humour and the stylised, minimalist scenes are reminiscent of both the work of Aki Kaurismäki and Jacques Tati as well as that of Tsitos’ countryman Yorgos Lanthimos (Dogtooth).",
