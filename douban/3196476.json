    "introduction": "Hosted by reigning daytime TV queen Fern Britton, 50 Ways To Leave Your TV Lover is a cheeky countdown celebrating the small screen's most memorable splits.Compulsive viewing, the irreverent one-off special recounts soap separation shockers, real-life heartbreak headline-grabbers and dastardly dumping methods from the biggest serial dramas. With so many to choose from, competition for the top spot will be fierce.Hot contenders will surely include the EastEnders episode where domestic violence victim Little Mo finds the courage to fight back. After years of abuse and degradation, the mouse-like character decides enough is enough, bludgeoning terrifying Trevor with an iron. To the cheers of the country, Mo gave the Scot his just desserts.How about MP Lembit Opik giving weather presenter Sian Lloyd the cold shower to date a Cheeky Girl? No one could have forecast that bizarre pairing. Finally, in girlie favourite Sex And The City, Carrie's buttons are pushed when her latest lover avoids a face-to-face confrontation by cooling their relationship by Post-it note.",
