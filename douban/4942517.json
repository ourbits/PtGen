    "introduction": "This inspired comedic series goes behind-the-scenes of a Hollywood production when talented Allison \"Sonny\" Munroe makes the leap from the Midwest to Los Angeles to join the cast of \"So Random!,\" the most popular sketch comedy TV show for kids and tweens. Her fellow young actors are resident teen queen Tawni, super suave Nico, gregarious funnyman Grady and quirky Zora. Now Sonny must somehow balance these new friendships while adjusting to her family's decidedly different way of life in Hollywood. Meanwhile, Sonny must also contend with heartthrob Chad Dylan Cooper, star of the rival show \"MacKenzie Falls,\" who makes it known that he thinks his dramatic work is better than her comedy career.迪士尼频道2009年首播的系列情景喜剧《Sonny With a Chance》，由曾主演《Camp Rock》的人气童星Demi Lovato担当主演。剧中，Demi扮演的Allison \"Sonny\" Munroe，本是威斯康辛州的一个普通女孩，她通过互联网视频让热播喜剧“So Random!”的执行制片注意到了她，并邀其前往好莱坞加入电视剧的拍摄。摄影棚里的生活并不像Sonny想象的那样顺利，但在一个个滑稽幽默的磕磕绊绊中，Sonny逐渐成为电视明星，实现了自己的梦想。",
