    "introduction": "Shot in London with a Cannon 5D in 11 days, The Silver Goat is a must-see for anyone interested in independent filmmaking--a story about comfort spaces, nepotism, power struggles and the questions around what is at stake in the artistic world--featuring Alexa Brown as Lydia Brass, an actress and daughter of world-renowned playwright, Sir Rowland Brass (Don McCorkindale), who has decided to leave the acting world behind until she develops a relationship with an ambitious American playwright living in London (Tom Colley). After she marries him, he gradually coerces her back on stage where she finds herself caught in a psychological game between her father and husband. a writer who is a plain old nobody, or no one altogether.Written by Anonymous",
