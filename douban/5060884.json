    "introduction": "Best known in the U.S. for 1975's Lies My Father told Me, Jan Kadar once again teams with Elmar Klos to direct this somewhat downbeat story about the people who live in an apartment house in a suburb of Prague. As in most big cities, the residents manage to live side-by-side without knowing very much about each other at all. In one apartment, a young woman enters into an affair and when she gets pregnant, her eyes are opened to her lover's intentions and character -- he wants her to get an abortion. In another apartment, a lonely nurse misses her husband who happens to be in jail, and does not know what to do when an insistant suitor will not leave her alone. There is a third story about a small child with an alcoholic father, but the import of the message changes slightly when the nurse and the pregnant young woman get together and manage to enjoy each other's company -- the anonymity of city life is dented a little. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi",
