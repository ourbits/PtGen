    "introduction": "After putting in a hard day's work, a man, who bears a striking resemblance to the characters of David Lynch's DumbLand (2002), and even hapless Alan from The Adventures of Alan R. (2020), arrives home. As all sweet husbands and wives do, his doting wife asks him about his day. \"How was your day, honey?\" asks him every evening, to receive the usual reply: \"Oh, you know. It was really busy\". But, over the years, this seemingly innocuous phrase has turned into an earworm--a thought that's stuck in his head, and now, he can't get it out. Perhaps, in the grand scheme of things, this is what life looks like. An endless cycle of repetition and randomness until we die. So, how was your day, honey?",
