    "introduction": "Body Collage is a visceral \"movement-event\" from 1967, in which Schneemann paints her body with wallpaper paste and molasses, and then runs, leaps, falls into and rolls through shreds of white printer's paper, creating a physicalized corporal collage. \"My intention was not simply to collage my body (as an object), but to enact movement so that the collage image would be active, found, not predetermined or posed,\" writes Schneemann.",
