During their last night, the fathers of the Archconfraternity of San Giovanni Decollato aim to make them renounce their Jewish faith and convert to Catholicism.Confortorio is a lofty example of the potential of a cinema that is poor (and at the same time rich in expressive results) and independent, that is, not subservient to any “primary dependence”; a cinema made with little money but founded on research, documentation, and invention.",
