They do this in order to escape from the monotony of life in a village. Each of the character will try, at the same time, to make a transition toward teenage maturity. As for Frisson, a young boy who recently lost his father, his dream is to go to Woodstock in order to attend to a concert. In fact, because he wants to get the autograph of Jimi Hendrix, his idol, Frisson will try to find the money for the trip.",
