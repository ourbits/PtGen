    "introduction": "改编自19世纪英国小说家斯蒂文森的《自杀俱乐部》。The title of this Chilean horror drama translates literally as The Lady of Death. Though filmed largely in Santiago, the production personnel, including director Carlos Hugo Christensen, were brought in from Argentina. The title character, played by Judith Sulian, is a member of a strange club which arranges the \"voluntary\" suicides of its members. Falling in love with the heroine, Carlos Cores strives to save her from herself, even if it costs him his own life. La Dama de la Muerte was based on Robert Louis Stevenson's The Suicide Club, previously film in the U.S. as Trouble for Two (1936).",
