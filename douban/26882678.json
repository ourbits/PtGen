Dupui keeps tight control over the town through a gang called the Yellow Jackets, hand-picked by Dupui and under his control through the use of a drug which he calls 'Possession.' As the forces of good close in on the mayor and his evil gang, events start to spiral out of control and an ancient force of evil is released.",
