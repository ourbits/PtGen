    "introduction": "Made in two parts that mirror each other in form and content, Prologue: Squat/Anti-Squat (2016) sheds light on a squatting action in the Bijlmer district in 1970’s Amsterdam by a group of Dutch Caribbean activists, juxtaposing it with two recent episodes of occupation. In a condensed two-day shoot the film brings together over a dozen individuals from different generations with various backgrounds.",
