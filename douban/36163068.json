    "introduction": "A portrait of a working man - Stefan Piętowski, a craftsman who, at the age of 85, sums up his professional life. In order to do so, he organizes \"The History of One Working Life\" exhibition. It dates back to the pre-war years at Wytwórnia Precyzyjno-Mechaniczna (Precise Machinery Company), the war period, and the post-war years. The protagonist was responsible for, among other things, inventing new machines, e.g. the ones used in the production of cigarettes. His will to live and sense of humor were not changed even by his imprisonment during the Stalinist period. After leaving prison, he reactivated the Company and constructed a multi-functional can/bottle opener, which became our export product. Piętowski embodies the ethos of a craftsman. With enthusiasm, intelligence, and vital energy, he demands his rightful place in society. In a nutshell - \"Work is my vocation, passion, and addiction\".",
