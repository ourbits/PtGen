    "introduction": "Giorgi Shengelaya makes his one of the best film \"Pirosmani\", which visual world is fully soaked with the soul of masterpieces of well-known primitivist painter N. Pirosmanashvili. At the same time Giorgi Shengelaya is a cinematographer, who successfully works in genre cinema. On his account are western adventure films \"Matsi Khvitia\", \"Khareba da Gogia\" (Khareba and Gogia), one of the best Georgian musical \"Veris Ubnis Melodiebi\" (Melodies of Vera Quarter) and also the parable from the Georgian history of the XIX century \"Akhalgazrda kompozitoris Mogzauroba\" (Trip ofYoung Composer).The son of director Nikolai Shengelaya, Giorgi, along with his brother Eldar, were part of the sixties generation of Soviet filmmakers. Shengalaya graduated from the Moscow State Institute of Cinematography in 1963, and made his debut in 1967 with He Did Not Want To Kill, focusing, like many of his films, on Georgian subjects and settings. His 1969 film, Pirosmani, could be considered his greatest and most representative film, concerned as it is with ordinary life and extraordinary art, independence and belonging-- conditions that mirrored Shengalaya's perception of life in the Soviet republics.",
