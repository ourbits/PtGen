    "introduction": "Baritone saxophonist Gerry Mulligan was exceptional. He was an arranger, composer, lyricist, singer, conductor, pianist, jazz-movement transformer, educator, a bandleader and an actor. Shortly after Mulligan's death in 1996, director Thor Raxlen released Listen: Gerry Mulligan, a documentary sponsored by the Library of Congress and produced by Mulligan's wife, Franca Rota Mulligan. It runs about an hour and a half and looks at Mulligan's contribution to jazz and his love for life and music.",
