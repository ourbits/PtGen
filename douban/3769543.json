    "introduction": "影片《古拉埃尔》（Gulaal）好像是类似《蓝色粉末》、《我呼吸的空气》、《通天塔》之类的片子...许多个小故事最终被导演 阿努拉格·卡施亚普 巧妙地编排成一个出人意料的结局，包括学生政治活动，分裂的拉其普特，爱情故事，等等...Accuse him of thinking abstract, but you cannot accuse Anurag Kashyap of following the stereotype. In Gulaal, the storyteller attempts to tell multiple stories in one film. Student politics, a separate state for Rajputs, an intense love story that has a disastrous end… Kashyap's Gulaal is intelligent, intense, disturbing, poignant and expectedly, cerebral.Gulaal is thought-provoking and has the power to engage you at various points of the narrative. Honestly, it takes time to get the hang of things. Actually, you don't take to the sundry characters and the relationships instantly, but the complex relationships, their motives, the culmination, each layer is peeled as the story progresses.",
