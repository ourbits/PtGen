His father, himself an officer in the gendarmerie, wants it that way. When Jan hears about the CDI, a new unit that will tackle drug criminals using American methods, he immediately puts himself forward as a candidate. They don't wear uniforms at the CDI, so he can continue to parade around the courtyard of the barracks in his fashionable outfits.",
