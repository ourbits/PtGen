    "introduction": "Sherlock Holmes in investigates the strange case of Jabez Wilson. The man was recently offered employment by an organization known as the Red Headed League. For the grand sum of 4 pounds per week, he was to sit in an office and copy out entries fro an encyclopedia, starting with the letter A. He had responded to an advertisement and while there were many applicants, he has no idea why he was selected as the League's beneficiary. When after several weeks his employment is suddenly terminated, Mr. Wilson doesn't know what think. Holmes quickly deduces however that it was the location of his office as much as his red hair that resulted in him getting the employment in the first place. Written by garykmcd",
