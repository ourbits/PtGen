    "introduction": "Cowboys of Culture is director Geoff Steven's personal perspective on the Kiwi cinema renaissance of the 1970s. It traces the development of the local film industry from the ‘she'll be right' days when filming permits were unknown, and all that was needed to get a picture up were a Bolex camera, enthusiasm and ingenuity. Raw they might have been, but the films (Wild Man, Sleeping Dogs, Goodbye Pork Pie, Smash Palace) represented a vital new cultural force. The film features interviews with the major players, and clips from their movies.The thing that was maybe unique about that particular film [Pork Pie] is that it was made by an extended family, and there were kids everywhere. That was fortunate for me, because as my character went along I used to watch the kids and copy them and do all the yahoo stuff. – Kelly Johnson on Goodbye Pork Pie",
