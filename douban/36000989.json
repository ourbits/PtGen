    "introduction": "Cameron Mackintosh is the most prolific, successful and famous musical theatre producer in the world today. This film will be his personal story, told in his own words, and those of the writers, actors, directors, technicians, musicians, colleagues and family who share their stories of working with him over the past 50 years. Rare archive and private videos will give a never- before-seen glimpse into the life of this amazing man, exploring how his passion and instinct, along with an obsessive attention to detail, has brought him acclaim and success like few others. As he hits the milestone age of 75 and celebrates 50 years of bringing us iconic theatre such as Les Miserables, Miss Saigon, Phantom of the Opera, Hamilton, it will be obvious that he is not slowing down and is as passionate about the theatre as ever.",
