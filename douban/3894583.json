Yet within this singular religious community there are profound differences in attitudes about peace, violence, punishment, forgiveness, and the status of women.This eye-opening film goes deep into the heart of the Muslim world to explore the history and current state of Islam. It also delves into the personal lives of its subjects, who range from ayatollahs and grand imams to simple farmers and women living in veiled seclusion; their relationship with this holy Book reveals a complex, beautiful and often contradictory guide for humanity.",
