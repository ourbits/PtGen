    "introduction": "For a seasoned filmmaker focusing on another creature than man is a pleasure. A creature who don't give a shit about the meaning of life while in the background, blurred, all the turmoil of man is still there, the warmongering, the pretentiousness, the eagerness to please. My protagonists are beautiful lovers, arrogant killers, serious sleepers and if you caress them they will scratch you right away or love you shortly before they kill you. And nobody plays the grand piano better than a cat who couldn't care less about harmony walking down a dilapidated keyboard in Riga, Latvia.",
