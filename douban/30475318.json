    "introduction": "库尔特·诺尔博士是20世纪30年代上海的一名医生，他热衷于拍摄1600万部家庭电影。他的女儿把他的旅行和家庭录像拼凑在一起，从乘坐豪华远洋客轮到在埃及骑骆驼，在印度看到法基尔人，还有他的小女儿在花园里嬉戏。一次又一次，狩猎和战利品的场景。再加上他女儿拍摄的彩色片段，这就成了与导演的对话——“电影的概念是让父亲的片段说话，这样就可以向女儿揭示它的意义”。Dr Kurt Noll, a doctor in Shanghai in the 1930s, was passionate about shooting 16mm home movies. His daughter has put together a montage of his travel and family footage, ranging from passage on a luxury ocean liner to riding camels in Egypt, seeing fakirs in India, and his young daughter romping in the garden. And over and over again, scenes of hunting and trophies. Combined with colour footage shot by his daughter, it becomes a dialogue with the director – „the concept of the film was to make the father’s footage speak, so it would reveal its meaning to the daughter“.",
