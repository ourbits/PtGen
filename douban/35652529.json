    "introduction": "The film documents the life of one of the oldest and largest European markets. Passion on both sides of the counter, loaders’ dreams, hidden fantasies of fish sellers… Security guards and flea market manager share their thoughts about the universe and the meaning of life. The past, the present, the future, and other gypsy predictions, “the most correct weight” and generous portions on trial. There are all the kinds of town folks at the Pryvoz. They are exposed and revealed! Everybody comes here, and everyone finds something to him/herself. Someone who searches for miracles or metamorphoses – in destiny, human soul, and time – also would not go out of there with empty hands.",
