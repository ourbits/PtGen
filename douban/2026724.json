    "introduction": "Michael J. Saul's collection of seven short love stories explores the ups and downs of gay relationships in the 21st century.From a father confronting his homosexual son to a tender Sunday morning conversation between lovers and on to a frisky couple who can't get through dinner without sneaking away for a quickie, the collection runs the gamut of emotions and situations.John Ainsworth, Michael Bierman, Rachel Cohen and Michael James star.Each short represents a snap shot of gay life; growing up, growing old, and falling in & out of love. Although, the title \"True Love\" may not fully speak for the wide spectrum of perspectives in gay life shown in the 7 shorts, it does represent what each short's character was trying to find. Kudos especially to the shorts \"History\" and \"He Was Perfect\". Both well written, directed, and performed. If you are looking for shorts with gratuitous nudity or sex, this is not the film to check out.But if you are looking for a film that explores an array of gay issues without being an After-school special, this is the film for you. Michael Saul is definitely one to watch over the coming years.",
