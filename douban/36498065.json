    "introduction": "Open City Documentary Festival 2023In this reflexive work of autobiography, Susana Blaustein Muñoz asks friends and family members to speak about her and weaves their testimonies together with her own responses and an array of filmic and photographic materials. Through this chorus of conflicting perspectives, a fragmentary picture of Susana as a lesbian artist who has left her traditional family in Argentina to live abroad takes shape. According to film critic Beatrice Loayza, the filmmaker “creates a portrait of herself as viewed by other women. The question becomes not whether these women are able to hit the bull’s-eye on who exactly Susana is; it is about exploring the different sources from which identity can be constructed.”",
