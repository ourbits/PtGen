    "introduction": "Greener Mountains is the coming of age story of JP Barton, an adopted boy raised on a throwback Vermont family resort. Since being found as an infant by the mercurial aging owner, JP has essentially never left the resort grounds. But with the arrival of a young, free spirited New York artist, Alice Flynn, his sheltered life is suddenly turned upside down. Her arrival, plus a convergence of events, propels JP on a bumpy ride of self-discovery. It's not until JP accepts who he is, that he realizes what's most important to him. As a result he is finally able to win Alice and in the process save the resort. Greener Mountains is a story of finding out where you belong in the world and discovering that who you are is often more than enough. Greener Mountains is a family friendly, coming-of-age story about finding your place in the world.",
