    "introduction": "Bambule, Ulrike Meinhof's television play, was published in script form in 1971, while Meinhof was still on the run. The publishing house of Klaus Wagenbach, which had been an unwitting partner in the ruse to free Andreas Baader from prison custody in May of 1970, published \"Bambule.\"Bambule was the TV movie that Ulrike Meinhof had written about a group of girls rioting in their youth home. It was scheduled to air on Sunday, 24 May, at 8:15 PM. But Meinhof had helped free Andreas Baader from prison custody two weeks earlier, and Bambule never aired. It was eventually aired on German TV in 1997. The script was published in book form in 1971.",
