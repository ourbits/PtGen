    "introduction": "Long before Taylor Swift swooned over Tim McGraw, before Celine Dion's heart went on and even before Patsy Cline was crazy for feeling so lonely, Patti Page was waltzing her way into music history. Still among the top selling artists of all time (with over 100 Million record sales) her pristine vocals propelled this small town country girl from Oklahoma into International Superstardom in the late 1940's with 111 charting singles. She became the first Country crossover artist who became a pop sensation and not only helped country music become more mainstream, but also blazed a path for women of all genres for the future. This is her story as never before told.",
