The series focuses on five teams of 8-9 year old Texas (American) football players, their families and their coaches. The series has garnered quite a lot of attention for revealing the abusive behavior of several of the coaches, resulting in these coaches being suspended from their duties.This is the show's description from the producers:In America, football is king… and nowhere is football bigger than in Texas. With exclusive access to the 8 to 9 year-old Rookies division of the Texas Youth Football Association, this 10-part docuseries follows five teams on and off the field during the 2013 season. Throughout, coaches and parents offer insight into why they believe they’re teaching valuable lessons about discipline and dedication, but also grapple with serious questions about parenting, safety and at what price we're pushing our kids to win.",
