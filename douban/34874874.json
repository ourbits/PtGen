In the middle of this crisis Juan meets Luciana, a vivacious and unpredictable woman from another city. Together they get involved in a series of entanglements after Juan comes across a former high school classmate and starts inventing an adult and successful life. Badur Hogar, a family home appliance store that Juan's father keeps closed for years, like frozen in time, becomes the place of their encounters. A strange place that was always a source of embarrassment for Juan. The shop emerges as a kind of mythic realm, facilitating an unlikely love, based on lies.",
