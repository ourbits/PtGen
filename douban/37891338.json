The three comedians soon realize that the people who have summoned them are the large families that rule the world. The comedians cannot determine whether they are here to be punished for their offensive jokes or whether they are actually at an audition. As they undergo increasingly intense tests of terror, the three friends realize they are no longer free. Faced with a choice, the comedians must choose either the perfect opportunities that fulfill their desires or their freedom.",
