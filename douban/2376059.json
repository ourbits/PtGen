    "introduction": "By the early 1970s, paramilitary terrorism resulted in the emboldening of different antifascist groups, including the Peronist Montoneros, the Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR), and the People’s Revolutionary Army (ERP). Violence between militants and popular parties inevitably increased. SWIFT documents the kidnapping of Stanley Sylvester, both an English diplomat and manager of a meat processing factory, which resulted in a better deal for employees (including 25 million pesos spent on food and supplies in neighborhoods determined by the PRT-ERP). Upon his release Sylvester said he had spent his captivity playing chess and exchanging ideas with “very intelligent young people.”",
