    "introduction": "Leaving his wife Rose for a few weeks and eager to do research for his new novel about the elderly, Henry Norman goes to live in a home for the aged, where Blossom, the home's young maid, falls in love with him. When she lets him know how she feels, however, Henry tells her that he has a wife. When his research is over, he returns to her--and discovers that she has eloped with his friend Perry Westley, and that they were both killed by a lightning bolt that struck Perry's car. While Henry recovers from this double shock, Blossom quits her job and finds work at God's Half Acre, an orphanage. While on a picnic with the children, she once again meets Henry, who realizes that he loves Blossom.",
