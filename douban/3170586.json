    "introduction": "Classic and key movie in Mexican drama and exploitation genre. This movie is rather depressing than shocking. As a kid this was a traumatic view as the main and most shocking scene takes the viewer by surprise.The title tells you half you need to know. A young man is taking a shower when some \"cubs\" attack him and devour his genitals. The scene is pretty gory and raw but I repeat, it's not that shocking; it's depressing. As a child that scene impressed and shocked me, but now as a grown-up I understand the sad situation.The rest of the plot deals with his normal life as an adult and how traumatic the experience is. He gets into a passionate relationship with a love caring and beautiful woman but everything gets horrible when they try to have a sexual relationship.The movie is not that raw in visuals but in dialogs and character development it's truly disturbing. Low budget in Mexican cinema always means crudeness. You won't be disappointed if you like difficult topics displayed into movies.",
