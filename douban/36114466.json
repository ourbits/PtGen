    "introduction": "SEQUINS is a coming of age comedy short film set in late 90s Blackpool. 17-year-old Paul's journey of self-discovery takes a unique turn when he embarks on his ambition to become a drag queen, despite fear of ridicule from his peers and being ostracized by his family. Opportunity presents itself when Paul meets drag queen Mimi Le Purr, a seasoned performer at The Sequin Club in Blackpool. With the help of Roger, (Mimi out of drag), Paul embarks on a journey of transformation, both physically and emotionally. A heartfelt comedy about learning to love yourself and trusting that those closest to you will accept you no matter what.",
