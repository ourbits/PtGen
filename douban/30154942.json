    "introduction": "A woman whose father is a public servant travelled and moved often as a child and hence was raised in Kagoshima, Okinawa and even Taiwan. Following her high school graduation she married a man from a rich family, but the man neither liked his father nor accepts money from him. Instead he works as a teacher. She had grown up well-to-do as well, but being a mere teacher's wife now she has to accomplish all the housework on her own including taking care of their two daughters. Her brother visits them one day looking for help in finding a job. He has written a poem and submitted it to a magazine. Her father also visits. Still looking for work the brother travels to China. She also begins writing and submitting poetry now. Her name is Hisajo Sugita.",
