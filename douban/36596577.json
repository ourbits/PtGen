    "introduction": "The documentary film The World According to My Dad captures the joint dream of a material physicist and his artist daughter to find an effective solution to save the planet. Together, and with humour, they venture into many different platforms where no-one is expecting or welcoming them. On their journey, they try to navigate their way not only around the world of climate politics and the powers behind it, but also with each other.",
