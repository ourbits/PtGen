Snapped cables, runaway logs and treacherous machinery are among the many dangers that threaten their lives and safety today. Follow four logging crews through a season in the remote forests of northwest Oregon and see how, plagued by mechanical failures, relentless weather and violent and unpredictable terrain, these men risk their lives every day in a constant struggle of man versus nature.",
