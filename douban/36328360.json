    "introduction": "短片的初衷是想意象化地讲述一个人处于抑郁状态中的生活，在意象与现实交替行进的过程中，最终遇到某种意外的平衡。在拍摄的过程中，我和演员决定更加淡化主人公的标签（包括心理状态和性别区分），用重复的声音和意象，来填充情绪的表象呈现。被困在透明境地里的，是茶叶，是金鱼，是人自己。困境既是囚笼也是保护。或许人只有在决定放下自己拯救他者的时候才能够摆脱这一层与世隔绝的困境。Work Statement - FloatTea, fish tank and status quo.The intention of this short film is to visualize a person’s state of depression. The film alternates between surreal imagery and reality, and finally meets a balance in some way.In the process of shooting, the actor and I decided to weaken the protagonist's label (including psychological state and gender distinction) and fill the emotional representation with repeated sound and imagery.Trapped in a transparent dilemma, tea, the goldfish and the protagonist find themselves both a cage and a protection.Perhaps one can get rid of isolation only by deciding to put oneself aside and save others.",
