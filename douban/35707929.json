    "introduction": "What makes a male, and what makes a female? Where do we draw the line, and does it really matter? Sharon-Rose Khumalo, a South African beauty queen, plunges into an identity crisis after finding out she is intersex. She needs the guidance of somebody just like her. The only person who will help is Dimakatso Sebidi, a male-presenting intersex activist who turns out to be her complete opposite. The two parallel but divergent stories are an intimate look at the struggle of living in a male-female world, when you are both, or neither. Who I Am Not gives a voice to the long-ignored and mostly silent two percent of the world's population: the intersex community.源自：https://www.filmfestival.gr/en/section-tiff/movie/1267/14889",
