Oh, and he's also sleeping with the girlfriend of Andrea, who's a lesbian and a prostitute (for men). At the same time, Maravan's nan is ill and has to come to Zurich for treatment, and the toothsome Sandana, with whom he was arranged to be married but who gave him the cold shoulder, seems not averse to rekindling the flame ...",
