From families forced to flee war and persecution, to economic migrants searching for a more prosperous life, the series will feature the journeys of over 70 people filmed in 26 countries. Keo gave cameraphones to migrants so they could capture some of the most perilous parts of their journeys that couldn’t otherwise be filmed, resulting in a series which offers a unique and extremely personal  insight into the largest period of migration in Europe since the Second World War.",
