    "introduction": "Metal Gear Saga is the title of two separately produced documentaries released in DVD format covering the Metal Gear series, the first one released in 2006 and a second in 2008. The title was originally used for a public presentation of the series Hideo Kojima and his staff conducted in 2005.The second volume was originally released in Japan in 2007 (where it was simply titled Metal Gear Saga, since Volume 1 was never released there) as a bonus to customers who purchased Metal Gear 20th Anniversary: Metal Gear Solid Collection. In North America and Europe, an English version of the documentary was released as a bonus to customers who pre-ordered Metal Gear Solid 4.The documentary narrates the fictional events of the Metal Gear storyline beginning with Metal Gear Solid 3 and up to the events leading to Metal Gear Solid 4. The documentary centers around an undisclosed narrator (voiced by Masane Tsukuyama in Japanese and Guy Perryman in English) attempting to track Solid Snake down and narrates the history surrounding him, his father Big Boss (Naked Snake) and his brothers Liquid Snake and Solidus Snake.",
