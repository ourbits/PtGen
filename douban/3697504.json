    "introduction": "Since their childhood days, Atoy (Christopher de Leon) and Ruben (Sen. Jinggoy Estrada) were the closest of friends. It was not surprising that they remained the best of friends even decades later when Atoy and Ruben had their own families. Atoy became a successful businessman, married to the beautiful Tere (Dawn Zulueta) and with two children, Jonie (AJ Perez) and Katrina (Empress Shuck). Ruben, the more proud and headstrong of the two, found a wife in Eden (Maricel Laxa), with two sons Benjie (Ryan Julio) and Dodie (Justine Plummer).The relationship between Atoy and Ruben remained the same through the years. Despite their closeness, Atoy was literally Rubens kuya, going out of his way to take care of Ruben whenever he found himself in trouble or even giving him a sense of control. Even the wives and their children knew about this: the two families were so intertwined that they were closer than their real relatives.",
