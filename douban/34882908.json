    "introduction": "The musically talented, but socially challenged Henry (14) arrives at a private boarding school for music students at the be- ginning of a new school year. There, he unexpectedly discovers his fascination with playing the organ. From the fascination, a general love arise for the instrument, the playing of which offer Henry a refuge from the bullying that his fellow students puts him through. His teacher Ms. Schmidt(43) recognizes his talent. Her growing interest in Henry, however, further worsens his position with his roommates Erik(14), Mik(14) and Sbastian/Sebi(13). Erik feels that his status as the school's prodigy is threat- ened, his talent as an organ player has saved him from relegation for years. Erik rules the school and is together with Melanie (14), who has had Henry under her spell, since he first arrived at the school. Erik and his minions Sebi and Mik, do all they can to make Henry's life a living hell.",
