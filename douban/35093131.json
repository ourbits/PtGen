    "introduction": "The music video for the song was directed by Joseph Kahn, and portrayed Gaga dancing at an underground subway station and in a parking lot. The music video was a tribute from the singer to the New York lifestyle including its glamour, fans and fashion. It was influenced by the music video for Michael Jackson's \"Bad\", which also took place in a subway station. The music video was banned from broadcast at the PG-rated time slots in Australian television channels because of its sexual content",
