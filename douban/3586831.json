    "introduction": "Set back in 1870 in Argentina when several upheavals were happening all at once (increased European immigration, a new government, the tango...), this uneven drama looks at conflicts between rebel groups and the new federal government. One band of mountain-dwelling, gun-toting fighters is just as pro-Argentina as the government yet for various reasons, the leader of this group decides it is time to give up the fight and go home. Before he can follow through himself, the leader of another rebel band kills him and by that action, sets the federal army on his trail. Notable in its music and direction by Catrano Catrani, not all facets of the film hold up equally well.",
