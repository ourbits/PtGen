    "introduction": "Zebedy Colt and Roger Caine play two mixed-up American telephone repairmen who stow away on a plane and end up parachuting out over Munich, Germany during the Olympics. Broke and horny, the guys meet up with a lovely young fraulein who gets them a job - but not before introducing them to sex, German style! It's one riotous mishap after another as the bumbling buffoons go from job to job - and girl to girl - in an attempt to make enough cash to get back to the States. But with all the blazing bratwurst and hot wenches these guys have on their hands, who'd want to go back? Actually shot on location in Munich, this is a slap-happy sexvid that will keep you in stitches - even as it drives you wild.",
