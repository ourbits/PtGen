    "introduction": "我们可爱的巴拉斯爷爷原来以前也是玩超现实的。。。：-）\"2 Eggs; to break, broke, broken\", the only English phrase spoken and theme song in Tinto Brass' \"L'Urlo\". What a film! The only available version of this film I could find had no subtitles. Either way it doesn't matter since it is very visual. When most people here the name Tinto Brass, right away they think of the horrid sleaze epic \"Caligula\", or some might name \"Salon Kitty\". If your lucky, you'll here of some who have seen his fun slapstick sex comedies from Italy like \"Miranda\" and \"All Ladies Do it\". Known mainly for his lighthearted sex romps with curvy women, Tinto Brass' earliest experimental films were much different. Heres a recipe for a film like \"L'Urlo\". Take some Fellini, add some Jodorowsky/Arrabal and a little table spoon of Godard for extra kick, stir and you got yourself \"L'Urlo\". One crazy psychedelic, surrealist anti-war art orgy. A bus is lit on fire! Hippies are chased by riot cops. There's stock footage of Vietnam and other wars with a machine gun showdown! S&M, slapstick sexuality, a man's pursuit of a beautiful lady... abstract art and nudity galore! Most memorable is a man in a gas mask jumping around with nude people while goose feather's fill the air! One amazing experimental protest movie! Rebel art at its finest! The films music and images are amazing! This is one film that screams for a DVD release, not to mention a soundtrack. The one song during the burning bus scene sounded like the punk band \"Dead Kennedys\", almost 10 years before they were around. This film is pure punk rock, before punk even existed. Who says that political, subversive films can't be fun? This ones a must see!",
