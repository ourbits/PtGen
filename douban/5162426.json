    "introduction": "Gabrielle, a pleasant woman in her sixties, learns that she is about to be evicted from her second-hand shop, and that she is about to become a grandmother. Her friends advise her to take this opportunity to begin enjoying the joys of retirement. However, at the same time, Gabrielle meets Fred, a well-built young man whose youth attracts her as much her maturity, her freedom, and her social standing fascinates him. Although their respective circle of friends are horrified by the relationship (his friends think she's an elderly cougar....her friends think he's a gigolo), Fred and Gabrielle are going to try and enjoy their love story, ignoring the boundaries of age and social class.",
