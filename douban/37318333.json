    "introduction": "From humble beginnings, Elizabeth Lane is the founder/CEO of Lane Cosmetics, a $1 billion company. When Lane Cosmetics was just a pipe dream thirty-five years ago, single and poor Elizabeth went into early labor on Christmas Eve, she, on the road in a snowstorm, stopping into a closed diner in the small town of Brookswood where a handful of the leading citizens of the town were convening for a meeting. If not for those people, Elizabeth and her daughter born that evening, Evie Lane, probably would not have survived. While Elizabeth has tried to provide Evie with the growing up she never had, Elizabeth now feels that Evie's privilege has not served her well in she always falling back on her trust whenever she gives up on every pursuit she's ever attempted. As such, two weeks before Evie's thirty-fifth birthday, Elizabeth sends her to Brookswood with a photo of the two of them and the four people in the diner that evening. Incognito, Evie is to search out those four people to provide them with whatever their most heartfelt wish. Elizabeth's goal, which Evie cannot see or truly understand, is for Evie to gain a sense of gratitude for her life instead of taking it for granted. To provide Evie some incentive, Elizabeth has given her until Christmas Eve to complete this mission, failure to do so prompting Elizabeth to donate Evie's entire trust to a charity of her choice. Evie goes into the mission with a sense of anger at her mother for upending her life in this manner just before Christmas. Knowing she needs a lawyer to deal with the legal implications of the gifts, she ends up hiring the only lawyer in town, native son Kyle Newman who is initially reluctant to take the case due to it sounding more like a publicity stunt, but who eventually decides to take it in learning more about the nature of the gifts. With Kyle's help, Evie learns that finding the four people is not the difficult part, but convincing any of the four to accept a gift of any sort the challenge. Regardless of if Evie is able to complete the challenge, the question becomes whether she will gain a new, more appreciative perspective of her life as is Elizabeth's want.",
