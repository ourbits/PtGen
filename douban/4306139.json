    "introduction": "This 1985 Colombian/Cuban production had a hard act to follow, its excellent 1965 precursor by the great Mexican director, Arturo Ripstein. This version OF TIEMPO DE MORIR is a worthy remake. Its mix of Cuban and Colombian characters (though discernible by most Latin-Americans) create a non-descript Latin American atmosphere, in equally non-descript Latin American locations. This is of course in line with the author's intentions, so this Pan-Latin American feel is felt almost as well in this film as in Garcia Marquez' books. The likewise pan-Latin American themes of machismo, family honor, Catholicism, law through gun power, oppressed women, and revenge are very well presented throughout the script and by the camera. This is a little-known Latin-American film worth watching.",
