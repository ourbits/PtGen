    "introduction": "In the wake of an atomic disaster, the entire male population of the Earth has been rendered sterile, except for a young man named Adam who was deep below the planet's surface in an iron mine at the time of the accident. This hapless nonentity suddenly finds himself feted as humanity's savior, exhibited to international teams of scientists, and instructed to leave his wife and instead join his new harem of beauty contest winners; until, that is, the fateful day when other males start to regain their potency and Adam is no longer 'special'. This satirical sci-fi movie is of interest not merely for its candid approach to sex and sexuality, but also because it's an unauthorized adaptation of Pat Frank's 1946 novel 'Mr. Adam'.",
