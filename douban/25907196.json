    "introduction": "Sabine Lidl shows a very personal portrait of the New York photographer Nan Goldin. The director accompanies the artist alone with her camera from Paris to Berlin, where Nan Goldin meets old friends, to undergo with them through the different stages of her moved life. Thereby Nan Goldin gives deep insights into her soul, touches the spectator with her directness, also at the most melancholy moments, not least through her quite own humor. The frame of the film is built by Nan Goldin's Slide shows and unique photographs. Intimate moments reflect the relations with friends and their intensity which grant the film quite a special mark.",
