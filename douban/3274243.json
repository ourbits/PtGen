    "introduction": "本片是70年代南斯拉夫黑浪潮电影运动中的一部重要作品，克罗地亚导演Krsto Papic因此片而获得了极高的赞誉。影片借由一个Mrdusa Donja地区的小山村里全体村民打算排演《哈姆雷特》剧的故事揭示出克罗地亚社会主义体制下的各种问题，是用戏剧的手段间接批判共产主义极权的电影代表作。影片获1974年柏林电影节金熊奖提名。In Shakespeare's Hamlet, the leading character observes \"The play's the thing, wherein to catch the conscience of the king.\" In this Yugoslavian movie, a performance of Hamlet in a small village apparently catches the conscience of the whole town. The village commissar, who knows nothing of the play, insists on mounting a production of Hamlet over the objections of the village teacher, who knows the tale well. Thinking only of the prestige it will bring, the commissar plans to use local villagers in the parts. The son of a man the commissar had framed for theft gets the part of Hamlet, and the commissar plays the usurping king. During a fight scene, the boy Hamlet, manages to wrest a confession to the thefts from the town treasurer, but when he hears of his father's suicide, he promptly stabs the commissar. The commissar, bleeding, orders the post-performance dance to go on. AKA Predstava Hamleta u selu Mrdusa Donja / A Hamlet performance in the village of Lower Mrdusha.HAMLET, A LITTLE VILLAGE SHOW (PREDSTAVA HAMLETA U MRDUSI DONJOJ), 1973, Jadran Film, 88 min. In the rocky village of Mrdusa Donja, all the villagers are rehearsing Shakespeare's Hamlet to celebrate the anniversary of the president's election. Amusing and grotesque, Hamlet becomes a folk drama revealing the true nature of its real-life cast. Krsto Papic has received high praise for his masterly direction of this film.",
