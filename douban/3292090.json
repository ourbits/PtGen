    "introduction": "Here is another freaky work for the “liberation through trash”!Buttgereit himself about the plot: The plot goes like this: Adolf Hitler’s brain has survived. The crazy Nazi-doctor Ilse von Blitzen hires the master of life and death: Dracula himself (Adolfo Assor). He is supposed to resuscitate Teutonic human material with his bite. The reward that has been chosen is the virgin Maria – Captain Berlin’s daughter (Sandra Steffl). Super hero Captain Berlin (Jürg Plüss) now has to confront these two monsters. Since the 1940ies he wants to eliminate Hitler, but now he first has to save his daughter from the vampire. The film is based on a stage play I wrote and directed. My friend Thilo Gosejohann filmed the stage play and made this film out of it. So, its a mix betweeen film and stageplay.",
