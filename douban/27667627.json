    "introduction": "Malenfant plunges us into the heart of the life of a go-getter, working and dreaming for whom everything is possible, that of Raymond Malenfant. Starting from nothing and driven by the desire to build, he sets up an impressive empire. Supported by his wife, Colette, and four children, he becomes one of the most outstanding entrepreneurs in Quebec (Canada). The conflict of Manoir Richelieu explodes while Raymond is at the height of his glory. As the owner of the establishment, he is in the headlines while refusing to recognize the union. Follows for Raymond Malenfant bankruptcy, one of the largest in the history of the country. His hotel empire collapses like a house of cards. While it is believed annihilated, Raymond Malenfant has not yet said his last word.",
