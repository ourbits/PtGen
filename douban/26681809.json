    "introduction": "Gregor is a rudderless mid-20s man with a CV thick with short-lived experiences and thin on worthwhile experience. On his way to a party he meets and bonds with Terry, an articulate magazine editor, weathered by the 1990s. At the party Gregor meets Amber, a transatlantic trustafarian who struggles to mask her liberal guilt with pro-bono 'activism.' With Terry offering him a job and Amber offering both material and physical indulgence, Gregor thinks he's landed on his feet...but he hasn't. 'Gregor' is a black comedy where nothing is resolved, no lessons are learned and focusing on a generation who feel they should be able to do anything by right and end up doing nothing by default.",
