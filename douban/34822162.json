    "introduction": "With unprecedented access to David Cameron himself, and drawing on the testimony of leading allies and critics from his close team, party, and coalition partners, the Cameron Years charts David Cameron’s prime ministerial career, from his rise to power as a young leader and his time in office, to the legacy he has left.Cameron led the first peacetime coalition government since the Second World War, before unexpectedly winning the General Election in 2015 to form a Conservative majority government. He then triggered the biggest political earthquake for decades by holding a referendum on the back of an election campaign promise.Now, for the first time in this two-part documentary series, the former Prime Minister speaks candidly about his recollections and his time in power.",
