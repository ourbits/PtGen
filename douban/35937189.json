    "introduction": "In medieval Tallinn, the master of the famous knightage who saved the Baltic Sea from the pirates is murdered and his gold necklace disappears. The sheriff asks Melchior, an apothecary to investigate the case. He discovers that the deceased was looking for the ‘Prisoner of Tallinn’ and he suspects the Dominican monastery. While horrific serial killings are uncovered, Melchior begins to suspect his apprentice, who seems to have something to hide. Based on the novel of the same title, Melchior the Apothecary reinterprets this historical drama in a contemporary way, combining the traditional medieval adventure genre and a romance plot with a narrative of serial killing and conspiracy theory. The corrupt authority in the medieval town resembles the injustice in our present society. The scenery of Tallinn with its medieval atmosphere is another pleasing main feature. Despite being a historical drama, plenty of gory scenes add tension to the film. (Jin PARK)",
