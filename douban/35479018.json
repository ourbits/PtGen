    "introduction": "Jan Pampuch, a modest toy seller, may not break the daddy’s word given to his daughter. The problem is that her drawing unexpectedly causes a heated conflict of views and becomes number one message in the news and social media. The scandal keeps unfolding. Jan, confused with the scale of the dispute, has to do everything to settle it because his company and the future of his entire family are at stake. Also, he may not forget about the promise he made to his little girl. The Case of Jan Pampuch is a comedy of the absurd underlain with political satire and a perverse commentary on our (not just Polish) tribal reality. Maybe laughter is the best defence?",
