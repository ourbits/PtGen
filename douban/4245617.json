    "introduction": "The film is based on an actual Quaker International Seminar Programme held in the northeast in June 1975, in which government officials, foreign experts, intellectuals and farmers met to discuss proposed hydroelectric projects using the Mekong River. Among these participants was a farmer called Tongpan, who arrived with just 20 baht in his pocket. He left the seminar, returning home to find his sick wife had died. A few seminar participants sought unsuccessfully to find Tongpan, but their experience prompted them to create a script on his tragedy and eventually this film.",
