    "introduction": "Three close friends meet when their former schoolmate asks them to attend a funeral. As the day is spoilt anyway, they walk around in their native city, visiting old friends. Each meeting opens another page from the past, which they really had tried to forget. The reality of the present, the world that surrounds them is not really pleasant. The three friends, all belonging to the generation of 40-year-olds who have lived through the age of perestroika, end up in a series of adventures: They get drunk and eventually return home after their partly funny and partly scary “day out”.",
