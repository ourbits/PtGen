    "introduction": "Transylvanian Express is an ultra low budget horror film which hurls an unsuspecting heroine into a maelstrom of gangsters, the undead, monstrous pigs and the most foul-mouthed vampire ever. It rockets along from grisly resurrection to vampire carnage to gore-splattered showdown. Taut, energetic and entertaining, it delivers a whirlwind of action and a fistful of wisecracks. It's a thrill-o-rama ride. All killer and no filler. Transylvanian Express - home of the vampire pig.",
