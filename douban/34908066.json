She was a midwife and a healer for over forty years in the deep desertic Sertão of Northeast Brazil. Her name was Aurora. I did not get to know her. From one encounter to another, with the alive and the dead, the film follows the traces of Aurora’s ghost and confronting the structural violence, gender and racial wise, present in Brazil’s historical formation.",
