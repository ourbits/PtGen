    "introduction": "10 years after the release of his epic film “Maidan”, Sergei Loznitsa continues his Ukrainian chronicles and documents his country’s struggle against the Russian invasion. Shot over a 2-year period, the film portrays the life of the civilian population all over Ukraine and presents a unique and ultimate statement of Ukrainian resilience in the face of a barbaric invasion. In the second part of his Ukrainian diptych, Loznitsa paints a monumental canvas of a nation determined to defend its right to exist.",
