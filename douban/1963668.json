The entire ceremony is supervised by a seventh person, who, like a photographer, looks at the group from different angles and rearranges the group by hand-signals.The picture is perfect. The camera shifts position and discloses a squad of soldiers with rifles at the ready; rifles aimed at the group of six. Volley of shots. Fade out. The End.",
