    "introduction": "讲述一个瓜拉尼族少年告别平静的乡村生活来到BsAs打工，在那里遇见了自己的初恋，却也因为受到不良的诱惑而走上犯罪的道路。和当时南美许多此类社会题材影片一样，如秘鲁的《格雷格里奥》，委内瑞拉的《我是罪犯》，哥伦比亚的《街童往事》等等，此片也是表现南美原住民少年在大城市里的种种诱惑下逐渐迷失原本善良的天性的，尽管此类题材现在已不是南美电影的主流，但作为时代剧它依然反映出了当时南美国家所普遍存在的一些社会问题，尤其是青少年问题。Ciro Cappellari was born in Buenos Aires in 1959 where he trained to be a photographer and made his first short films. In 1985, he came to Berlin to study at the German Film & Television Academy (dffb) and has worked as a screenwriter, director and cameraman in Germany, Switzerland, the USA and Argentina since 1990. He was director of photography on films by Marcel Gisler, Didi and Pepe Danquart, including the OSCAR-winning Black Rider (Schwarzfahrer, 1993). He has directed Amor America (documentary, 1989), Hijo del Rio (1991) and Sin Querer (1997).",
