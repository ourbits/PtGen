    "introduction": "Xmas Meier explores the impact of contemporary architecture on people’s daily lives, and describes how the new church designed by Richard Meier in 2003 has transformed the life of the Tor Tre Teste neighbourhood in Rome, lifting it from anonymity to international renown. A surprinsingly successful sinergy of its architectural symbolism and its real impact on the area’s urban fabric.Residents from the neighbourhood, filmed over the Christmas period, talk about how this new architectural icon affects their lives. Controversy, caustic irony and free speech opposed to the faithful’s devotion. Welcome to Rome!",
