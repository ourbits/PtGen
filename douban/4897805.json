    "introduction": "Fifteen \"sans-papiers\" children (clandestine immigrants) describe their fight to be allowed to stay in France, and their fear of being expelled. After living in France illegally for years, sometimes since their birth, they believed that a recent law would allow them to obtain an authorization to stay, helping them to lead a better life. They had to reveal their identity and address in the process, and their applications were finally rejected, \"arbitrarily\". This is a plea to allow them to grow up in France, which they consider their home.",
