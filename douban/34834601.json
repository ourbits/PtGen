    "introduction": "The National Geographic Channel looks 200 years into the future in Collapse, based on author Jared Diamond's book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, to examine how current habits might affect humans' ability to survive. Directed by Noel Dockstader and narrated by Jamie Effros, this documentary examines how relationships among current methods could lead to human extinction. Shortages of land, water, and energy could potentially propel civilization to collapse; choices such as sustainable, local farming and organic practices are highlighted as ways to ensure life on Earth continues.",
