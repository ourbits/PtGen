    "introduction": "Spain 1813Aided by Ducos, Napoleon is considering a plan.  All it will take is one death and one imprisonment, and Britain will leave Spain.  The Spanish nobility, generals and church will have to be in agreement and bring pressure on the deposed King of Spain to sign a treaty with France.In a French garrison in Spain, Ducos has impounded the carriages of La Marquesa Helene Mendora.  La Marquesa is half-English, half-French and married to a Spanish General.  She is also a French spy.  Ducos promises the return of her carriages if she writes to her husband saying Richard Sharpe has forced his attentions on her.When the Marques receives the letter he is furious and demands an apology or a duel.  Sharpe refuses to apologise as he says he doesn't know the Marquesa, and the duel is arranged.  Duels are forbidden in Wellingtons army and when discovered, it is passed off as 'sword practice'.  The same night the Marques is murdered in his bed, and the Spanish, believing Sharpe is responsible, demand retribution.  Wellington has no choice and a court marshal takes place.  Sharpe is found guilty and sentenced to hang.  Wellington, however, does not plan to lose Sharpe.La Marquesa and her carriages are ambushed, the carriages taken and La Marquesa is put into a convent.  Maj. Nairn takes Harper out of the camp and reunites him with Sharpe.  Left with having to prove his honour, Sharpe and Harper are tasked with rescuing La Marquesa, so the British can discover the enemy’s next move.",
