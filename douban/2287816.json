    "introduction": "科尔皮的前三部影片都很好：《长别离》《科迪内》和《无名星》，其中后两部是与罗马尼亚合拍的，这三部影片确定了他在法国新浪潮电影界的位置。Miroiu (Claude Rich) is a reserved and eccentric educator who teaches math and astronomy in a small village in Rumania. When he discovers a new star, he orders a book that will arrive at the local train station. He meets Mona (Marina Vlady), a flashy female who has just left her lover at a gambling casino after an argument. Since she boarded the train with no money, the conductor orders her off the train at the village. Miroiu offers her his home to stay in while he spends the night at the home of a fellow teacher, and though at first Mona finds Miroiu rather odd, romance eventually ensues. The next day, Mona's lover breezes into town in a luxury car to take her back to the world of bright lights and money, light years away from life in the small Rumanian village.A gentle comedy, made by a group of Romanian and French artists, and the second film to be directed in Romania by Henri Colpi. The story concerns a chance meeting between two disparate personalities: the glamorous, rather inscrutable Mona, who suddenly appears one night in evening dress at the railway station of a small town; and the shy teacher, Miroiu, a bachelor who hesitantly offers to give her shelter for the night. His gesture is one of kindness, because Mona's beauty frightens him. She is a creature of impulse, obviously well-kept and frivolous. She has had a quarrel with her lover in a swank gambling casino in the nearby metropolis, and had impetuously fled and jumped on the first train. Colpi then shows the effect of Mona's presence upon the rest of the town, peopled by some colorful characters who appear indignant, fascinated or outraged by turn. Miroiu's career is jeopardized by the scandal and his emotions are disturbed by Mona, whose inscrutability he compares to certain constellations in his astronomical studies. This comedy of character, set in the 1930s, is illuminated by a series of brilliant cameo performances. The atmosphere of the town itself is strange to us; and although the types are familiar, the Romanian temperament has its own special fascination. Claude Rich is rapidly becoming one of the major character actors of international cinema, and his performance as the retiring, poetic teacher, thrown together with a sophisticated woman of the world, has much of the charm one remembers from Gary Cooper in his Frank Capra days.",
