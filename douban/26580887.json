The tribute to art and cinema Walerian Borowczyk fits symbolically in an overlap between the fence and the divine abode of the unconscious , expressed here for reports of images, sounds, faces, objects and mechanisms, where time and space are dilated and flow from the invisible to the real, immanent to the transcendent.",
