Thus, Phanthep relentlessly pursues Mek to seize the other piece of the cane for himself. Mai, Mek's son, witnesses his father being bullied and strives to stand up and fight to protect those he loves. When one seeks to seize and the other strives to protect, the boy molded by goodness... is about to choose his path to prove himself!",
