    "introduction": "Although 1994's football World Cup final didn't turn out to be very spectacular, millions of people worldwide gathered round their TV sets to watch who would become the world's best team. This documentary by A. Rogenhagen follows football fans from 40 countries around the globe how they watch and react to the match. Keeping the chronological order while cutting to different locations around the globe makes this film interesting in the first place. Regardless of being a monk in Czechoslovakia, living a harem in Cameroon, drinking some beer in Germany, working in a factory in Iran or being a supporter of one of the finalists Italy and Brazil, this documentary shows how all kinds of people share their common interest in the biggest match in football.",
