    "introduction": "The story of a band that shaped history against their will. It is an artistic documentary looking back at the more than thirty years the band has been around, but rather than focusing on its history the main focus is on the conflict between creative freedom and totalitarianism. Although The Plastic People never called themselves a political protest group they became one of the symbols of resistance to the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia in the 1970s and 80s. Their imprisonment led to an international outcry in the field of culture and contributed to the launch of Charter 77 in Czechoslovakia.",
