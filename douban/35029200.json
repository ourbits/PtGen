One night, Rei strongly wishes that she could meet her real father, who was separated from her at an early age by her parents’ divorce. From that night onward, introverted Rei’s heart burns with an enduring passion. Through conversations with her mother, complicated memories, dreams and her reunion with her father, Rei’s thoughts about her family are gradually revealed.",
