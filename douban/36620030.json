    "introduction": "She is regarded as one of Britain's most well-known personalities and the spouse of England player Wayne Rooney, who has the 2nd most goals for his country. It recounts how Coleen became an amateur web sleuth to try to figure out why private information about herself and her family kept turning up in the media, exposing one of the greatest tabloid news stories in Britain for the past ten years. The three-part series explores the events that led to Coleen's infamous Instagram post that \"broke the Internet\" and her subsequent victorious defense in one of the most high-profile defamation cases heard by the UK's High Court in recent memory. It will examine Coleen's life as it has been played out in public for the past 20 years in addition to the case itself.",
