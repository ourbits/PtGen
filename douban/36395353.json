    "introduction": "An iconoclastic instigator of the Nouvelle Vague, Varda reinvented film and what stories it could tell. Varda herself is an instantly recognisable figure, who we have come to know through her own lens. While she often portrayed and featured herself in her own films, Viva Varda! provides a counter-shot through interviews and previously unseen archive materials. “I never choose a single version of things. It seems to me unfair to show the Sun and colour without immediately showing also the shadows and faces of an anonymous crowd” (Agnès Varda).源自：https://doclisboa.org/2023/en/filmes/viva-varda/",
