    "introduction": "ANGST is a psychological study in the form of a film. An emotionally deeply rooted, yet mentally terrorizing relationship between an empath and a sociopath, serves as a microcosmic example to analyze the inexplicable phenomenon of aeons: LOVE. Thus, V.irtue descends to planet Earth to deliver a report about the earthlings' ways of life. However, once he falls in love with the young Keyvan, he becomes exposed to the darkest secret of them all: the desire and fear of love. Once the report is handed over to Frau Dr. Oberhaupt, an interrogation within a superterrestrial constellation begins. What occurred to V.irtue on Earth and how come the best thing about earthly life can cause so much pain?",
