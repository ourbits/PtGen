    "introduction": "A compelling and colourful documentary celebrating the golden age of air travel when, during the 1920s and 1930s, Britain ruled the skies and style and glamour were a passport to adventure. In Britain in the 1920s and 30s a revolution took place that would change forever our perspective on the world. While the country was in the grip of recession, dashing pilots and daring socialites took to the air, pushed back boundaries and forged new links across the globe. The era of commercial air travel was born. This documentary tells the story of this golden age of British aviation and of how the original 'jet set' shaped air travel for generations to come.",
