    "introduction": "'Ek tha Bhujang' is a story of a 10 years old boy wanting to play the role of Lord Krishna... the hindu GOD, in the school drama. There's only one thing that stops him from getting this role. He is a muslim boy. The teacher who is directing the drama believes that a muslim boy should not play the role of Hindu GOD. Since the drama is about Lord Krishna's battle with a large snake, Kabir invents a lie in form of Bhujang which means a large snake in hindi. How that lie gets bigger than him and how he faces his fears to get the role is what \"Ek tha Bhujang\" is all about.",
