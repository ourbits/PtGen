    "introduction": "Estrellita — Take Away Song is the more conventional of the prize winners in its cinematic language. At the same time, this Slovenian tale of music and mourning displays Metod Pevec's keen eye for striking images all the while the violin carries the song of the film. Thirteen-year-old Amir is drawn to a particular violin — \"Estrellita\", as its owner named it, and that man, now deceased, is nonetheless a spiritual father to the boy whose own dad can't stop drinking enough to notice his son's talent. They live in old barracks as Bosnian refugees not far from where Amir met his \"maestro\" and played with him once in a pub. The best Amir can get from his real dad is a lift in the crane at his work site where father and son sit side-by-side as Amir plays his music \"at the top of the world\". It's a memorable shot, from a low angle straight up, and an equally memorable moment for both in the story about a father and son who must separate to find themselves. The International Jury gave Silva Cusin a Special Mention as the actress who plays the maestro's widow. Both inspired and inspiring, she intuitively ensures her late husband's legacy of music for Amir.Cottbus Film Festival of Young East European CinemaYear\tResult\tAward\tCategory/Recipient(s)2007 \tWon \tDialog AwardMetod PevecFestróia - Tróia International Film FestivalYear\tResult\tAward\tCategory/Recipient(s)2008 \tWon \tAudience AwardMetod PevecMotovun Film FestivalYear\tResult\tAward\tCategory/Recipient(s)2008 \tWon \tAmnesty International AwardMetod PevecSlovene Film FestivalYear\tResult\tAward\tCategory/Recipient(s)2007 \tWon \tVesna \tBest ActressSilva Cusin",
