    "introduction": "故事发生在波斯尼亚和黑塞哥维那(波黑)，1991年，南斯拉夫社会主义联邦共和国解体之后，南斯拉夫内战之前，在德国流放了20多年的主人公开着梅赛德斯载着20岁的女友回到故乡黑塞哥维那。电影改编自波黑著名作家Ivica Đikić的同名小说。by 54f8inThe film is set in the Herzegovina part of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the early 1990s, after the dissolution of Yugoslavia, and slightly before the Yugoslav Wars. It tells an emotional story of a man coming back to his hometown after many years abroad and dealing with his past and current family, using the political dealings of the region as a backdrop. It is based on the novel Cirkus Columbia by well known Bosnian writer Ivica Đikić.Bosnia and Herzegovina, 1991. The communists have fallen from power and Divko Buntic returns to the small town where he grew up to reclaim his family home. After a 20-year exile in Germany, Divko arrives in his flashy red Mercedes with sexy young girlfriend Azra, lucky black cat Bonny and a pocketful of Deutschmarks. Divko uses his money and connections to forcefully evict estranged wife Lucija, but he tries to reunite with 20-year-old son Martin. When Divko's beloved cat Bonny disappears, the whole town joins in a frantic search to get the cash reward. The daily hunt for the missing cat strains Divko's fragile relationship with Azra and opens up an unexpected but strong attraction between Azra and Martin. Busy fretting over everyday concerns, most of the townsfolk seem to disregard the rumbling political unrest: Croatia has seceded, all Yugoslavs are being forced to take sides, and the Serbs begin bombing Dubrovnik.",
