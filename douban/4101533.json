During a cocktail reception following a national convention on Turkey's automobile industry, prominent Turkish journalists, bureaucrats and businessmen join President Cemal Gursel in a discussion of the country's potential of building its own industry. When the president says Turkey has the power tomanufacture cars on its own, the issue suddenly turns into a challenge that everybody in attendance is willing to take. The president orders for the first car to be out of the factory on the upcoming Republic Day, which is just a few months away.\"Cars of the Revolution”, based on a true story, is the emotional saga spanning 130 days behind the first car produced in Turkey in 1961, a year after the military seized power.
