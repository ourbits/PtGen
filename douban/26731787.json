People suddenly found that there was plenty of time in their lives due to less of sleep. The demand for food and energy skyrocketed tremendously. As a result, the World War III broke out. In order to prevent humankind from extinction, the governments of countries worldwide had been desperately seeking for 'The Sleep-ables,' only hundreds of whom survived, all over the world, attempting to preserve invaluable human heritage. After the immense scouting and probing, they eventually discovered that the man who called Leo slept soundly on the bed... This is a story about insomnia.",
