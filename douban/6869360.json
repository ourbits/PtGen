    "introduction": "In a grisly spectacle of carnage, an unknown number of severed body parts wash ashore at Sandy Hook. A jogger literally stumbled upon an upper torso that had washed ashore as she sprinted down the beach at the end of the torrential hurrican that had knocked out power and had folks heading for the mainland. Police were summoned to the stately manor house of Mr Creepo after neighbors complained of screams coming from the property during Halloween week by seven strippers. Located just off the beach - a stones throw from he area's historic landmark lighthouse -- the dwelling sits atop catacombed chambers that lead to the town's now desolate funhouse that once attracted throngs of visitors. One source said it was the most grisly crime scene they had ever witnessed, with mangled bodies scattered everywhere.",
