    "introduction": "\"The key to a great summer camp is the quality of its staff. At Beaver Falls, we pride ourselves on recruiting only the finest, most morally upstanding young adults from across the globe. So you can rest easy knowing your children are in safe hands at Beaver Falls!\"Best friends Flynn (Robertson), A-Rab (Ali) and Barry (Dagleish) are three normal ol' British lads who met at Uni. Now freshly graduated, they're determined to have one last carefree summer of fun before facing the cold, hard realities of real life... and they're going to do it in style.Somehow, they've managed to blag themselves jobs at Beaver Falls, an elite American summer camp for the ridiculously tanned and beautiful teenage offspring of California's rich and powerful.This is a summer job that requires them to be responsible. To set an example. To be role models to their young charges... yeah, whatevs! There's no way they're going to let the job spec get in the way of their single-minded pursuit of The Ultimate Summer.Two months of hanging out, chasing girls and getting into mischief beckon for these boys, who are all set for time of their lives. But things have a habit of not quite working out the way they expect: no one mentioned that the kids they'd be looking after would be that annoying...",
