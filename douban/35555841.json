    "introduction": "Pablo and Rodrigo are thirty years old and are the real survivors of a student massacre in a town in Argentine Patagonia. Fifteen years ago, one of his classmates entered the school and, having seized his military father's gun, fired at close range, inaugurating the first school massacre in Latin America. Pablo and Rodrigo never saw the former comrade who shot them again, the immediate transfer made him invisible, never answered the questions he opened with his shots. Fifteen years later, Pablo and Rodrigo embark on a journey of more than a thousand kilometers, looking for him. To take revenge, to do some kind of justice? To stop dealing with the past? To hear their repentance, or simply want to find him to stop inventing him?",
