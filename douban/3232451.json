    "introduction": "Annie, an English girl in secondary school, waits for a train. A woman who has smiled at Annie is in the station waiting room. Annie notices a ring on the woman's little finger. We hear Annie's internal monologue - about being attracted to other girls, her relationship with her friends, and her fear of exposure. In the station, Annie does something spontaneous and foolish, all the while imagining full-color encounters with this stranger. Will she find a way to speak to the woman she finds attractive?",
