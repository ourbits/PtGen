    "introduction": "Undersea photograher Alex has a serious accident during an assignment and suffers cerebral damage. After the accident, he returns to Montreal. It was here half a year ago that he separated from his ex-wife. On his return, he thinks he could start all over again. Turning on his good looks and charm, he attempts to rebuild his life, changing like a chameleon as he reacts to the people and circumstances around him, including a selfish boss, a neurotic drug addict and his friend's girl, with serious repercussions. They mystery is peeled off layer by layer. It is not until the very end that one knows whether the underwater accident is in a curse or a blessing. The visuals of the photograher-turned director are unique. Close-ups of the iris and the sudden insertion of soft-shell crab images forebade danger like the flashing of red lights.",
