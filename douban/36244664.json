    "introduction": "Documentary about American singer songwriter John Hiatt. Filmed in Austin, Texas and Nashville, Tennessee. We see John Hiatt on tour with his band, and visiting Nashville where he started his musical career as a 9-5 writer of country songs. The film pays a visit to Tree Music, a 'song factory' in the middle of Nashville, where John worked for several years. There's a meeting with Curly Putman, who performs his classic Green Green Grass of Home on acoustic guitar, a song that made millions of dollars for both writer and publishing company Tree Music. And there's an interview with songwriter and performing artist Guy Clark, in his office, playing 'Desperado's waiting for a train', one of John Hiatt's favorite songs. The film also contains several live versions of songs that John Hiatt never recorded, like the amazing 'A Crazy girl is hard to find' performed acoustically by Hiatt in front of the camera.",
