    "introduction": "In June 2002, a bus on its way to Tiberius from Tel Aviv was bombed.17 people were killed, 16 were identified. No. 17 wasn’t.He was buried a few weeks later as ‘John Doe’.The police stopped searching, believing that he must have been a foreign work immigrant.This is where the filmmakers step in, documenting in real time over a period of six months the search for the identity of a man no one claimed missing.This mode of investigation simultaneously examines the those involved in a process that oscillates between the acts of looking for and providing identities, as it depicts a society living under the constant shadow of death. When it seems that the investigation has reached a dead end a vague lead appears, followed by resolution none could have imagined.",
