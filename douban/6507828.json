    "introduction": "Return to Devil's End was a direct-to-video reunion documentary released by Reeltime Pictures in 1993, and re-released in 1997. It featured Jon Pertwee, Nicholas Courtney, Richard Franklin, John Levene, and Christopher Barry returning to Aldbourne and reminiscing about the filming of The Dæmons.Due to the proliferation of independent video productions in the early 1990s featuring characters from the Doctor Who franchise, and the involvement of several actors recently seen in such productions, Return to Devil's End is occasionally listed in error as a dramatic spin-off production a la RP: Wartime.",
