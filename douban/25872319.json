    "introduction": "Madame Tussauds will disagree, but some folks believe that having a wax figure made out of yourself before you die is bad luck, a notion that is explored in Hong Hoon (ห้องหุ่น, a.k.a. Crack My Skin).The thriller originated as a radio drama by Somsuk Kaljaruek, and was remade for TV a few times. Now it's a movie by Kantana Motion Pictures, a newly launched production shingle of the Kaljareuk clan's Kantana Group, an entertainment company better known for its soap operas and post-production work on most of the movies released in Thailand and around the region.The director is Kulp Kaljareuk, grandson of the radio play's writer and son of Kantana Group honcho Jaruek Kaljaruek. He's making his feature directorial debut.Ananda Everingham stars as a guy investigating the death of his sister, which had something to with wax figures. He teams up with a woman named Ploy (Rattanarat Aurthaveekul), whose father's death also involved wax figures.The two stars promoted the film at the recent Thailand Comic-Con and also got naked for a photo shoot that went viral on the Internet. Rated 15+",
