No one would guess by the look of him, but Baumschlager manages to get himself romantically tangled with an Israeli female officer as well as a Lebanese virgin, all while having a good wife back in Austria. Never means harm, Baumschlager simply wants to please everyone around him. But as his actions set motion to a local drug dealer with a risky blackmail, Baumschlager may very much be the end of peace in the Middle East.",
