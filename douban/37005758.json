    "introduction": "“Oh! Dear me, the mystery of life.” A woman notices an unusual stain on the wall of their house. As she wonders what could have caused it, her mind takes her on an imaginary history of the house and its past residents. Writer and director Anderson Wright does justice to Virginia Woolf’s eponymous short story in this wonderfully shot short film.根据伍尔夫的短篇小说《墙上的斑点》为依据，导演兼编剧创作了同名短片。",
