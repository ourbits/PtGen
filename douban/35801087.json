    "introduction": "Adam Ondra is the best. Born in 1993, the Czech climber has broken a series of records and is widely recognised as the most accomplished in his discipline. No mountain or wall can resist him. But who is this young man who knows no fear, and doesn't seem to encounter failed attempts? Peter Zaruba delivers an intimate portrait, beyond the usual sensationalism of sports headlines.",
