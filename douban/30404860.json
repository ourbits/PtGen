    "introduction": "Colin Kaepernick, Serena Williams, Simone Biles and Naomi Osaka have all been lauded and vilified for their expression of activism within sports. This documentary tells the story of the original sports activist. The first Black man to win Wimbledon, The US Open and the Australian Open, Ashe dissects his incredible personal journey, in his own words, from singularly-focused tennis player who refused to bow to pressure on what kind of Black man he should be, to his transformation into a militant voice who to this day has an enduring legacy for his work within the Civil Rights Movement, against apartheid in South Africa and for AIDS activism. Citizen Ashe is an uplifting story of one man’s integrity and grace in the face of challenge and obstacle.",
