    "introduction": "PERSONAL COURAGE tells the intimate story of Army veteran, Jeffrey Derma, and his wife, Rebecca Cristina, as their marriage reaches a crossroads. Beginning in the final days of Jeff's military service and continuing through the next two and a half years, the film captures their relationship as they reacclimate to one another and work to reestablish what it means to live life together, as a family. From eager anticipation, to naive optimism, from inner turmoil to a love rooted in patience and respect, Jeff and Rebecca take us on their journey with unflinching access. PERSONAL COURAGE captures the trials and triumphs we all face in our lives, powerfully bringing them home through a window into one American family. An inspiring story of pain and grace, love and redemption, PERSONAL COURAGE is a film for anyone who's ever searched for home and a life filled with purpose.",
