    "introduction": "Celia, who calls herself Ginevra, is a movie actress who is appearing in an art-film. When she collapses from exhaustion while browsing in a bookstore and subsequently has a car crash, she decides to run away, throwing away her belongings and attempting to live incognito with a bar singer. Eventually she returns to her oh-so-boring life and shuttles between two additional lovers while working on the set of \"Tears of an Angel.\" Some allusions are made to the Arthurian and Camelot myths, but these are not developed. Reviewers found the main attraction of this \"art film\" to be the numerous sex scenes between the star (played by Amanda Ooms) and her various lovers.",
