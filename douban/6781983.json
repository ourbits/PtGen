    "introduction": "The story of one of the most fascinating monarch figures in contemporary history. Simeon II of Bulgaria, cousin to the House of Windsor and a descendant of William the Conqueror. From his adventurous life as an exiled boy king who became a symbol of hope for a small European country, to his glorious return as Prime Minister of Bulgaria after half a century of Communist dictatorship. His love–hate relationship with people from his “Kingdom” in a film about hope, faith, myths, reality, history, social anthropology and the long journey of democracy back home in Eastern Europe.",
