    "introduction": "OH Tae-kyung, once an up-and-coming actor, starts a YouTube channel as a breakthrough. He starts to produce content where he grants people's wishes, borrowing a concept from the movie “Oldboy”. Becoming a flop, and close to becoming just yet another broken toy, one day a subscriber asks him to uncover the story of a man standing alone with a picket sign saying “I haven't done anything yet”. Tae-kyung's insistence and shameless pig-headedness will be a gate to a whole new adventure for us.Besides a great sense of humour, director Park Sang-min has excellent editing skills, taking us on a frenzied journey along the charms of personal internet broadcasting, full of twists and seemingly trivial and empty moves. Masking his filming style with a clumsy streaming tone (such a risk for his first feature film), Park makes the story burst forth full of curious characters, multiple chats, predictable trolls, diverse emojis, multi-screen galore and plenty of stickers, all to bring us closer to the story, all to get more subscribers to the channel.It would be fun if it wasn't almost tragic: the immediate takes the place of the genuine, and the next action erases the previous mistake, the rush of online content. But come on, let it flow, it's hilarious. A funny, although at times serious statement about the YouTube culture (or is it a bubble?). An unexpected comedy where nothing is what it seems.源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/i-havent-done-anything/",
