    "introduction": "After wrapping up an 18-month tour for their third studio album Vide Noir, Lord Huron is teaming up with director Ariel Vida to produce a full-length feature film under the same name. Their cinematic album -- which peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard 200 -- is expanding to a neo-noir mystery film set in the 1960s in LA. The nighttime movie stars Victor Mascitelli as Buck Vernon and Ashleigh Cummings (The Goldfinch) as his fiancée Lee Green and is captured \"through the lens of a space-and-time-bending drug,\" according to the press release. It was written by Lord Huron's founder Ben Schneider as the final chapter of the band's Vide Noir album, appropriately titled after the French phrase for \"black void.\" Lord Huron will score the film with new arrangements of their music. The mystery flick has elements of romance as it chronicles Vernon's search for his missing fiancée, after she left Detroit for what Vernon assumes to be her wild pursuit out west to become a singer. But his strange, surreal encounters -- which take him from a fortune teller's parlor to a dark, broody forest -- leads him to a new drug infiltrating town and brings him face-to-face with its mysterious creator.",
