    "introduction": "In 2012, Crundwell was arrested as the largest municipal fraud perpetrator in the nation's history, embezzling upwards of $50 million as the comptroller and treasurer of Dixon, a city in the heart of Illinois. Rita Crundwell became one of the nation's leading quarter horse breeders, traveled the world, and threw lavish parties, all while forcing staff cuts, police budget slashing, and leaving public infrastructure in disrepair. All the Queen's Horses aims to illuminate this landmark case and bring to light the blatant negligence of auditors and bankers the public relied on to keep their tax dollars safe.",
