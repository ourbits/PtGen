But a debate is raised as the local farm animals believe the dam will catapult their small country town into the 21st Century. With both sides standing their ground, it is up to Dot to lend a helping hand, despite opposition from local detectives Sherlock Bones and Watson the cat.A unique blend of live action photography and cel animation from award-winning filmmaker Yoram Gross (Blinky Bill) featuring a string of lively musical numbers, Dot and The Koala is a thoughtful ecological journey into Australian rural wonderland.",
