Under pressure from his boss and seeking to get closer to his estranged daughter, Margitta, Kerber investigates the case of a missing girl from Margitta's school. Hoping to land the big story about \"the East's lost generation\", he is more and more confronted with his own past. But he ignores all the warning signs. Instead, he begins to manipulate the story.",
