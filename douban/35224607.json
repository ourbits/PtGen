    "introduction": "In 1952 Rose Miller returns to her rural hometown of Beresford, South Dakota to care for her ailing mother. Once there, she falls in love with a deaf man and must decide if she has the courage to follow her heart. Wild Prairie Rose is an examination of the changing roles of women in 1950s America and in the ways that people who have great differences can learn to communicate with one another. It is a film that focuses on one woman's story, and yet challenges the audience to examine their own assumptions about what makes a good life.",
