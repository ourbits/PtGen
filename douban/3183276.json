    "introduction": "The emotional dilemmas of two sisters and their families sets the stage for the French drama Plus Qu'hier Moins Que Demain. Francoise (Laetitia Legrix) is a teenager who has grown tired of her hometown and her parents, while her older sister Sonia (Mireille Roussel) has come back home, with husband and child in tow. Sonia's unresolved issues with her family, including a relationship with her uncle that ended badly, trigger bouts of depression that previously led to a suicide attempt. Francoise, on the other hand, has fallen in love with her cousin Bernard (Pascal Cervo), whose father is the man who once loved Sonia and betrayed her father. Plus Qu'hier Moins Que Demain was shown at the 1999 Rotterdam Film Festival, where it won the Tiger Award in the New Director competition. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide",
