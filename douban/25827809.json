    "introduction": "Dave, a 24-year-old ordinary kiwi slacker, finds his life turned upside down when he meets the girl of his dreams Cara - and her three kids. Step Dave is a light-hearted, feel-good family drama which demonstrates one of the realities of modern life that families come in all different shapes and sizes. In this series, home is where the heart is even if that home is crammed full of kids, teenagers, ex-mother-in-laws and hangers-on. Can this unconventional relationship survive the age difference and the pressures of the multi-generational household? Can Dave step up (no pun intended) and be a proper parent? Should he even try to? Can this unruly bunch live happily ever after as one big happy family?",
