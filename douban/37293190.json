    "introduction": "When her mother decides to sell their house, decolonial writer and academic Julietta Singh begins to listen to the stories embedded in the walls of her expansive childhood home on the Red River in Manitoba. In doing so, she uncovers a rich tapestry of captivating women’s histories that span 140 years. Through the stories of these forgotten women—Japanese, Deaf, Métis, Indigenous, Irish—the film creatively links Singh’s challenging upbringing in the home to a rich legacy of activists and matriarchs. Playing with the various metaphorical meanings of nest—as both a place of refuge and nurturing and as the concept of one thing nestled within another—Singh guides us through the generations while simultaneously reflecting on her mother’s life and political convictions. Ultimately, The Nest challenges patriarchy by building feminist alliances that go beyond identities, generations and centuries.",
