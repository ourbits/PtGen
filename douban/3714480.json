    "introduction": "In his second feature, director Michel Khleifi tells the story of two Palestinian lovers, now in their forties. Two decades after being forced apart by the 1967 war, they are reunited in Jerusalem, in the midst of the Intifada.  Lyrically blending fact and fiction, Canticle of the Stones juxtaposes the nostalgic dialogue of the long-lost lovers with verité documentation of the popular struggle unfolding on the streets of Palestine. Against a backdrop of resistance and repression, they fall in love again.",
