Her wedding to a former tennis champion-turned-successful entrepreneur fast approaching, Chloe laments the fact that she doesn't have a father to walk her down the aisle. Little does she realize that not one but two men are determined to prove they are her one and only father: Wealthy Bernard has a bad case of OCD, and destitute Gus is a generous man but a hopeless drunk. Meanwhile, on the eve of Chloe's wedding, the anxious bride finds a third candidate who appears to be the perfect man for the job.",
