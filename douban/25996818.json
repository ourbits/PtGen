    "introduction": "Echo of the Mountain presents a look into the life and work of Santos de la Torre, a great Huichol artist who, like his people, lives in oblivion. Ironically, one of Santos' murals was selected by then-President Ernesto Zedillo to represent Mexican culture in a privileged location in Paris. The artist was never paid for his work. We will follow Santos during his pilgrimage to Wirikuta, where he will ask the gods' for permission to create a new mural. This new mural will portray the history, mythology, and religious practices of the Huichol people. We will take the audience on a journey across 385 miles of the \"Peyote Route,\" which is in danger of disappearing unless it receives the protection of UNESCO.",
