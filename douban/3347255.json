    "introduction": "Pretty singer/actress Marie Coleby has a charmed,affluent life in Sydney. She lives alone in a beach-side mansion with her dog and doting neighbour, old Billy Shepherd helps her out from time to time. The bearded Gordon Mason is her gardener. He is a psycho,who enjoys lying in bed with a mannequin and dreaming about torturing women on the beach. His obsession with Marie leads to rape and murder. A new resident enters the house of murder. Marie's older sister Jenny Nolan is looking for her...\"Lady Stay Dead\" is a sleazy psycho slasher comparable to \"Maniac\", \"Don't Go in the House\", \"Never Pick Up a Stranger\" or \"American Nightmatre\". There is plenty of sleaze and full-frontal nudity as well as some brutal violence. Chard Hayward is perfect as a appropriately perverted and crazed murderer.",
