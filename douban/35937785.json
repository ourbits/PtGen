    "introduction": "Flora. Nature delights and terrifies her. Nature is a physical experience. To observe it is insufficient. Flora will write a poem. Maria Pawlikowska-Jasnorzewska (1891–1945) is known mainly for her subtle erotica and talent for gentle observation. (Flora exit) reveals the untamed and unapologetic face of this true artist of life.",
