    "introduction": "American EDWARD BAKER (Harvey Keitel) has run a secular boarding school in India for more than 30 years. Lately, pressures have been mounting – the school is broke, religious militants are violently pushing back against Christians, and the school's LANDLORD wants to appropriate the school property and sell the land to a car company looking to build a factory. Headstrong Indian student VARUN (Ayush Khedekar from \"Slumdog Millionaire\"), who comes from a dysfunctional family, builds an unlikely relationship with Baker and unwittingly sets into motion a series of events with far reaching consequences.Gandhi of the Month is a progressive drama about the after affects of globalization and religious intolerance at one level and is also a sensitive look at the affecting relationship status between a principal and his troubled student.",
