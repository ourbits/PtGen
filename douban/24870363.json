    "introduction": "Malika´s double life as a call-centre operator by day and the uninhibited leader of a punk-rock band in Tangiers´ ancient casbah by night takes an unexpected turn when the young woman has to find the money to direct a music video that will be her band´s ticket to fame and fortune. Unfortunately, Malika looks in all the wrong places and finds herself definitely out of her depth; she´s going to need to rely on much more than her talent and her femininity to get herself out of this mess. Splendid debut by a young American actor and producer (a revelation in the first \"short\" by his best buddy Darren Aronofsky) who has lived in Tangiers for years, this is a heart-stopping thriller that reveals all the contradictions of Moroccan culture today. All the songs in the film are sung by its star Chaimae Ben Acha",
