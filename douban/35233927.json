    "introduction": "Decadence is a cyclical circumstance moving with the turns of the centuries. Following a four-season study of glamour in the millennial age, the Spring-Summer 2019 Artisanal collection marks a new investigation for Maison Margiela. Observing the excess and artifice engendered by the digital world, creative director John Galliano ventures into a new era of decadence. The overstimulation of computer-generated imagery alters reality and degenerates the truth. Chaotic and unsettling, it is a confusion of the senses rooted in an over-satiation that inevitably overspills. For the generations born around the millennium, it breeds a spirit of le malaise de la fin du siècle. Revolution: a desire for change. Maison Margiela renders the decadence of our time and examines if inverted excess could lead to a new appetite for restraint.",
