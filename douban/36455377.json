    "introduction": "After the revolution of 1956, hundreds of thousands of Hungarians left their home country to escape political retaliation and Soviet oppression. Most of them ended up in Austrian refugee camps, and nations all around the world started collecting donations and finding various ways to help them. The stories of Hungarians who moved to the USA, the UK, Sweden and to other European countries are well known - but only a few people have heard that at Christmas 1956, a small Nordic country, Iceland also took part in the rescue mission. On a Red Cross airplane, 52 Hungarians arrived in Reykjavík at the end of the year. The film \"Shelter in the North\" tells their story, with the help of witnesses and historians, also showing how the rebellion out in distant Budapest was perceived in Iceland and why was it an important issue for Icelanders at the time.",
