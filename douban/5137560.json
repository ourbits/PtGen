    "introduction": "This documentary tells a story of a taxidermist, who lives and works in a Venice-like wild place in southern Ukraine by the Black Sea.He stuffs birds and fish and then donates his work to local museums. It is his self expression in this weird art form, if we can call it so.The film is very simple, has no narration and shows straight forward encounter with this weird taxidermist who loves what he does.There is very little of dialogue, we see it all happen in this amazingly filmed landscape.The fascinating point about this documentary is its simplicity, but in the same time the film is poetic and metaphoric.",
