    "introduction": "It’s 2003, four years before Slovakia becomes part of the Schengen Area. Today the border with Ukraine is one of Europe’s best guarded, but then it was the playground of smugglers and human traffickers. Martin and Denisija dream of leaving Ukraine for Germany to begin a new life. Crossing the border brings unexpected complications, but the pair are willing to sacrifice a great deal to reach their destination. Atlantis, 2003 provides a chilling excursion to a recent past we should not forget, but it also asks a universal question: How responsible are we for each other?",
