    "introduction": "An impressive feature-length documentary that takes an exclusive look at the vast global effort to research, develop, regulate, and market Covid-19 vaccines in the war against the global pandemic. The film begins in early 2020, when the coronavirus crossed all borders, and follows researchers in their laboratories, as they conduct tests with millions of volunteers and regulators in quarantine offices as deaths rise and political pressure becomes brutal. Continuing throughout 2021, as vaccines show promise, the film describes the stumbling blocks, intense controversy, and systemic injustices that threaten to leave most of the world begging for vaccines – and watching helplessly as more deadly variants develop. With unparalleled access to the most prominent figures in this colossal endeavor, from bench scientists to large pharmaceutical companies, government agencies, and front-line workers, this is the historic timeline of the most endearing endeavor of our lives, where vast achievements in science clash with realities of despair, greed, and nationalism.",
