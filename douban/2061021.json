    "introduction": "Once upon a time, there lived a beautiful Princess. One day she met a handsome Movie Star. The two fell in love, married and set off to create their very own Fairytale. We get a glimpse into their life with their blended brood of five children. First we have Oxenberg's daughter princess-in-training India; then Van Dien's children from his first marriage, Cappy and Gracie; and the couple's two children together, Maya \"the little Napoleon\" and baby Celeste. The series captures some scenes familiar to every family, such as getting the kids to bed on time or enforcing discipline. Other scenes are not-so-ordinary because, even in a fairytale, trouble brews and thorny issues erupt. Viewers will see long-simmering resentments and lighthearted moments. \"When the crown comes off and the limos roll away, it's just us--diapers and all,\" said Van Dien. \"At home we're a very open and uninhibited family. But between the demands of Hollywood, parenthood and royalty, you can never predict what will happen next,\"he said. Oxenberg added,\"We love being parents, and we're willing to try different ideas to make it all work. Fortunately, humor is our saving grace!\" Written by Manager",
