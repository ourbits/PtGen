With its magnificent mountains, glacial valleys and 16 iconic lakes and meres, the Lake District is one of the great natural wonders of our country.But huge changes are sweeping through this ancient landscape. In this episode, Simon meets some of the Cumbrian characters with different visions for the future of England’s biggest national park, including a campaign group trying to protect the remaining red squirrel populations, a traditional farmer who feels that his ancient way of life is on the point of extinction and an 18-year-old student who, following the recent deaths of both parents, now runs a 1500-acre farm.",
