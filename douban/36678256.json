    "introduction": "Lucy and Sara are sisters. They're what some people might call recluse. They've been putting up with each other by the skin of their teeth for years. But with the passing of their father, things must change whether they like it or not.In their first on-camera interviews, Sara echoes their father's final plea for them to \"look after each other”. Then in a maudlin bout of loneliness, in a dramatic cry for attention she threatens to kill herself. Sick of the manipulation, Lucy makes a plan to scare Sara straight which then backfires.Oddly codependent yet never truly close, the sisters delve further into the unconventional ways they are forced to lean on each other as we get to know them.源自：https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/films/2196808",
