    "introduction": "Escape Into Night is a six part British television serial for children made by ATV for ITV that aired from April 19, 1972 to May 24, 1972. It was directed by Richard Bramall.The serial was an adaptation of Catherine Storr's novel Marianne Dreams, and deals with a young girl, Marianne, whose drawings become the basis for dreams, and how the dividing line between dreams and reality blurs. The novel was later adapted into a 1988 film, Paperhouse.The series was made in colour, but the colour masters are missing; only a black and white telerecording of the series exists. These surviving recordings were released in the UK by Network DVD in May 2009.For its theme music, 'Escape Into Night' used a segment of the third movement of the Symphony No.6 in E minor by Ralph Vaughan Williams.",
