    "introduction": "The Sami are spread over four countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. They have no state of their own, they speak nine different languages, and they are Europe’s last aboriginal people. The directors return to them 25 years after Mies jolla on kahdet kasvot and Skierri, but a lot has changed in the meantime. The protagonists share their experience of forgotten traditional ways of living and survival in a globalised economy. Among them are Nils Gaup, who made the first film in the Sami language, and Mikkâl Morottaja, the first Sami rap musician. Perhaps art could unite and maintain the culture.源自：https://doclisboa.org/2023/en/filmes/the-sami/",
