Indigo Brown, a celebrity make-up artist trying to escape her past and a tumultuous relationship in LA, moves in with her spirited foster sister, Amber, in Washington D.C desperate for a fresh start. While blind to her own drinking problems, Indigo learns about her estranged mother's issues with addiction and struggles with love during the 60's and 70's through the pages of an old journal. With the help of Damien, a gallant stranger turned confidant who fights to win Indigo's heart, she gains the strength to not relive the mistakes of her mother's past and finally embrace the possibility of true love in her future.",
