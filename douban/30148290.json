    "introduction": "Can a critical reflection of a war be achieved for example by means of poeticity or visuality, or would it be advisable in such an undertaking to tendentially forego unambiguous words and images in favour of a more critical reflection of a war? If a text or a film was made in such a way as to seem to lack reference to reality, would it then make finding the truth redundant, since no reference points to factuality – the atrocities, for instance – could be found? Or would such a design of a text or a film allow conclusions about the problematic nature of any attempt at describing, at showing the complexity of evil?",
