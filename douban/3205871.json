    "introduction": "Dull movie from golden age of science fictionThis movie was made during the golden era of science fiction, when characters and scenery were so much better than today's garbage. This movie doesn't fit the bill, however. It will probably be most appreciated by those who like movies made after 1970. There is an invader from space. he is very dull, and so are the characters looking for him, mostly arrogant detectives. None of them get our attention, even in a satirical way. Unlike most older science fiction, this movie just plods on and on, with mostly city shots of cars, buildings, offices, the same hum drum people see every day, and with nothing of interest to add onto these sets. Even the heroine is plain looking.If you like the ho hum dull plodding method of modern movies, you may like this. Otherwise, avoid, and watch a good older science fiction, which includes most of the others.",
