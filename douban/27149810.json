    "introduction": "The Russian Revolution of 1917 is one of the most controversial events of the 20th century. Three men - Lenin, Trotsky, Stalin - emerged from obscurity to forge an entirely new political system. In the space of six months they turned the largest country on earth into the first Communist state. Was this a triumph of people power or a coup d’etat that led to blood-soaked totalitarianism? A hundred years later, the Revolution still sparks ferocious debate. In this documentary, writers and historians, including Martin Amis, Orlando Figes, Helen Rappaport, Simon Sebag-Montefiore and China Miéville, battle over the meaning of the Russian Revolution and spell out how it shapes the world we live in today",
