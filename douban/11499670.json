    "introduction": "Something unusual happened in the bird colony: an alarm-clock hatched from the egg of one bird. Everything would have been all right if the alarm-clock had not broken one day: it neither ticked nor rang anymore. The mother searched in vain through the whole forest and neighbourhood — nobody knew how to repair the alarm clock. Finally, the problem was solved by a woodpecker: from the clock he removed — a maggot! The clock ticked and rang again to the great delight of its mother and the whole flock of birds.",
