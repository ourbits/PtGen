    "introduction": "The daughter of a Mexican beauty queen attempts to become a Hollywood star as she struggles against aging and her own mothers unaccomplished dreams. As a child Ana was trained to become famous, beautiful and everlasting young. \"Us women become invisible the minute we turn 40\" was her demanding mother's expression that now echoes in her mind while time continues to fly by, the working visa expires, and drug and gender free love transform the perception she acknowledges about herself. In the pursuit of a leading role that would allow her to succeed in Hollywood, she realizes that her life has been ruled by appearances. Will she find herself. Will she become invisible, or will Ana finally accept that she resembles her mother more than she would like to admit?",
