    "introduction": "Morir de Amor is a charming little tale. It's a story that focuses on two caged parrots reminiscing of memories past as their owner sleeps nearby. A rather important memory that the owner was not privy to. While the beginning starts out rather ho hum it quickly recovers with its quirky charm, humor, and rather subtly becomes rather poignant as the story nears completion.",
