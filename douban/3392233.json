He intends his brother, Catalano, to be used to kill him. The daughter of the king, Vejmelkova is in love with Hoesl. When the brothers get the three gold contract plumes of a mythical bird to get, says Catalano against the king that he must return only. Hoesl will, however, the peacock feather a princess who must save him for mischief. Cute fairy tale movie made by the magnificent design that even adults will be fun to experience. The scenario of Weigl is predictable, but the simple yet colorful mise-en-scene reimburse much. Brilliant photography by Richard Valenta.",
