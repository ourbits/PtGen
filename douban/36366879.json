When his chance to conduct his masterpiece on a world-wide live stream is snatched away by celeb conductor Walter Paisley, he and a pair of child prodigies set up their own orchestra in a ruined mansion and, as the Covid crisis takes over the country, begin luring - and eventually abducting - young musicians to create a musical Eden in the wilderness. But things go horribly wrong.",
