    "introduction": "There is no great director in the hall of fame who does not have a shattered dream, a great film dreamt of and never realized: Fellini, Visconti, Pasolini, Leone and many others. How could it happen that even important artists had to give up their great dream? Our story is the first chapter of a \"cinematheque of broken dreams\". A docufilm that recounts through unpublished sketches, archives and interviews all the reasons why a great film project can fail: from budget problems to the risk of being ahead of the times; from the art of knowing how to self-sabotage; to the inability to find the right interlocutors; from personal problems to the innate tendency not to know how to seize the moment.",
