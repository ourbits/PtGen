    "introduction": "Moving Picture (946-3) Kyoto Version consists of a film, made in collaboration with Corinna Belz, projected at a monumental scale, spanning over 7 meters (more than 23 feet) wide and accompanied by a score for trumpet composed by Rebecca Saunders and recorded by Marco Blaauw and Sebastian Schottke. Ten speakers surround the viewer, giving a physical force and presence to the music. Previously, Richter’s experimentations in combining image and sound into immersive experiences have resulted in temporary works at the Manchester International Festival (in 2015, with Arvo Pärt) and The Shed, New York (in 2019, with Pärt and Steve Reich).",
