    "introduction": "In 2010 I embarked on a mission to find out the truth behind the rumor that Gustaf Eiffel came to San Jose and secretly stole the plans of the San Jose Light Tower to build his Eiffel Tower.  As ridiculous as it sounds, often there is an element of truth to good rumors. In fact, you will discover that it was not Eiffel who came to visit San Jose but rather the Baron de Rothschild!The result of my many years of research is the film documentary “The Light Between Two Towers” that describes the events of the period and the people involved in the design and building of the San Jose Light Tower (1881) and the Eiffel Tower (1889). It turns out there is a rather dramatic and compelling relationship that enables San Joseans to rightfully proclaim that the Eiffel Tower drew its inspiration from the San Jose Light Tower built in 1881.",
