    "introduction": "After a week I don't remember much about this film. A sad young woman wanders around. Sometimes she holds a cat. It does have a mood of melancholy.This film was inspired by a poem. (I think it is a poem by Garcia-Lorca.) Lines of the poem are used as intertitles. I am unfamiliar with the poem so much of this film is lost on me. I should see it again. I think it is probably one of the more interesting of Cornell's films. -- John C., Film NotesThe films of the reclusive artist Joseph Cornell (1903-1972) are as unique as his famous box constructions. Though rarely exhibited during his lifetime, these mysterious works nonetheless have had a deep and lasting influence on the world of avant-garde filmmaking . His entire body of film numbers some thirty-odd works, encompassing the incomplete and the fragmentary. It can be said that Cornell made two kinds of films in two distinct periods of activity: collage films, made by recombining found materials, and directed films,where he worked with cinematographers (including Stan Brakhage, Rudy Burckhardt and Larry Jordan) to document his fantasy/experience of wandering in New York. -Bradley Eros and Jeanne Liotta",
