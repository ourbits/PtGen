    "introduction": "这是乐坛常青树Bee Gees乐队的纪录片。全长2小时的纪录片通过采访，照片，家庭录像，现场表演等详细的介绍了Gibb兄弟3人的家庭情况，成长环境，乐坛发展道路，创作过程，等。There have been a lot of durable family groups in popular music over the years, but it would be hard to name one that has lasted longer, and succeeded as consistently, as the Bee Gees. Barry Gibb and his younger twin brothers, Robin and Maurice, were making TV and radio appearances in Australia as early as 1960 before returning to their native England and joining the Beatles-led British Invasion, and they're still at it more than 40 years later. All of that is duly chronicled in this two-hour documentary (produced in 2000), along with a great deal more: the personal problems that led to a breakup in the early '70s; the unparalleled success of the Saturday Night Fever era; their occasional missteps and failures (e.g., the abominable Sgt. Pepper movie); the rise and tragic fall of brother Andy; the respect their success finally earned them in the '90s; and so on.",
