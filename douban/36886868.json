    "introduction": "Legendary historical heroes continue to shape our culture and everyday life but are these fabulous tales fact or fiction ? We set out to find the answers. In this three-part documentary series, we search for the truth behind some of history’s most iconic and celebrated heroes.In the first episode, we start with Noah, chosen by God to survive the catastrophic flood alongside his family and an ark full of animal couples. The second episode asks if King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table really existed. In the final episode, we explore the Nibelungen saga and consider whether the medieval epic deals only with the heroic deeds of Siegfried the Dragon Slayer – or whether the tale also provides a fresh perspective on the role of women in the Middle Ages.Episode 1: Noah and the FloodEpisode 2: Siegfried, Kriemhild and the NibelungsEpisode 3: King ArthurProduced by NFP* for ZDF in association with Arte and ZDF Studios",
