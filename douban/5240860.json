    "introduction": "people who all end up at this diner when the road washes away, and they find themselves in the presence of a man who calls himself Jesus. \"it's set in the vein of that John Cussak movie Identity - it's a faith mystery thriller\" - David A.R. WhiteIt’s a Twilight Zone-ish tale about a disparate group of travelers who find themselves stranded in a lonely roadside diner with someone who claims to be Jesus Christ. It was a challenging screenplay on a number of levels.  Although Tim and I are both Christians and we have written a number of faith-based films, it is always intimidating to put words in Jesus’ mouth.  It was also challenging on a technical level.  Eighty-percent of the film consists of six people interacting in a single location.  It’s hard to keep something like that moving.  It should be very interesting. - \"Sean Paul Murphy\"",
