    "introduction": "This was part of the 2nd season of \"American Film Theater\" - producer Ely Landau's idea of filming plays and showing them in theatres for only 2 days and nights and you had to buy tickets in advance a la a night at the theater or a concert . . . I believe they sold tickets at the door only if there were any left (much like theater or concerts)The first season included the likes of \"The Iceman Cometh\", and \"The Man in The Glass Booth\" and \"The Maids\" were among the 2nd season. This was an interesting idea but I'm sure it was unsuccessful. It seems that these pictures have vanished since their original brief theatrical release.\"The Maids\" played in US theatres in February 1975",
