    "introduction": "Many of Pina Bausch's works have been known for their sombre themes of human struggles with alienation and angst. Walzer, a lesser-known but precious performance film, is one of the lightest and \"approachable\" ones with its bouts of absurdity and humour. An example of Pina’s \"sunny period,\" which seemed to coincide with the birth of her son.",
