    "introduction": "The airplane has changed our world, but do we really understand exactly how much? LIVING IN THE AGE OF AIRPLANES reminds us how profoun dly this amazing invention has changed the way we do just about everything. It also renews our appreciation for the airplane and stunningly conveys the wonder and grandeur of flying.Not that long ago, traveling between continents was a migration. Now, on any given day, 100,000 flights transport people and products between any two points on Earth in a matter of hours. Indeed, the airplane may be the closest thing we have to a time machine.Filmed in 18 countries across all 7 continents, the film explores the countless ways the airplane affects our lives (even when we don’t fly). With a fascinating take on history, breathtaking visuals, soaring music, and a truly unique perspective, LIVING IN THE AGE OF AIRPLANES shows the airplane in a fresh light as it takes audiences on a wondrous trip around the globe.LIVING IN THE AGE OF AIRPLANES was produced and directed by Brian J. Terwilliger (One Six Right), is narrated by Harrison Ford, and features an original score by Academy Award® winning composer James Horner (Avatar, Titanic).",
