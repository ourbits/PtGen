    "introduction": "The film is the story of the repercussions that have happened to a boy - a child artist who once played girl roles in films as Baby Kusum - once he becomes an adult and wants to be launched as a hero. Baby Kusum is a child star, a cute little girl. In reality, Baby Kusum is a boy, masquerading as a girl. He was named Jerry, and then renamed Master Jai for the movies. He and his mother Mary (Lilette) share a turbulent relationship. The boy’s family is poor and they want to make it big. The pressure of parents and ridicule make it a very sad situation for him. He becomes a drug-abuser who has never been to school and spends all his time at home. Eventually he creates an imaginary character he is in love with named Nandini [Bipasha Basu] who taunts him, fights with him, and questions his every move. Jerry is made to face the camera again as a young man, which leads to the final catastrophe. The film highlights the common practice in the Indian film industry of casting children in role contrary to their natural genders.",
