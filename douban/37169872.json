    "introduction": "Trapped in airport limbo, Sara struggles with mounting stress and uncertainty across multiple aspects of her life she can't control. A missed call spirals Sara into distress. She knows what the call is but can't bring herself to return it. For the reason being that if she did, her greatest fear would be confirmed as true. She's stuck in an airport due to her flight being delayed multiple times. Her inner world is crumbling. A projected unyielding panic overwhelms her as she tries to find a solution to get home. Can't anybody help her? A small gesture from a woman who works for the airline takes Sara to a lounge where an unlikely stranger becomes the confessional she didn't know she needed. SARA is an intimate short film about a woman who finds the strength to confront a cancer diagnosis by relying on the comfort of strangers.",
