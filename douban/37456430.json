    "introduction": "In the 1990s, a child grows up surrounded by deep secrets. The men in his family, his father included, die too young, but he is too young to understand why. When he learns that his surname ‘brands’ him in the eyes of everyone in his city, he gets the feeling that it’s his own life he sees in the gangster and horror movies he loves to watch; they reflect the violence that changed his existence. And it is precisely through cinema that, once a man, he starts investigating his past and reconstructing his own identity.",
