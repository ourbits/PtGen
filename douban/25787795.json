    "introduction": "In this case, Matta-Clark obtained permission to use a typical two-story, red-shingled house at 349 Erie Avenue in Niagara Falls, New York. He had ten days to complete the project, which involved dividing one side of the house into nine equal five-foot by nine-foot sections. Eight segments were removed, leaving the center of the grid intact. Originally titled “Been-Gone by Ninth,” Matta-Clark ended up changing the title to Bingo X Ninths in reference to the game’s grid.",
