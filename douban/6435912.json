    "introduction": "From age six, child prodigy painter Declan Truss is propelled into the art world as a rare marvel, but by seventeen, a chemical imbalance and the tightrope of notoriety are catching up with him. He starts to see his family as the source of his suppression. The immense pressures of an impending coming-of-age exhibition loom as Declan seeks out inspiration. His world expands when he meets a group of rebellious freethinkers in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Falling in love, Declan slips off his medication, quickly spinning out of control, while magnetizing the Brooklyn rebels to join his progressively subversive showcase.",
