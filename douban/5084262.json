    "introduction": "The year 2011. The world is torn apart by war, violence and other misery. The Nuke has been dropped and the world is a desolate place where chaos and anarchy rules. A grown man with the mind of a child lived all those years locked securely in a bunker and when an automatic time slot suddenly opens he is coming into a world where he knows nothing about. “The Afterman” is soon confronted with violent and perverse survivors. He is, together with an anxious wife, locked up at a local slave driver. However, they can both escape, and slowly but surely, something beautiful blossoms between the two. But is there room for love and happiness (read: sex) in this savage new world? This film is a cult-movie with no dialogue.",
