    "introduction": "The HungarofuturistManifesto was published in 2017. The artists' movement behind the proclamation, which took its inspiration from Afrofuturism, arose as a response to the sustained assault on the freedom of the press, the autonomy of scientific thought, civil initiatives and cultural institutions mounted by the FIDESZ regime under Viktor Orbán. Poet MárióZ. Nemes is an active member of this movement – his poemBarokkFeminaserves as the template for PéterLichter'sfilm of the same name. Blending archival materials, news footage, Hollywood edits and video game fragments into a multi-layered, Dadaist collage, Lichter's experimental work offers viewers a glimpse into Hungary's \"collective unconscious\".",
