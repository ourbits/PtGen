    "introduction": "Steven Callahan gives a gripping first-hand account of his NYT bestselling novel \"Adrift: 76 Days Lost At Sea.\" On the eve of February 4, 1982, in the middle of the night there was a loud boom as a whale collided with Steven's boat. Within minutes, his small craft was flooded with a rush of water. He grabbed what he could, heaved his life raft into the ocean, and snatched his emergency kit. Without food or water, for an incredible 76 days the inflatable raft was his home as he drifted across the entire Atlantic Ocean. Forced to come to terms with his own shortcomings and limitations, Steven finds a strength he never knew he had. This official documentary, executive produced by Callahan, brings the story to life with found 8MM footage, original stills of the time of the voyage, and first-person recreation. Still possessing many of the original artifacts, he takes us step-by-step through his harrowing and life-altering adventure.",
