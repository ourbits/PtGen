Gregoire may be wealthy, but he is many years older and several pounds heavier than his young wife, who's beauty makes all the male holiday guests turn their necks. Baron Plessen falls in love with Lola, and she quickly gets fond of the idea of replacing her corpulent husband with a handsome nobleman. Together, they plan to push Gregoire out of the picture.",
