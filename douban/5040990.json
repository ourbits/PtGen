Among the students is the young and restless Shingo Tamai, a first year student. At the beginning of the school year he presents the new coach of the soccer team, Tenpei Matsuki, whom was also a former goalkeeper of the Japanese national football and bronze medal winner at the Olympic Games in Mexico. Matsuki intends to build a team that can compete at the highest levels. His intense workouts originally seems too much for many members of the team, including Shingo. He decides to boycott the team's \"official\" Matsuki team and creates his own. After a first victory, he is always defeated by that of Matsuki, which begins to be seen by Shingo as an invincible enemy. Subsequently, the two will be able to clarify their conflicting relationship and Shingo will eventually become the captain of the only school team coached by Matsuki.",
