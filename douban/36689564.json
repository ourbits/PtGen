    "introduction": "The outskirts of a big city: council houses, a stadium, a prison, a Roma camp awaiting redevelopment. The everyday life of a group of friends is abruptly interrupted by the rape of Alessandra, 16. It was her cousin’s boyfriend, but the blame immediately falls on the Roma boys.The news spreads through the crisis-stricken neighbourhood. Investigations overwhelm the teenagers. Organised crime manipulates popular indignation for economic and political interests. By the time Alessandra finds the strength to oppose it, the Roma camp has already been set on fire by a rioting mob.",
