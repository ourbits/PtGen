    "introduction": "本片由前南著名女演员Mira Stupica主演，她被公认为20世纪南斯拉夫影史上最伟大的女演员，曾3次获得普拉电影节最佳女主角奖，一次德国电影杰出个人成就奖，2007年获南斯拉夫电影终身成就奖，在2000年Vecernje novosti杂志评选的20世纪南斯拉夫最佳男女演员的名单中她排在首位。The war wind has passed, leaving permanent distortions in human minds. Two brothers, tough warriors, return after the liberation in their village, burnt and deserted. They confess to each other they brought machine guns along from the war, as a trophy. And again, back to shooting, the game they know and love. A German with distorted mind, who was left behind in rocky grounds after the village destruction, joins them. The three of them die in that crazy game.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mi%C4%87a_Popovi%C4%87Miodrag Popovic (1923-1996) was a Serbian painter and experimental filmmaker. He was born on 12 June 1923 in Loznica. He finished grammar school in Belgrade. After the Second World War, most of which he spent in Belgrade working at odd jobs, he enrolled the Academy of Fine Arts in Belgrade in 1946, in the class taught by Ivan Tabakovic. Together with Bata Mihajlovic, Petar OmCikus, Mileta Andrejevic, Ljubinka Jovanovic, Kosara Boksan, and Vera Bozickovic, he went to Zadar in 1947 and formed the famous \"Zadar group\". After returning to Belgrade, they were forbidden to return to their university studies, as the authorities viewed the work of the Zadar group as subversive, but sometime later, they were all allowed to return except for Popovic, who continued to study on his own, with the help of Tabakovic.As a painter, Popovic is best known for his informel period (1958-1968) and his \"Scenes Painting\" (slikarstvo prizora) (from 1968). Among the Scenes Paintings, the most famous may be \"May 1, 1985,\" which memorialized events surrounding an alleged attack on a farmer in Kosovo named Djordje Martinovic. He also made several films in the 1960s, two of which (\"Covek iz hrastove sume\" and \"Delije\") were banned by the government for their unacceptable content. Mica Popovic was elected a regular member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1986.",
