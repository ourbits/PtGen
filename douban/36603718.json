    "introduction": "Selected among others at the Architecture and Design Film Festival in New York, Toronto, Vancouver and Chicago, Rehab (from rehab) provides a sensitive and personal reflection on the design of care spaces in hospitals. Through the narrative of her own childhood spent in rehabilitation centers with her severely disabled father, director Louise Lemoine confronts her traumatic memories with the exceptional experimentation conducted at REHAB Basel by Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron. This film explores how well-conceived spaces can contribute to healing, blending architecture, therapy, and compassionate care. Each story, marked by fragility and humanity, creates a striking visual contrast and makes the film intimately touching. Rehab (from rehab) is a delicate work offering a fresh perspective on human vulnerability, masterfully translated into cinematic language.",
