    "introduction": "Griff Rhys Jones stars as bumbling eccentric Max, alongside Ruth Madoc, in a darkly comic tale of love, betrayal and reality television, created by Russell T Davies, the highly acclaimed writer of the TV dramas Bob and Rose, Queer as Folk and The Second Coming.Max Vivaldi doesn't have much in life, but he does have a dream. According to a faded legal document written in the year 1710, his family owns the whole of Swansea. The will has been passed down through twelve generations and is now framed on the living room wall of the Vivaldi household.His neighbours, his friends, even his wife and three children, all laugh at Max whenever he brings up the subject of his inheritance - just as his father and his father before him were ridiculed for their declarations. The Vivaldi claim is a running joke in this picturesque part of the South Wales coast. Max thinks he owns the area where he lives, known as 'the Mumbles', but everyone else thinks it's a load of mumbo jumbo.Until one day his incredible claim is proved to be true.",
