    "introduction": "Director Richard Casey’s (HORROR HOUSE ON HIGHWAY 5) second feature is an ambitious and at times dreamlike Faustian story, set in the rough underworld of LA’s heavy metal and punk music scene. Lemmy (Phil Ward) is the front man for an unsuccessful band, who’s willing to do anything to make it. After a chance meeting with Mr. Tanas, a music promoter, Lemmy is offered the deal of a lifetime: fame for nothing more than his soul. The young singer doesn’t believe in such things and accepts the offer, but quickly learns that this sleazy promoter has more in store for Lemmy than just the stardom he’s dreamed of.\nDirected and photographed like a surreal documentary, and co-starring David Marciano (HOMELAND) and Darcy Nichols (CAFE FLESH), HELLBENT is a blood soaked document of late 80s Los Angeles, as seen through the eyes of outcasts and derelicts.",
