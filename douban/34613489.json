    "introduction": "The movie takes place in a serene vacation home in the Palm Springs desert. A young woman (Wendy McColm) arrives there with her friends, a slightly older married couple (Nora Kirkpatrick and Matt Peters), and the couple are subjecting her to a rather intense version of a blind date: a single man (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett) she's never met will soon be joining them for the weekend. Like any jaded millennial, the woman greets the impending setup with a sense of dread: \"These things never work out!\" she says on the car ride out. But, when her suitor arrives, things don't go quite as expected",
