    "introduction": "This was one of the very first VHS tapes I hunted down. Here we have what I consider the worst film of all time. Not only is it shot on video, but the editing, padding, acting, etc. are absolutely awful. There is no part of this film of any value other than the nostalgia it brings 25 years later. The cover is classic, with Ms. Alden decked out in her nurse outfit lifting a knife with a grin across her face. This is one of the very few slipcases released from Video City Productions (most were released as clamshells) and also bares the awesome “Chop ‘em Ups” logo. But what I find so interesting is that Millard was actually able to find someone to release this thing. Between the title, goofy art, and a reputation for being one of the worst films ever, this is sure to be a great addition to any collection. - See more at:http://www.vhscollector.com/articles/vhscollectorcoms-top-16-most-valuable-us-horror-vhs-part-1#sthash.j4RJ83RW.dpuf",
