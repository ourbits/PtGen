    "introduction": "In tribute to Swedish filmmaker Gunvor Nelson, who passed away in January this year, Olhar de Cinema presents one of her most renowned films, regarded as an important touchstone in American avant-garde cinema of the 1960s and ’70s. In this intimate piece, created with her own daughter, overlapping images, repeated words, and the sonic disintegration of a name evoke the rhythmic experience of childhood – blending dreams, play, and the free exploration of the world.",
