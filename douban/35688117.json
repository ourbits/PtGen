    "introduction": "A couple, a house, an explosive crisis, and two weeks of forced isolation. Marta and Lorenzo are 46 and 49 years old, respectively; they have been a couple for fifteen years and have been married for twelve. Basically, a lifetime. The family doctor has just told them that they must remain in mandatory self-quarantine since Marta came into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Too bad she recently discovered that Lorenzo is having an affair with another woman, Alessia. Marta hates Lorenzo; Lorenzo hates Marta. But they have no choice. They must remain together, locked up in the same 80 square meters for fourteen days. What will they do? A love story in suspended time, for them and for the entire world, in a countdown leading toward a separation. Fourteen chapters, fourteen moments in the life of a couple, and just one, shattered love.",
