    "introduction": "The Eyes of Van Gogh is a story, never told before, of the twelve nightmarish months van Gogh spent in the insane asylum at St. Remy. Through hallucinations, terrifying dreams and wrenching memories, the film tells a tale of magnificent battles: to create - to connect - to love - to change the world. It visualizes the drive and complexity, the heroism and agony of a great artist and a great man. The film explores the theme of an artistic mind in torment, a creative soul in despair, an exquisitely sensitive being ravaged and destroyed by cruelty, wracked by indifference and loneliness, yet desperately seeking to live, to hope, to finish his work, to find a path other than those leading to madness or death.",
