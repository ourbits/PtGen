    "introduction": "It is 1950 in Brest, and the laborers working on the reconstruction of the city, who are on strike, demand better salary conditions. But the police repress the demonstrations with violence, and a young worker, Édouard Mazé, is murdered. Amid the rage and the pain, his comrades P’tit Zef and Désiré receive filmmaker René Vautier, who is summoned by the union to depict the struggles of the labor movement. That is the origin of Un homme est mort, a political documentary whose only print was projected so many times that it got lost forever. Based on the comic book of the same same by Étienne and Kris Davodeau, Un homme est mort constitutes a unique case of metamorphosis—a documentary that turns into struggle, and which, decades later, mutates into a comic book, only to later return to the big screen and constitute itself once more as proof of the political strength cinema is able to achieve.源自：https://www.mardelplatafilmfest.com/38/en/pelicula/un-homme-est-mort",
