    "introduction": "The ever-loyal Yung Ling and her eccentric artist brother Lok Man have to deal with one setback after another when they are forced to collaborate in saving their Indo-Chinese family restaurant Happy Palace from closure, after their father and restaurant owner Chang suddenly dies.Happy Palace is a quirky dramedy in which the persistent clichés in front of and behind the serving hatch of an Indo-Chinese family restaurant are challenged with relish and delight. Written by acclaimed Dutch-Chinese filmmaker Yan Ting YUEN and Ilse OTT, this is a film that Dutch-Asians can most probably relate to, as their personal struggles are largely reflected on screen. However, the film also aims to let the audience walk out of the cinema with hopes for a better tomorrow. It is a funny and optimistic film with serious undertones: the characters’ cultural dilemmas are served to us as one dish after another on a spinning ‘Lazy Susan’.",
