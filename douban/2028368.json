Road was adapted from Jim Cartwright's acclaimed stage play for British television, with glorious results. In a Northern industrial town, young people wander the streets in search of entertainment. Clarke uses Steadicam shots to capture the extended conversations between characters who reside in a community who blighted by economic hardship but still find simple joys in living.http://www.harvardfilmarchive.org/calendars/05_summer/treasures.html",
