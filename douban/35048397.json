    "introduction": "Six Portraits of Pain was born from António Pinho Vargas’ wish to give body to six short poetic essays from Gilles Deleuze, Espinoza, Thomas Bernhard, Manuel Gusmão, Paul Celan and Anna Akhmátova.\"Teresa Villaverde’s work goes far beyond the duplication of Varga’s original musical piece and through the single experience of the silver screen it explores an existential truth that merges with the life form of her imagination and narratives. In its mix of formal austerity and poetic touch, amazes by the cinephile message it carries.\" João Lopes",
