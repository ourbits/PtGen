    "introduction": "To start with, Kitty was not made as a discussion about kitsch. There was just something super-nice about this cat that we were attracted to. But as for Times Square: we were on holiday in separate places when the invite to put a work on the giant screen in Times Square came. But independently, we both had the same idea: why don’t we show the video with the cat. To do something that’s more spectacular than what’s going on in Times Square would be impossible. We wanted to do something very simple and quiet: it was a logical step for us.",
