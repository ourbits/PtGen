After a fight with his father, Horia leaves home on his dad’s motorbike and, soon after, meets street-smart 13-year-old Stela, who is running away from her family. She may be younger than Horia, but she is definitely more adept at living in the moment and adapting to circumstance. And soon, their trip will turn into a full-on adventure that will put their bond to the test.",
