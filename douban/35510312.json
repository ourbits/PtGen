    "introduction": "The picture of a series of seemingly identical houses under the mist of Nizhni Taguil, in that Asian part of Russia that is both beautiful and desolate, shows a city frozen in time and a group of young artists that seem to be in the same tune. There is among them a kind of solidarity to face unease –they gather to sing, dance or reflect on the future (or lack thereof) in the city that shelters them. In his fourth feature, Vadim Kostrov accompanies these melancholy characters over the course of one summer, with the aim of exploring their aspirations in a context that proves unfavorable to them. In each of the film’s scenes, all of them tainted with genuine warmth, the director confirms his remarkable capability to turn that feeling of emptiness into cinema. Orpheus is, ultimately, the final depiction of young people about to penetrate into the meandering path towards adulthood.",
