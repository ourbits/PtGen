    "introduction": "The main story of this film is enfolded between opening and closing sequences of a youthful Adam and Eve reliving their famous moment in the Garden of Eden. In the central episode, two young people in love are kept separate by their families. The boy has a monstrous father who lives in a castle and who may or may not actually be a vampire. The girl lives a reasonably prosperous middle-class existence. When the boy's parents die, it looks as though they might be able to get together, but only for a little while. This highly mannered and symbolic Mexican film was made by Rafael Corkidi, the cinematographer for the equally peculiar film, El Topo. - Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide",
