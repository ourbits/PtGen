    "introduction": "The sign “TITO” had dominated the slopes of Marjan Hill in Split for decades, when Josip Radanović and a couple of likeminded people tore it down in 1991. The huge metal four letter sign ended up in the ZOO on Marjan Hill, welded into the grate of an animal cage. Almost twenty years later, the filmmakers interview the main “culprit”, as well as many others who hold different and sometimes opposing views. They give us an insight into what it was to live in Ex-Yugoslavia under Tito, and clearly illustrate how a once popular adage still remains topical today: “And after Tito… it is Tito”.",
