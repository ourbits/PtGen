    "introduction": "The novella was originally published in 2003 as part of a collection of stories. It hinges upon tech that allows people to trade their bodies for younger, fitter, alternatives, although not always with the desired consequences. Synchronicity is pitching The Body as a returnable drama about what it means to be human.",
