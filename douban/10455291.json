Taha's wife was not happy with Izzah's presence and accused her of bring bad luck to the family. At the same time, Taha's debts were unmanageable and he decided to sell Izzah to a nightclub owner. At the nightclub, Izzah befriended a client named Hariz. Hariz bought Izzah from the nightclub owner with a high price to take her out of that hell hole. Upon Izzah's request, Hariz agreed to marry her, with the condition that everything must be kept secret.
