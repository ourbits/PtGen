    "introduction": "Fox has given a Season 3 pickup to Alert: Missing Persons Unit. The renewal of the procedural drama, starring Scott Caan and Dania Ramirez, has been expected.To make filming more cost-efficient for series producers Sony Pictures Television and Fox Entertainment, Alert will remain in continuous production, segueing from the abbreviated-by-the-strikes second season to Season 3, whose episode count is still TBD, I hear. There is an additional benefit to filming Seasons 2 and 3 back-to-back — Fox will have fresh episodes of the series in case production is disrupted by an IATSE strike this summer.",
