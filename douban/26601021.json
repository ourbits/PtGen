    "introduction": "A young single mom and her eccentric 10 year old son get thrown a little luck when they win a $7000 lottery. They believe their prayers have been answered but soon discover that the money may not be the answer to all of their problems. Lucky Story is a heart-felt adventure of a small family and their struggles and triumphs, both big and small. The story imaginatively and comically explores the relationship and unconditional love between Rose (Kristen Buckels), a young woman whose dreams took a sabbatical when she had a baby boy at sweet sixteen, and Benjy (Julian Shatkin) a 10 year old whose imagination and quirky personality leave him with a unique perspective of the world.",
