    "introduction": "Two brothers, skilled in the martial art of Taekwondo, have gone different paths. Younger brother Toshimichi longs to live up to his father's legacy and become a champion while elder brother Shinpei has become a low-level gangster despite having to be the heir apparent to the family's school. When Ishida, the brothers' friend and Toshimichi, along with two others head towards a camp for training, they end up in an accident that leaves them stranded in a forest where they must use their skills against a horde of various goons. Meanwhile, Shinpei begins to question himself and the use of his martial arts wondering if it is worth continuing life down a potentially dangerous path.",
