    "introduction": "Yuja Wang is known as much for her tiny, tight dresses and high, high heels as for her warm tone, energy and estimable technique. Her distinct playing style and sexy outfits, have made her the provocative enfant terrible of the classical music scene as this young pianist has set the classical world on fire. We follow Yuja as a public and private persona in her adopted hometown of New York City as she prepares for an exhilarating recital of works at New York City's famed Carnegie Hall. Yuja's program includes pieces from Prokofiev and Chopin and features Stravinsky's dazzling piano arrangement of three movements from \"Petrouchka.\" Her non-traditional style is sure to ruffle feathers but her extraordinary technique is guaranteed to open minds.—George Woolley",
