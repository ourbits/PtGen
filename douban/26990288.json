In this tiny house, four dancer nymphs are living besides Satoko(Singer), a human being. They are absorbed in Satoko’s music and having a comfortable life. But one day, dancer nymphs found by chance that another little girl was living in the house...“Hottamaru” is a coined word that is made of two Japanese words “Hotteoku”(leaving something as it is) and “Tamaru”(accumulating). It means things that accumulate if we leave something as it is. Fallen things from human body such as hair, nails, skins of the sole of their feet. Or various smells that accumulate in everyday life.",
