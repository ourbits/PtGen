A visually stunning cycle between reality and illusion, a carousel of emotions with thrilling twists. Eight people that cannot be more different meet in a BAR. For one night they escape their everyday life which is paralyzed of rituals and find themselves in a journey to their world of thoughts, their quintessential lust. Oppressed wishes, sexual fantasies and fears come to the surface and forgotten experiences are revealed. The evening takes its course.",
