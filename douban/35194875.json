The town has a strict segregation law where only certain individuals are permitted into public buildings depending on the set of eye balls. Timber sympathizes with the owls who feel miserable about the prejudice, that she decides to unify the community with the power of music. Her ambitions of equality wins the trust of each citizen even if it means stirring up trouble with the law enforcement.",
