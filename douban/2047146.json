    "introduction": "Whenever talk turns to the worst movie ever made, this is the one I always nominate. It is so bad, it's mesmerizing; you stick with it because you can't believe it could get any worse. It does. Dumb acting, dumber plot, dumbest dialogue I've ever heard. One actor who's the spitting image of a young Marlon Brando and who tries to imitate Brando's mannerisms. A leading lady whoproves her rep as an empty actress is fully deserved. When the lights came up after the movie was over, there was this look of stunned disbelief on the faces of as much of the audience I could see. Romain Gary was a good writer, perhaps even a great one; how he could do a thing like this is beyond me.",
