    "introduction": "Proka is different from others in his village. Working hard to overcome the drought he remain uninterested to the surrounding petty gossips. Being not like other villagers they see him as being against environment, the establishment and counter to their mentality. From here starts his existentialist affliction. Great picture with surprising authenticity.This is a drama about a village fool by the name of Proka who suffers considerable injustice and tragedy. When fellow villagers try to end a serious drought through spells and magic, they ask Proka to join them. Their motives are ambivalent because they only feel disdain for him. As a consequence, they set him up as a troublemaker, and a local policeman takes him away. Even though Proka gets out of jail, the policeman who put him there wants his property and the town's mayor would like to get Proka's widowed sister in his clutches. The covetousness of these two men is bad enough, but when Proka is arrested yet another time, he finds out that other people can be even worse.",
