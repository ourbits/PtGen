By their side lies a woman, very weak, but still alive. \"All that matters is past\" is the story of how Janne meets William after many years of separation. She leaves her family to live with him in a cabin by the river. They recreate the feeling of love and lust that they had as children, being sweethearts playing in the woods. But one day a Chinese baby girl is found floating down the river, and they realize that they are being haunted by William's brother. William and Janne runs further into the woods, trying to escape from their nemesis.",
