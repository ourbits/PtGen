    "introduction": "Popular YouTubers, filmmakers and collectors lift the curtain on their manic media collecting obsession that is not only a huge part of their lives, but the lifeblood of their existence. This new collector's documentary goes where no documentary has gone before as we enter a world of Horror hoarders, VHS hoarders, Vinyl addicts and Laserdisc obsessives. Enter the realm where DVDs and Blu-Rays are king and money is no object, when a new release hits it's a must buy. Physical Media truly lives on in this fascinating documentary from the creators of VHS Lives, VHS Nasty and Oh. the Horror. Brought to you by Tony Newton the creator and producer of VHS Lives and 60 Seconds to Die series.",
