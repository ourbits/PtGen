    "introduction": "Penned by Emanuela Canonico, Valerio D’Annunzio, Matteo Menduni and Giulio Fabroni, Nudes recounts the experiences of a group of teenagers who find themselves contending with the online posting of sexual images, and ventures into the insidious world of social media, utilising an intimate form of language and adopting the viewpoint of its young protagonists. The series tackles the phenomenon of revenge porn with a modern and realistic outlook on adolescents, but it also opens the eyes of adult audiences to the dangerous relationship between the internet and sexuality for the younger members of our societies.",
