    "introduction": "Tweenager Daniel has just lost his mother. His father is so distraught that he is throwing himself into his work, mostly. Worst of all, the family's Borzoi dog is so despondent for the lady of the house that he escapes to the cemetery and lays on her grave, time and again. Thinking it will be for the best, Daniel's father gives the dog to a trainer in order to find a suitable new home. Daniel begins to stir up trouble, too, at school and in the neighborhood, with the help of his two best friends. This disappoints his dad greatly. To help keep him focused, everyone agrees to let Daniel help out at the trainer's kennel. Once there, he helps dogs that are part of a circus-type dog show that circulates in the area. One dog, a temperamental Jack Russell Terrier named Gypsy, relates to Daniel very well. Can this dog help Daniel make it back to a normal kid's life?",
