Roy is dependent on Fayette for the basics in life, such as cooking and cleaning, yet he is always yelling at her that she can't even do these things right. To add what she considers a little sunshine in her life, Fayette buys a canary, which she initially hides from Roy. The yellow bird will eventually fundamentally change the nature of Fayette and Roy's relationship.@www.molikan.com",
