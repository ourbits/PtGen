    "introduction": "This all too brief 13 minutes of footage condenses all of the material involving Ford from two NBC TV shows: the first a grab from THis is your Life featuring Maureen O'Hara, and the remainder shows Food from a Wide Wide World episode in which he appears on location for a shoot - Rio Bravo no less- in which he's joined by Wayne, Ward Bond, and a superb wrangler who shows off what Ford calls \"hard\" and \"soft\" falls from the horse. This last is overseen by a gent from the Humane Association, and Ford is proudly able to say that he's never harmed a horse in his life. Wayne (or is it Bond) makes a quip about the damage he's done to actors over the years.Ford is in great form here. Again courtesy of the inestimable Tag.",
