Roel convinces him to buy the nightclub as partners, but team management refuses a generous contract prolongation, so Dennis threatens to leave abroad with his partner in crime. Alan is paroled after a year in prison, but most keep a shitty car wash job, lives with grandma with girl-friend Nina Beernaert to avoid bossy mother's meddling and is ruthlessly tracked by electronic ankle device; even punished for a minute a few yards enthusiastically welcoming the sports-car Dennis brought as spectacular birthday present",
