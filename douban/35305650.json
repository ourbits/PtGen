    "introduction": "Suzanne has had enough of her boyfriend Albert. The drama unfolds in fifteen tableaux, in which she goes over to Albert’s friend Emile. Still, these romantic worries go hand in hand with insatiable boredom. Through a delicate storyline and minimalist cinematic gestures, an ironic game of temporality is played. In this headstrong masterpiece, filmmaker Jean-Marie Buchet makes fun of cinematographic etiquette. La fugue de Suzanne is a rare gem in Belgian film history. Self-financed by the director, it creates an absurdistic reality with minimal cinematic gestures.",
