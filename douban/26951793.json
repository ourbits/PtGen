    "introduction": "In this experimental documentary, Paz Encina turns to a political era that indelibly marked Paraguayan history: the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner from 1954 to 1989. Through an exploration of the memories of the children of Agustín Goiburú—the most important political opponent to Stroessner’s regime, disappeared in 1979—the film interweaves the personal and the political. At the same time, it questions the efficacy of film’s potential to engage with questions of historical specificity and is itself an audiovisual archive that bears witness to the world.— Natalia Brizuela",
