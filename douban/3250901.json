    "introduction": "A segue between the Italian Gothic Horror and Giallo genres were the popular film versions of the Italian fumetti comic books. One of the first anti-hero's of this genre was Kriminal: A masked villain who dresses in a skeleton costume to accomplish his fiendish plans. Umberto Lenzi directed the first KRIMINAL film with Glenn Saxson starring as Kriminal. Kriminal is set to be hanged after he's accused of stealing the Crown Jewels.Right before the ultimate moment for Kriminal the rope breaks and he escapes! Soon Chief Inspector Milton of Scotland Yard receives a package containing the Crown Jewels and a nice little note from Kriminal attempting to clear his name of the wrong doing. Off Kriminal goes on another adventure that takes him around the world while being pursued by Inspector Milton always one step behind. Along the way he encounters dangerous situations and plenty of beautiful women. Directed with style by Umberto Lenzi KRIMINAL is a must for fans of Mario Bava's DANGER: DIABOLIK. Also stars Helga Line and Andrea Bosic. Followed by the sequel IL MARCHIO DI KRIMINAL.",
