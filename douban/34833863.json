    "introduction": "Catello is a “rag doll”, a small second-hand clothes retailer who dreams of becoming a costume designer. These “pieces” leave every day from his warehouse in Ercolano and arrive in the most prestigious tailors in the world to dress the best actors of Italian and international cinema. In these splendid ateliers, Piero Tosi, Gabriella Pescucci, Colleen Atwood and Claudia Cardinale will tell us about the beginnings of their careers and the films to which they are most attached. At the same time, following Catello’s actions, fears and desires, we will discover how much a “rag doll” and an Oscar winner for costume can share, if the same passion for the dress that has made Italian cinema unique and recognized all over the world unites them.",
