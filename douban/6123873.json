    "introduction": "Violeta (Alessandra Negrini) is a 40 year old attractive dentist. Her husband Djalma (Otto Jr.) has been giving thought to his life and marriage while going for a swim and has come to the conclusion that he's going to leave his wife, kids and the city. Violeta finds out about this in a phone message just hours after making love to him and heading out for her work day. She decides to drop everything and catch a plane to go in search of her wayward husband but finds that the last plane has left and she'll have to wait until morning for the next flight. After experiencing a series of clumsy injuries, checking into a hotel and having a night out in a club she runs into Bel (Gasi Pereira), a homeless little girl who likes to collect Bandaids and her single parent father Nassir (Thiago Martins). While wandering the Rio streets, beaches and airport she mulls over the thought of whether her husband is worth it or not.  (written by johno-21 on IMDB)",
