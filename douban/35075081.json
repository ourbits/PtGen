Titus Freeman enters this daunting world determined to work the legal system to side-step his sentence but instead discovers a new life beyond the grave that is eternal. Outside of this hopeless world is Titus' victim's wife Trisha who has vowed to work the legal system to carry-out his execution. Her new-found ambition covers a much darker secret that only her late husband Ivan knew about. It is not until this life-altering secret is exposed that Trisha can escape a prison of her own.",
