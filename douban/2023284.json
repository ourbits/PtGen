    "introduction": "In the city of Bronston, staying alive is a twenty four hour job... A wild bunch of hooligan kids who call themselves the Red Skulls have been the dominant street gang in the city for years. But everything changes one night when Uri, the leader of the Skulls, sees his best friend hacked to pieces by a rival group. Uri decides to get out of Bronston before he shares his friend's same fate. The only problem is the rest of the gang doesn't plan on letting him out so easy. The new self-appointed leader, Lester, has set a trap to lure Uri back, but without Uri in charge, all is not well within the gang's ranks. A traitorous member has set a trap of his own for Lester and the rest of the Red Skulls are about to become the victims. Now, Uri is about to find out the only thing more dangerous than a backstabbing street gang... is a mutated, cannibalistic street gang!",
