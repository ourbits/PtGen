    "introduction": "This film takes you on a journey of mystical revelations through magic mushrooms and meditations.In ‘Descending the Mountain’ psychiatrist Franz Vollenweider and Zen master Vanja Palmers create a ground-breaking scientific experiment located on the majestic Mount Rigi in Switzerland.The film shows if and how, when united, psilocybin and meditation might expand our understanding of the nature of consciousness.Leaving the iconic visuals of the 60’s behind, ‘Descending the Mountain’ uses animation, sound, and A.I. to create a new visual language for the transcendent experience of oneness with nature.",
