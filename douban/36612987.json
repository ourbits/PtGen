    "introduction": "塔林黑夜电影节影评人之选竞赛。“Nobody Leaves Alive” by André Ristum is shot in beautiful but also distancing black and white. Looking at the Venice line-up, this seems to be a trend this year among the maestros of cinema. The film is inspired by true events that took place in the last century in the “Colonia” hospital in Brazil. Whoever didn’t fit the standards of society, or their family’s perception of it, was locked away, tortured, and killed. There were altogether more than 60,000 victims. Hope dies last, and some of the inmates don’t give up the fight. We’re reminded of film classics such as “One Flew Over the Cookoo’s Nest” or “Alcatraz”.Decades later, the topic of this film hasn’t lost any of its relevance and is a must-see this year in Tallinn. Without spoiling the end, of course, someone must be left alive to tell her story and take revenge.",
