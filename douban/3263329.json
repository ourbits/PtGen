    "introduction": "讲述两个普通智利家庭的悲欢历史，从皮诺切特时代至今。2006年圣塞巴斯蒂安国际电影节TVE奖，2007年意大利特里斯蒂拉美电影节最佳导演奖。http://sydneylatinofilmfestival.org/cms/feature-films2008/69/As two families celebrate the engagement of their children, one of the lovers unearths a family secret. A dark secret is set to tear a family apart...Fiesta Patria is a metaphor for the social and moral state of Chile, and provides a provocative testimony of a period that ranges from the Pinochet dictatorship to the present day. The film makes use of a gallery of representative characters from Chilean society to tell the story of two families that get together in a country house to celebrate the National Holiday and the engagement of their children, Macarena and Alvaro. Just before the event comes to an eagerly-awaited happy end, young Macarena discovers the family's best kept secret.The ghosts of Chile's Pinochet-era history, in the guise of family secrets, come back to haunt two families. Bride-to-be Macarena learns some startling facts about her parents when her fiancé's uncle recognizes her mother as a fellow leftist from the early 1970s — bringing up uncomfortable questions about how her mother and her army officer father met during the 1973 coup. Official Selection, 2007 Tribeca Film Festival.",
