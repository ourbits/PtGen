The film featured the speech that deceased President Lech Kaczynski was going to give during an event in Katyn. Most of the film is occupied by the image of the president's wife, Maria Kaczynska. However, ordinary citizens saw a lot of negativity in this film. The film was released in 2010. The author of the film adaptation is Mikhail Elkin.",
