    "introduction": "For fans of Amer, here's the last and best of Cattet and Forzani's short films (the only one not included on the U.K. DVD for Amer).  Considerably more complex and refined than their previous shorts, this almost dialogue-free film takes us inside the minds of our two main protagonists via extreme close-ups and defocused abstraction.  Incredible Scope photography, sound design and editing combine with a captivating performance from Mick Gondouin (best known for being pummelled to death with a fire extinguisher in Noé's Irréversible >> indeed, it's Noé's work that comes to mind more than the Giallo films Cattet and Forzani cite as influences).  Gondouin's face is so unusual and expressive that his visage alone sustains interest for the duration of the short.Synopsis:Sultry courtship display between a waitress and customer in a café.At nine o'clock in the morning, the Santos Palace coffee bar opens its doors. The waitress pours her first cup of coffee for an unknown elderly man. They circle each other a little, in a kind of sultry courtship display. When the other, younger waitress arrives, jealousy ensues.",
