Now, three years later, Adam cannot attend a wedding without becoming ill, much to the dismay of his new girlfriend, Holly (Grace Phillips). Adam's job is on the line when he is unable to sell the comic strip, \"Kreature Korner,\" to a single newspaper. At a lunch meeting, however, an insecure editor (John Hines) agrees to buy the strip on the condition that Adam serve as best man at his upcoming wedding. Despite the fact that he and Jimmy are veritable strangers, and despite his aversion to weddings, Adam succumbs to the arrangement in order to save his job. When Adam and Holly arrive in the small farm town of Grass Creek, Indiana, they discover that Jimmy has told everyone that he and Adam were best friends and roommates in college. And not only is the wedding threatened by the bride's (Oksana Fedunyszyn) ex-boyfriend, Adam cannot escape the feeling that he is reliving his own nightmare. His wedding phobia begins to rub off on Jimmy, and soon, Adam finds himself responsible for frightening Jimmy away from the altar. Eventually, the events surrounding the wedding put Adam and Holly's relationship to the test.",
