In so doing, it helps the guys from the junior classes, and Gromov back on friendly terms with them as equals, helping them establish an uneasy relationship with their parents. All this leads to misunderstanding seniors, problems in school and, worst of all, the mother's disapproval of Mitya's classmate Nina, who because of illness is the second year. It would seem not to sit more than Romeo and Juliet at the same desk, but the thunder is not so easy surrender. He decides to do everything possible to also stay for a second year.",
