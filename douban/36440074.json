When Denni discovers that his father is beating his mother, he decides to hire the Secco (in his eyes a capable hitman). Set in a desolate winter Riviera, a fairy-tale place where anything seems possible and pain itself is possibility, Santoni’s directorial debut is a coming-of-age film that delicately recounts violence against women, knowing how to look at it across the board and through the eyes of those who, though powerless, decide to act.",
