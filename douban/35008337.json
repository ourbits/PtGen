    "introduction": "\"The Longest Night\" is the shocking true story of the 1980 terror attack on Kibbutz Misgav-Am in Northern Israel, in which a squad of five militants from the Iraqi-backed Arab Liberation Front, took over a children's dormitory, holding a group of toddlers and their caretaker as hostages. This riveting film follows the events inside the nursery, the tense negotiations, the parents' agonizing wait, and the rescue attempts by commando units, with a tragic loss of lives on both sides resulting in what has become known as Israel's \"longest night\".",
