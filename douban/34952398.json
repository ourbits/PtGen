    "introduction": "His new effort, penned by the helmer himself in co-operation with Bojan Vuletić and Nicolas Ducray, is a contemporary adaptation of the Serbian medieval epic poem Banovich Strahinya. It follows a man called Strahinya and his wife, Ababuo, both aged 28, who leave Ghana at the beginning of the migrant crisis. They manage to reach Germany but are finally deported back to Belgrade. Serbia may not be Germany, but Strahinya does his best to start a new life. He works hard to secure asylum, trying out as a football player for a local club and working as a volunteer for the Red Cross. However, the process is lengthy, and Ababuo, a passionate woman aspiring to become an actress in London, feels unfulfilled in her life. One night, a new group of Syrian refugees arrives, on their way to Western Europe. One of them is Ali, a charismatic left-wing activist. Ababuo initially mocks him, but the next day, she leaves Serbia with him, with no explanation. Thus, Strahinya sets off on the Balkan migrant route for completely different reasons to anyone else: for love.",
