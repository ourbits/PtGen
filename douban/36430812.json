    "introduction": "On May 14, 1948 in Tel Aviv, David Ben-Gurion proclaimed the creation of the State of Israel... A historic date for Jews around the world, after 2,000 years of exile and the suffering endured by the survivors of the concentration camps. the death. But for more than 700,000 Palestinians who would have to leave their own lands, it was the beginning of an injustice. Through the itinerary of several families, the two documentaries presented here trace the destiny of the Jewish and Palestinian peoples throughout the 20th century. Illustrated with numerous unpublished documents, in color or colorized, from amateur films, family archives or excerpts from private diaries, the films propose to discover how the persecutions suffered by the Jewish people nourished the hope embodied by the Zionist dream, and led to the creation of the State of Israel, thus precipitating the misfortune of the Palestinian people.—Point Culture",
