    "introduction": "人生就是一个茶几，上面摆满了各种杯具。Exactly. That is what the short film says. Life is a tragical cup that ends a different end. Just like the corto film LA TAZZA. YES, cup, beatuiful but tragic cups.Well, if each cup stands for a life, or a love, or a section crap of life, the end is there. When it is broken, you could throw it away; or you can buy another one to replace it; or you can repair it, which however is never the same as the orignal one because there is always a crack after repair. Or, you just make a new one by yourself, and make your name on it.But by the way,why should we track our life back the old pattern, only for the name on it ? I don't understand. If given a chance, I'd rather have that new red one. When the red one unfortunately was broken, ok, let's forget it.  A small on detail on the old yellow cup, there is moon and sun pattern, is it complex? A TRAGICAL CUP",
