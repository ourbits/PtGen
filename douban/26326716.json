    "introduction": "AGED is a 45 minute experimental documentary about the relationship between aging and corporeal perception. From 2005-2011, along with my sisters, I was a caregiver for my father, during his swift movement into old age. Over this period I maintained a practice of diaristic sketching using film, video and sound, and through this process I collected a significant archive of intimate moments, at the summer cottage, where my father chose to die. This raw material has been worked and reworked through various modes of digital and filmic manipulation. Ultimately `AGED' uncovers the common process of aging, the cinematic elements acting as a corollary for changes in human perception with a view to exceptional vision.",
