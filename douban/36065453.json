    "introduction": "British writer Devorah Baum has just published her first book – a guide to feelings like guilt, paranoia, envy and self-hatred.  She’s off to the US to promote the book via public conversations with intimidating academics and writers like Zadie Smith.  With two small kids in tow, she’s stressed out.  How can Josh, her husband, help?Probably not by making a film about the whole trip. Before long, the feelings laid bare in Devorah's book get played out between them, revealing how much remains stubbornly unreconstructed in our supposedly progressive couplings.",
