His niece, Countess Therese, is an ambulance driver with the French army, and one day she hears from her uncle, who requests that she meet him in a small town in Maine and bring the crown jewels with her. Unfortunately, a jewel thief finds out about the meeting and makes a deal with the Luranian pretender to the throne: he will steal the jewels and he can keep them if he kidnaps and turns over the Countess to the usurper.",
