Held together by the everyday lives of people moving about in the various regions of the city, this film conveys a metaphorical map of life.Starting out in the well-known Bab-El-Oued district in the west, the journey continues, via Baïnem to Aïn-Benian on the city’s periphery, revealing as it progresses the relationship between people and the places where they live.",
