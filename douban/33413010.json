But things take a turn when her college boyfriend, Kyle, suddenly reappears in her life. Kyle had proposed to Angela after graduation and she turned him down - she wasn't ready to commit to one person and wanted to focus on her career. Now Kyle is a famous photographer and is very wealthy. He hires Angela to manage his money, and what begins as a strict business relationship soon turns into a heated affair. But as Angela begins to spend more and more time with Kyle, she realizes that this trip down memory lane may be a disastrous mistake. When her life suddenly takes a downward spiral with her fiancé, friends and work, Angela is forced to confront the fact that Kyle may no longer be the sweet, gentleman of her past.
