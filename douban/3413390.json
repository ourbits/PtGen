    "introduction": "The immaculate beauty of the northern landscape. Life naturally and harmoniously passes by in a woodland preserve where Alexandra has long lived and worked, and it seems the opportune spot for starting up a relationship with a young ornithologist named Peeter. But a heated dispute between them creates near unappeasable resentment on both sides. Although they get over their feelings of hatred and even replace them with an unexpected rapprochement, the promising development of their relationship ends in tragedy.",
