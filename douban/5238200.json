    "introduction": "Strange as Angels tells the story of Marilyn Ross, a beautiful painter in Chicago who decides to leave her mundane life behind and search for inner happiness until she meets Rodney Porter, a recently divorced journalist and the two begin an intense romance. Marilyn's is a story about the complicated notion of female independence in a post-feminist era; she feels the pull of romance, sex and longing but fears that succumbing to her desire may wrench her individuality away. Marilyn's is a soul-searching journey that explores the question of whether it is better to seek happiness within oneself or rely on love for all of life's answers.",
