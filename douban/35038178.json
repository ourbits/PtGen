    "introduction": "\"RIDING FAITH\" is an uplifting and inspirational story about family, faith and never losing hope despite all odds. The story is set in small town America, and centers around GRACE and her majestic white horse named FAITH, who was given to her by her father, MIKE, just before he went off to war where he was killed in action. REBECCA, Grace's mother, is doing her best to help them both cope with the pain of losing a loved one. At the same time, she must find a way not to lose the family ranch which is on the verge of foreclosure. As they reach rock bottom, they become forced to sell off everything they have, including Grace's horse which she loves more than anything in the world.",
