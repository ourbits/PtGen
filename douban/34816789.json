    "introduction": "The film rescues from oblivion the tragic memory of Antonio María Valencia (1902 – 1952), pioneer of Cali’s musical and artistic culture. A moving and well documented portrait of the Colombian pianist and composer, who gave up his brilliant career in Paris in order to intervene in the cultural desert that was Cali, from the 1930s to the 1950s. He founded the Conservatory of Music of Cali and contributed to develop the Institute of Fine Arts.",
