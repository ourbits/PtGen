He even puts off being a parent, much to the displeasure of his wife, Suman, who he has been married to for over five years. His continued overtures to get other employees to invest backfires, and he not only gets alienated but also fired. His life will get even more complicated after Inspector Rana suspects him of stealing 10 Crore Rupees from IDL Bank of Commerce.",
