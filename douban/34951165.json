    "introduction": "The project, penned by the director himself and commissioned by NRK Super, is an adventure-driven love story set 120 years from now. It follows a 14-year-old boy called Anton, who lives in a dome, free from pollution and radiation, large enough to house an entire city. Life inside the dome is for the privileged, with life expectancy at 160, versus just 60 outside the protected zone. Anton, who is craving adventure, meets a girl his age, Emma, part of a large clan outside the dome, who occasionally enters the protected zone with her mum to do odd jobs. While anger and revolt rage outside the dome, the two embark on a relationship and will turn both of their worlds upside down just to be together.",
