Controversy has hounded him since he published his first article more than forty years ago, and he has remained in the eye of the hurricane ever since. Is he the last representative of a disappearing time? Has social media put an end to the traditional influence of the critics. Taking the background and personality of this very controversial figure as its basis, El crítico / The Critic will also endeavour to reflect on the enormous changes taking place in Spain in the field of film criticism.",
