Unexpectedly he finds himself on a curious place, a wonderful, ?softened? and fingent world (Ukraine), wich reacts more sensitevely on human thoughts and desires than the places he lived before. He arrives to a world, where the rules are not the same, and within certain frames the most absurd desires can come true. Mr. Ors Haros decides to find happyness, and not letting it go, at that time he does not think, he has to face the effect, wich is best described by filmmakers as the ?MOBIUS CUTING?. Or maybe noway.",
