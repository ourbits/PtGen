    "introduction": "For over four decades, Young-dong and Hyo-sook have run a rice cake shop in Oryu market in Guro. More than a decade ago, however, developers arrived on the scene, forcing many merchants out and leaving only a handful behind. Despite the merchants' collective desire to preserve the essence of traditional markets, the development process has been incremental. Frustrated, they finally take to the streets to voice their concerns aloud.",
