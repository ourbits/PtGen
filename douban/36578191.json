    "introduction": "Vidas Zenonas Antonovas has been recorded in the book of the most interesting criminals of Soviet Union. He stole around a million rubles from the state's institutions. Together with his accomplices, he hijacked a plane with passengers in order to split for Africa. He has been nicknamed \"The Father of Mafia\". 20 years of his time he did in 15 different prisons. Now he is 71 and has a big family - 10 children, 2 grandchildren and a newborn son. It is a documentary about the values of an ex-con, about a man challenging time and destiny, about the drives of an insatiable lust for life about. It is a love story of one family. There are neither romantic moments nor miraculous changes. But there is a strong potential to change our understanding about what happy and loving family is or could be.",
