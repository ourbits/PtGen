    "introduction": "The action takes place in three countries - Russia, America and Japan. Vladimir Ognev is the son of a family of emigrants from Russia. In the early 2000s, he lives and studies in the USA, where he meets Anna, his future wife. He has a brilliant scientific career and a happy personal life. Immediately after defending his dissertation, Vladimir receives an offer - he is invited to work in a closed international organization, a special department of the United Nations. Vladimir is offered to study a hypothetical scenario: how will human society react if it finds out that an alien civilization exists and has been in constant contact with us for many years? Over time, Vladimir realizes that this scenario is far from being as fantastic as it seems, and the significance of his research is by no means only scientific.",
