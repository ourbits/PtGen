There are no subs for me to be able to describe the plot but to be honest...even if there were I'm sure the film still wouldn't make sense!From what I could make out - a little boy (with some nice kung fu skills) spends his time flying around on a magic gourd battling one, two and three headed rubber dragons, bird men, an evil man with a plastic eye on his forehead and ape men who have the ability to fire laser beams from their eyes.",
