    "introduction": "Every year, thousands of people are killed by guns in America. Each shooting devastates and forever changes the victim's family and friends. Behind the Bullet explores a side of gun violence that's rarely talked about - the impact a shooting has on the shooter. Four individuals share how the pull of a trigger changed them emotionally, physically, psychologically, and spiritually. They describe the conflicting emotions and moral injury that comes after a self-defense, accidental, or unintentional shooting, offering a new and unbiased perspective on gun violence.",
