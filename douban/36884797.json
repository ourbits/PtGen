    "introduction": "Butterflies, totem poles and satellites. Incisive lines and slashes of colour. Images inspired by West Coast Aboriginal art, by nature and by personal experience. Welcome to the world of Canadian painter Jack Shadbolt, and to Transfigured/Transfiguré, Stephen Arthur’s brilliant animated homage to his work. Using computer technology, Transfigured/Transfiguré portrays Shadbolt’s shamanistic vision by animating a large number of his paintings into a seamless flow of interacting, transforming figures.",
