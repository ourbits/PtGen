    "introduction": "'The Secret Life of Death' reveals a sneak peek inside one of the oldest family run funeral homes in Australia - Walter Carter Funerals, which has been based in Bondi Junction since the 1880s. Told through the eyes of two of its youngest and most recent female recruits - Jasmine Cameron, a funeral director; and Amber Coote, the mortuary manager - this observational documentary lifts the lid on one of the last great taboos: death.",
