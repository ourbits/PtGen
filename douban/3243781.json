    "introduction": "本片是巴西著名实力派女演员Fernanda Montenegro（《中央车站》）的银幕处女作，讲述一个遭受生活打击的女人一心求死的痛苦经历，也是她至今表演最成功的作品之一，首次获得了巴西电影节最佳女主角奖而成名。本片改编自Nelson Rodrigues的戏剧，由新浪潮导演Leon Hirszman执导。Woman who is obsessed with death wants a first-class burial for herself, and even buys a luxury coffin beforehand.Zulmira (Fernanda Montenegro) is a woman who visits the doctor when she decides she is dying. The doctor pronounces that she is in good health, but Zulmira sets aside a sizeable sum of money for her elaborate funeral. She catches cold and asks her husband (Ivan Candido) on her deathbed to take the money for the services. The roguish husband passes himself off as a cousin and gives her the cheapest available funeral. He goes to a soccer game where he gambles away the rest of the money and falls apart emotionally in this grim and satirical comedy drama.Leon Hirszman's films pursue the subtle and the psychological searching for the contradictions of character. A FALECIDA (THE DECEASED WOMAN, 1965) wills her own death in anticipation of her opulent funeral. Her husband, following her instructions, discovers her rich and corrupt former lover and uncovers a passionate and abandoned side of the woman who, with him, had always been neurotic, repressed and obsessive.This film was based in a Nelson Rodrigues' story. It's about a married woman , who lives in a suburb in Rio de Janeiro . She's not happy and dreams of a sophisticated funeral for herself. Fernanda Montenegro is one of the best actresses of Brazil and Nelson Rodrigues one of the best dramatists. A great drama.",
