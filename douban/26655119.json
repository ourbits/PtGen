    "introduction": "The new and provocative film by Amy Hesketh, based in the story by Robert Louis Stevenson, tells the story of a gothic and decadent family of genetic vampires who need human blood to survive and prolong their lives, and where incest is the only way to maintain the family line. They don't mix with the outside world and when they do the consequences can be disastrous. The film centers in the avatars of Olalla, her daughters, Olalla and Ofelia and her brother Felipe. Both, Olalla the mother and Olalla the daughter, both interpreted by Amy Hesketh, are somewhat fractious, they can't control their impulses thus endangering the entire family. Hesketh starts her story where Stevenson's ends. A new guest arrives to the family's hacienda starting a struggle for the attentions of Olalla between the new comer and Felipe, the vampire's brother. Olalla sinks deeply in her madness and unable to control her tenebrous instincts, first attacks Roberto, the guest, and soon after the village's priest. ...",
