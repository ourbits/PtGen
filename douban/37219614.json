The movie will chronicle the landmark 1977 San Francisco sit-in, where over a hundred individuals with disabilities took over the federal building in protest. Their goal was to compel the government to enforce Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, a provision requiring accessibility in all federal spaces.",
