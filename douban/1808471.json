    "introduction": "Colt 38 special squad is a rare breed in the poliziotteschi genre. Excellent shot and filled with great casting, cinematographer/director Massimo Dallamano really comes trough on this one. Known for his outstanding camera precision on the Sergio Leone trilogy Colt 38 grapes you all the way. Of course there are a lot good examples for movies in those Italian cop/crime films.Like Milano Calibre 9 or The big racket. But Colt 38 special squad belongs among those films. Rather than just focusing on the usual violence this one delivers also a other angle, those of the mental-pain and struggle. Like a real pro Massimo let's you get involved in those characters and start to care form them. With all well paced storytelling we follow French crime lord Ivan Rassimov as the Dark angel in his mad rage against the city and his cops. Expeccialy against Marcel Bozzuffi as hard boiled Capitan Vanni. An old beef is going on between the two of them. Personal as can be, Vanni and his special crew of cops now not only arresting the locals bastards but are also mix up in the personal vendetta between Vanni and the crew of Dark Angel. The result is well packed storytelling with some brutal, but subtle action. Colt 38 is a well crafted movie with memorable scenes. Think in the line of city bombing and care chases. Rassimov is one's of the most cool killers. But really, Vanni is stealing the show in my opine that is. Of course also in real life those guys competing. Both are die hard actors. Dirty rotten by all those amazing scripts in there carrier. Kinda like De Niro and Pacino in Heat. Do not make the mistake of thinking less about this movie in budget ways. It's great cinema and a prime example of Polliziotesschi madness. Not to be missed",
