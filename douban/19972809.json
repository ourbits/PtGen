    "introduction": "On the bottom of a perfectly ordinary pond lies a secret world of frogs. There is only one flaw in the frogs' abundantly colourful lifestyle: their complete ignorance of the outside world. A brave little frog called Snooper decides to check out the surface. Once there, he runs into Eddie, a boy whose father is building a concrete suburb on top of the pond. Eddie and Snooper must save the pond while being chased by foreign agents who want to get hold of Snooper's amazing hi-tech gadget.摘自欧洲儿童电影协会(ECFA)网站：http://www.ecfaweb.org/network.htm",
