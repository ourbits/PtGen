    "introduction": "veryone who had any reaction to the incidents that took place Sept. 11, 2001 owes it to themselves to watch this film. It is a non biased reflection and presentation of newscasts, interviews, physical evidence or lack thereof that the American mass media didn't seem fit to force feed its viewers as was done with the images that were literally burned into the minds of horrified viewers. The material contained in this film is shocking, the fact that this information has not brought more media attention is just plain mind numbing.The events that took place are tragic enough as they were, that so very many questions have gone unanswered and blatantly ignored compounds the situation exponentially. See the movie, listen to the information and decide for yourself, then most importantly...SPREAD THE WORD.",
