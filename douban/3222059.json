    "introduction": "据称是南斯拉夫拍得最好的一部吸血鬼恐怖片。改编自果戈理1835年的短篇小说《VIY》。Sveto mesto (A Holy Place, 1990) is based on a literary classic, Nikolai Gogol's 1835 short story, 'Viy'. However, Kadijevic uses it only as a starting point for his own explorations into the dark side of eroticism. Gogol's story deals with Toma, a reluctant theology student who is forced to read the Psalms over an (un)dead girl for three nights in a row. All the while supernatural forces are trying to grab him from the Holy Circle drawn on the church floor. Kadijevic adapts and enriches 'Viy' by inventing a new backstory for the witch-girl and her father. The dead girl, Catherine (unwittingly killed in the prologue, while in the shape of a hag), is referred to as a 'saint' and her father is a harsh and unpleasant man. Kadijevic departs further from the original story, and introduces an excess of perversity and horror more reminiscent of the Anglo-American gothic than the milder Slavic attempts in a similar mode. Incest is the name of the game here.The story of strange love between a young theologian and a beautiful daughter of powerful land owner. After the girl's mysterious death, the theologian is invited to, according to her wish, say his prayers in village church by her catafalque for three nights. Terrifying stories about deceased one, about her sinful relationship with her father and orgies, can not extinguish love of the young theologian. Tortured with sinful relationship with her father, filled with hatred, she doesn't stop to revenge to mankind after her death. The innocent theologian in love will also become her victim.",
