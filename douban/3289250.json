    "introduction": "This one-off drama tells the true story of perhaps the most audacious crime in medieval history. Starring Kris Marshall, Geraldine James and Donald Sumpter.London, 1302. Luckless Dick Puddlecote is seeking revenge on the man who ripped off his business and had him thrown into prison. Unfortunately for Dick, that man is the King of England and, worse still, he's one of the most ruthless rulers that England has ever known.With the help of London's criminal underworld, some crooked monks and ladies of ill-repute, Dick plans to wreak revenge on King Edward I. He and his cohorts break into the crown vault, buried 16 feet below Westminster Abbey and empty it of the King's treasure.Against a backdrop of corrupt priests, conspicuous consumption, summary justice and the fear of eternal damnation, Dick takes on the might of Church and Crown, hoping to pull off the perfect crime.",
