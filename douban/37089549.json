Is it an accident or a cover-up for something darker?Documentary filmmaker Nerijus Milerius (“Exemplary Behaviour”) invited his former student Lina Lūžytė (“Together Forever”, “The Castle”) to direct this Lithuanian psychological thriller while investigating Japanese disappearances. Genius cinematographer Vytautas Katkus (worked on Locarno winner “Toxic”) captures the dark subject matter perfectly, jumping between moving cars and shooting in time-lapse.Actress Žygimantė Jakštaitė (“Runner”) plays Lina, a Vilnius morgue medic who becomes fascinated by the mysterious disappearance of a sailor named Vilkas (Wolf). Her obsession leads her to eerie places and disturbing encounters. The clock is ticking as Lina searches for the lost man.",
