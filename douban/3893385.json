    "introduction": "This movie is about Derick and Derwin - two boys who feel nothing but contempt for society. They separate themselves from others by wearing long black trenchcoats and listening to crappy industrial music. They also have nazi memorabilia and pipebombs lying around everywhere in their rooms. One day Derwin is ruthlessly beaten up by jocks. This event fuels the hatred Derwin and Derick had to a violent climax as the boys decide to take revenge by killing everyone in their high school and taking their own lives afterwards.This parody of the Columbine High School massacre may seem too low budget to watch at first but eventually the patient viewer is rewarded with gore, nudity and bad but funny jokes. The characters all portray the stereotypes that were involved in the real school shooting and the social satire this movie presents is often sharp and accurate. The viewers who are lucky enough to make it to the end of this very low budget movie will have an opportunity to compare its conclusion to the way school shootings are most often treated by society and the media.",
