    "introduction": "In 1849, Thomas Choi Yang-eob is ordered to gather historical information on the martyr, Catholic Father Kim Dae-gun, as well as to help Dae-gun's mother and sister. Yang-eob returns to Korea and remembers the past. At fifteen, Kim Dae-gun, Choi Yang-eob, and Choi Bang-jae were faced with all sorts of hardships but they still managed to study theology at Macao. The three return to Chosun. Unconcerned with the oppression and jealousy, they go to the people and throw themselves into preaching. Government officials capture Dae-gun as he is preaching and he dies at their hands. Father Choi discovers Dae-gun's sister as she is facing death but he has to leave the next day. At that time, Father Choi doesn't answer Pak Mal-goo's witty remarks. Instead, he collapses of typhoid fever and dies.",
