    "introduction": "The first scene sets the tone, a student just graduated in philophy,he's without job, has already refused some jobs it seems,because of idealism, despair, laziness or maybe real spiritual ambition?He often escapes in onirism or alcohol, which gives the occasionto see really inspired scenery and crossed by probably some recent ghosts of Serbia..The central character has a very pecular presence, between smile and tragic,his relation with another character called Angel can be interpreted in many waysand gives the story a good and often unexpected turn.Last but not least, when Milivoje Obradovic (I forgot the main character's name)in the second part accepts to work as a gravedigger, the film acquires a new and bigger dimension.Our hero begins to improvise funeral orations for the dead without family and it's not only all the traumasfor a nation or whoever needs it that can be dressed but also the very nature of art which is vibrating.Of course, not everything is perfect but the qualities I just talked about deserve to be highlightedand suit the principle of featured torrents, don't they?",
