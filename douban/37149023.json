    "introduction": "Meanwhile is a docu-poem in six verses about artists breathing through chaos. Through a dynamic collaborative process, the artists’ expressions are combined with historical and observational footage to unveil a rare cinematic meditation about identity, race, racism, and resistance as they shape our shared breath. Meanwhile is not just a film; it's a journey, a conversation, an experience not an education, reflecting the chaos of existence and the beauty found within it. Since its inception in 2020, this cinematic poem has been a communal effort to explore the complexities of truth and identity. Cinema—like identity—is entirely constructed, merely and astonishingly, a practice.",
