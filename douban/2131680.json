One phone call and his world crashes down around him. His only child, his daughter Sonia has been kidnapped. The Kidnapper, known as Kabir will only negotiate with Raina. What is his agenda?...

If Raina completes every task successfully his daughter lives, if he leaves even one task incomplete... And Kabir is watching his every move.... What will Raina do in the world where all his money and power mean nothing? And control has been snatched away from him. His daughter's life hangs in the balance...It is at this point when Kabir masterminds a series of events and circumstances that force Raina to commit crimes. And then asks Raina the same question.
