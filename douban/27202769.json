    "introduction": "The tradition of dragon boat racing began over 2,000 years ago on the rivers of China. Today, dragon boat festivals and races are celebrated around the world. Over fifty million people now race in national and international competitions including a growing number of cancer survivors.Awaken the Dragon Together is a mini documentary about Wellness Warriors, Massachusetts’ first dragon boat team for cancer survivors. It tells a story about a group of cancer survivor paddlers who have found an unconventional path to wellness through the ancient Chinese sport of dragon boating.For them, the spirit of dragon boating is essential - a group of people work towards the same goal and support each other as families during the most difficult time of their lives. It’s a story beyond survival, shows the power of individuals’ inner strength built up by a team.",
