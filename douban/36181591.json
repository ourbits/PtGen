    "introduction": "Tammy (Jane Levy) and husband David (Will Pullen) lead a quiet life in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, sharing a home with David’s parents, Bill (David Strathairn) and Venida (Celia Weston). David and Bill work together and have always been closely involved in each other’s lives. When Bill begins to suspect that David is straying in his marriage, he is drawn into a relationship minefield, caught between wanting to protect his amicable daughter-in-law and trying to understand his impulsive son. As Bill confronts the limits of patriarchal influence, he is also forced to reckon with disheartening behavioral patterns that may be transcending generations.Writer-director Angus MacLachlan returns to the Sundance Film Festival (writer, Junebug, 2005) with another deeply personal and humorous tale that beautifully reveals complex family dynamics and the inner workings of Southern towns. Placing a gentle lens on the extraordinary moments that lurk just beneath ordinary conversations, MacLachlan guides an ensemble cast to nuanced performances rooted in empathy. With realism, wit, and charm, A Little Prayer beckons us to embrace the unexpected ways we can connect with one another.源自：https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/638a1ac6d406b278caf2d67c",
