    "introduction": "The documentary is about sailing the arctic seas and how global warming is effecting natural living in the small communities as well as fauna life. The focus is primarily on three men who are friends that decide to leave their homes for the summer and take an adventure. There are some graphic scenes in the 4th episode that depict animals being killed for food, and whales being hunted and shot. The killing of the whale is not fast and may upset some viewers. The kill is to feed the family of local tribes people so it is not done out of cruelty",
