    "introduction": "Ross Kemp – actor, investigative journalist, novelist, Grant – is off to war again. He was once embedded in Afghanistan, for which he underwent military training (his only prior military training was acting in military training films). In Ross Kemp: The Fight Against Isis (Sky1), he travelled to parts of Iraq and Syria only recently taken back from Isis by Kurdish forces.Kemp’s occasional Partridgisms aside, this was actually a pretty solid documentary, blunt and informative, with impressive access to people and places. The crew were apparently the first westerners to cross the Euphrates into the newly secured Kurdish territory. If you’re tempted to ask: why send Ross Kemp to northern Syria instead of, say, Jamie Oliver? I’d have to say it’s because Kemp is not just willing to go someplace where he can crouch under flying bullets. He really, really wants to.",
