    "introduction": "Filmed on 5 continents and in 12 countries, 'Following The Ninth' is the story of four people whose lives have been transformed, repaired and healed by the 9th's message:' Alle Menschen werden Bruder (All People Are Connected).' At Tienanmen Square in 1989, students played the 9th over loudspeakers as the army came in to crush their protests for freedom. In Chile, women under the Pinochet dictatorship sang the 9th at torture prisons, and those inside took hope when they heard the music. In Japan each December, the 9th is performed hundreds of times, often with 10,000 people in the chorus. Part road trip, part adventure, Following The Ninth is a story about the power of music and human resilience in dark times.",
