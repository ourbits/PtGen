    "introduction": "[satyamev jayate」意为“真理战胜一切\"，这句话写在印度国徽上，是印度的座右铭。宝莱坞电影巨星阿米尔汗历时两年，打造出这一关注社会、贴近民众、深层次揭露社会问题的节目。他采访不同阶层印度人的真实故事,大胆曝光印度社会种种弊病,力图以残酷真相打动和唤醒大众,进 而努力改变现状、治愈丑陋伤疤。Episode 1: Fighting Rape 对抗强暴The first episode of Satyamev Jayate Season 2, telecast on March 2, 2014, dealt with the issue of rape and underlined several systemic factors that act as roadblocks on the path to justice for survivors.The Vote for Change campaign for this episode centred around three focal points:The setting up of One-Stop Crisis Centres in every district of India as per the guidelines recommended by the Justice Usha Mehra Commission.The creation of Vulnerable Witness Deposition Courtrooms across the country.A gender-sensitive, scientific and humane protocol for the medical examination of survivors of rape, to be uniformly implemented across the country.Episode 2: Police 警察On March 9, 2014, the second episode was telecast and it dealt with the need for reforms in the police. In 21st century India, the system of policing is still by and large within the framework of the 1861 Police Act introduced during the colonial British Raj. The police continues to be a ruler’s police rather than a people’s police.The Vote for Change campaign for this episode urged citizens to support the demand that the 2006 judgment of the Supreme Court in the case filed by former DGP, UP, Shri Prakash Singh be implemented and a people-friendly police force be created.Episode 3: Don’t Waste Your Garbage 不要看浪费你的垃圾The third episode of Satyamev Jayate, telecast on March 16, 2014, dealt with one of the most shameful problems persisting in our cities and towns, viz: garbage and the scandalous state of solid waste management.The Vote for Change campaign for this episode called upon people to support the demand that incinerator technology for burning waste be opposed and that state governments and union territories work towards implementing the Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000.Episode 4: Kings Every Day 我自君王，每日Telecast on March 23, 2014, the fourth episode dealt with the need for strengthening grassroots democracy and in particular, highlighted important measures to help fight corruption and increase public participation in governance.The Vote for Change campaign for this episode urged citizens to lend their support to the demand for social audits of the government’s expenditure on social welfare, and the passing of the Public Services Grievances Bill which will help ensure that essential services are delivered in a time-bound manner to citizens.Episode 5: Criminalization of Politics 政策犯罪Satyamev Jayate’s fifth episode, telecast on March 30 2014, dealt with the rampant criminalization of politics in our country.The Vote for Change campaign for this episode called upon people to support the demand that the proposal of the Election Commission to debar candidates with serious criminal charges (with appropriate safeguards) is brought into effect and such candidates are not allowed to contest elections.Just came out of my meeting with Honorable Prime Minister of India Shree Narendra Modiji. Was very kind of him to spare his valuable time.— Aamir Khan (@aamir_khan) June 23, 2014Shared with him the overwhelming support that we got from people across the country through Vote for Change Campaign...— Aamir Khan (@aamir_khan) June 23, 2014..on SMJ on the various issues that we tackled in our show.
