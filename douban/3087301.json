    "introduction": "Beautiful and imaginative view of Don Juan confronting his limits.Beautiful, imaginative, poetic and almost surrealistic approach to Don Juan in his late years. Rich in powerful images, like a giant shell being carried on wheels across the fields or in front of ancient buildings. The man who has found it in the sea is accompanied by his living shadow impersonated by a masked person who makes the same movements.Herald of sensual and intellectual freedom in a decadent empire tormented by religious fears and the concept of sin, Don Juan seeks reconciliation with his legitimate wife and his father, as he seems to prepare for a change in his way of living, or perhaps even his death. He is accompanied by his loyal servant Esganarel, that suffers much of his master's leg work (and other unpleasant situations) but at least is treated like a human being, almost a friend, by a Don Juan that foreshadows modern thinking.Witty dialog and elegant rhetoric merge effortlessly in the tradition of Moliere and of the classical Spanish writers. A pair of elegant touches of eroticism (one of them reminiscent of Velazquez paintings) and veteran Spanish actors like Fernando Guillén (fitting very well in his character) or perpetually beautiful Charo López contribute to this unpretentious and overlooked masterpiece by excellent director Gonzalo Suárez.",
