    "introduction": "Sierra Maestra, Cuba, 850 km east of Havana. The day before the celebration of the 52nd anniversary of the Revolution. An old man is repairing a few decades old motorcycle. A young dentist is trying to find some transport to a clinic in remote mountains. A middle-aged married couple run a public telephone booth in their modest house for villagers who have no phone. Fates of these people and many other inhabitants of Sierra Maestra are depicted on a day of ideological ecstasy, the day of the celebration of the 52nd anniversary of the Revolution. And the following day? The next day, driven by inertia, they all return to the rhythm of everyday life which is the same and is not very promising. But the revolution continues... For how long?",
