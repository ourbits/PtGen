    "introduction": "Last Man mounts worldwide live webcam images of eerily deserted squares and streets from the Internet from the time of the first COVID-19 lockdown in the spring of 2020 with scenes and sound excerpts from two post-apocalyptic horror films of the 1960s in such a way that factual and fictional elements merge almost seamlessly. The film thus shows us the frightening proximity of our current situation to previously only fictional narratives of such post-catastrophic scenarios.",
