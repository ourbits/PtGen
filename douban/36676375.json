    "introduction": "Ivan Titov is the best operative in the city. He has always worked without partners, but at one point two are imposed on him at once - the general's son Vlad and a recent university graduate, \"eternal excellent student\" Lera. Vlad, who received a law degree for show, dreams of leaving for London, but is forced to fulfill the will of his father-general - to work for a year in the operations department. Lera wants to prove that she really is called to be a police officer and that she studied with honors for a reason. Titov is annoyed - he has to tinker with this couple, be responsible for them, and even get them out of the stories in which they constantly get stuck. How does he know that these young guys will teach him to look at life differently and he will finally decide to make important changes.",
