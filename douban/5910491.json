Barnaby and Jones must uncover the secrets each suspect has been hoping to keep hidden, and their investigation includes a respected man who once ran a school for wayward girls, a pub owner who may have shorted the tax man on inheritance taxes, and a couple whose weekend trips to the seashore might be more than for a relaxing whiff of sea air.",
