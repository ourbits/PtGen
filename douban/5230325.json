    "introduction": "\"We began filming political life in Marseilles in 1989. A municipal election. The one that was to decide who would take over after Gaston Defferre. That was Marseille de père en fils.Ten years later, the emergence of political actors who are children of immigration became visible. We have chosen to show it thanks to two women, two Marseillaises, both of whom are not only militant Socialists but local political leaders, both of them daughters of North African immigrants, born in the districts in the north of Marseilles and therefore part of the third or fourth generation (after, you don’t count any more).Both of them are barely over thirty years old and both took part in the political battles of 2001, Nadia Brya in the cantonal elections, and Samia Ghali in the municipal ones.\"(Jean-Louis Comolli)",
