His songs have been covered by major artists, including Eric Clapton, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Fleetwood Mac, The White Stripes and many others. •For decades little was known about bluesman Robert Johnson. Legend was rife with supernatural accounts of his life and his pact with the devil, and conflicting versions of his death.
