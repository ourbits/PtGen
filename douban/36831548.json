    "introduction": "Cellist Eduard returns to the stage after a three-year pause-a crisis and unwillingness to perform, provoked by an emotional breakdown and subsequent mental disorder. This landmark appearance to the audience and critics is a great test for him. Svetlana's presence in the concert hall does not allow him to escape from the stage. During the performance, Edward is immersed in memories. The music is filled with moments of deepest love and disappointment... Eduard finds himself in the darkest depths of his mind, where he was afraid to look for a very long time, and finally understands the true reason for his departure from the stage.",
