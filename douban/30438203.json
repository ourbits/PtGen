    "introduction": "Hans calls his girlfriend Heinz, which tells you everything you need to know about their relationship. They're a typical couple who're stuck in a rut after eight years. Hans works at a copy shop and Heinz is an actress relegated to voicing a cartoon stoplight. On their anniversary, they go to the movies. It's a romance. But the spark on screen just doesn't strike them. When Hans gives Heinz's ex her phone number instead of putting up a fight over her, Heinz' alarm bells go off: How can this be love? They decide to make a list of everything that makes up a real love: Romance, desire, passion, jealousy, drama - deep feelings, in other words. Hans and Heinz methodically start checking off their list and realize: Real life is nothing like the movies.",
