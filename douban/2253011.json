    "introduction": "A documentary of the life of artist Al Hirschfeld. While there might still be debate as to whether caricatures are art, anyone who has seen Hirschfeld's elegant depictions of stage personalities over the years would unequivocably classify them as such. This movie, which took nearly ten years to make, follows the chronology of Hirschfeld's life closely. It includes many interviews with Hirschfeld himself, his second wife and his beloved daughter Nina. His drawings had appeared in The New York Times since the 1920s, and they covered the entire modern history of theater in New York City, a fact underscored in this documentary. American actors have long known that one sign of their having \"made it\" as stage actors, was a published caricature by this charming man.",
