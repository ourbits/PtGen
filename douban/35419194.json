    "introduction": "\"Top Chef\" is back with 15 of the country's best chefs ready to compete in Portland, Oregon. For their first Quickfire Challenge, the cheftestants are immediately thrown into teams and tasked with combining their favorite ingredients together in one cohesive dish for Padma and Portland local Gregory Gourdet. For their Elimination Challenge, the chefs will try not to \"quack\" under pressure as they're asked to create a dish featuring one of Portland's iconic local birds. Their dishes will be served in a blind tasting for the judges and the new dining panel of \"Top Chef\" all-star winners, finalists and favorites. Season 17 winner Melissa King joins Padma, Tom and Gail at the judges' table to help decide who will be the first chef to pack their knives and go.",
