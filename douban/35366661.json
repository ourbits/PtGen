The landlord tries to evict them. With that said, the landlord also owns an apartment that is unfortunately haunted and asks the girls to solve this problem in lieu of rent payment. In another episode they act as bodyguards for a famed lyricist. The girls are picky about their clients and yearn for that special case.",
