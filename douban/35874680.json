    "introduction": "Framed as a Batman episode, new archival footage details Eartha Kitt's run-in with Lady Bird Johnson and the president at a 1968 luncheon. Mixing TV clips of Kitt in character as Catwoman and as herself among Washington's wives, she summons her superpowers to sound off about the Vietnam War. A necessary reminder of how society treats Black women who speak up and how history regards heroines.",
