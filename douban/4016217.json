    "introduction": "This exhilarating animation by Norman McLaren will leave you breathless, as a simple image of a stick figure posting a letter becomes a frenzy of split second images, as the characters morph from man to woman to apple to mouth to bee to butterfly to candle to... well, you'll lose count quickly enough.This animated advertisement for the GPO rewards - and necessitates - repeated viewings, and some of the imagery proved too Freudian for the Post Office, who banned the film. This short film follows McLaren's ethos that animation was not the art of drawings which move, but of movements which are drawn. The wonderful score by Jacques Ibert adds to the ecstatic effect.
