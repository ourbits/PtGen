Located in the north of the island of Sumatra, Aceh, has been a locus of resistance since the time of Dutch colonization, and endured many bloody massacres : in 1965, seven generals were killed ; without any evidence, the communists were accused and an indiscriminate repression visited upon the rebels. Ibrahim Khadir, was imprisoned by mistake, with no trial whatsoever. In prison, he witnessed brutal murders and lived in daily fear of his life until his release.",
