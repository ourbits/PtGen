The band of three becomes a band of two, and Alex and Trent don't like it. However, when they discover that Leah isn't who she appears to be, separating Marc and Lea becomes priority number one. With the help of their perma-baked drug dealer friend, Max, Alex and Trent are about to go on an adventure of a lifetime, filled with violently angry nerds, ninjas, werewolves, and the occasional emotionally disturbed woman or two.",
