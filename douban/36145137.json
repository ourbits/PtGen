    "introduction": "An abstract eco horror short that invites the viewer to step into a territory where human and nature as separate categories do not exist. However, everything comes with a price. Through the fragmented inner monologues of Dr. Moreau, this film aims to map the psyche of western men and their (our) violent attempts to be the rulers of nature. The film was made by a hybrid technique, using original 8mm and 35mm shots by an up-and-coming cinematographer, Alina Vincze and by transforming found footage materials, mainly Soviet expired educational and science films by hand-painting and damaging the material. Márió Nemes Z. acclaimed writer and poet paraphrased H. G. Wells' story in his script evoking current ecological and philosophical issues.",
