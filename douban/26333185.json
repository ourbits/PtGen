Each one feels an immediate attachment to the place, and each one appeals to the concierge. But he is powerless to decide on anyone, including his own daughter. He humbly sends off each visitor's information to the owner, then waits. After many visits and still no decision, the concierge grows troubled. He goes to the owner, searching for an answer.",
