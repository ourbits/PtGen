On the way with the metallic-blue urn and shadowed by a nun, he circles the epicenter of the city, which is characterized by tourism, consumption, and lifestyle. His mission leads him to unusual encounters with construction workers, pedestrians, and the law. Death becomes an instrument to look behind the vulnerable façade of man and architecture.",
