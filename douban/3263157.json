    "introduction": "Cemetery memory is a short documentary on the history of the twentieth century. A record on the daily life of common people, not anonymous which lent their names to streets, squares or viaducts. Men and women who are not trampled on the moon, did not start wars, were not stars of cinema or TV, were not in newspaper headlines, do not discovered cure for any disease. People from simple life, with no glamor, but not really are devoid of beauty. Audible and visual fragments that were part of life for everyone, but that often went unnoticed.",
