    "introduction": "Clarkson is on a mission to find his favourite car of the year, and among the contenders at the Circuit Paul Ricard in France, are a pair of Ferraris - the V12, 6.3 litre FF and the 458 - McLaren’s MP4-12C, the latest Nissan GTR, Porsche's GT2 RS, the 570-horsepower Lamborghini Performante and the built-for-fun BMW 1M. The Stig is on hand along with Formula One star Karun Chandhok to help. Clarkson also tries the hybrid-engined Mugen Honda CR-Z, the Eagle Speedster, the all-new Jensen Interceptor R and the mighty Brutus...a vintage car fitted with a flame-spitting BMW airplane engine. It’s not all about track performance as Clarkson takes to the road in the Citroen DS3 Racing, the pocket rocket Abarth 500C and the dinky Renault Clio Cup.",
