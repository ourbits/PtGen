    "introduction": "Abstract architect and artist, Richard Meier, guides us on a detailed retrospective of his famed white buildings. Throughout his career, during which he designed a number of private homes and public establishments, Meier cites names such as Corbusier, Wright and Mies as his heaviest influences. Sharing in their artistic philosophy and theory, Meier has developed his own unique approach to design and construction. Following in the footsteps of his predecessors, Meier’s boldly recognizable stark white structures have solidified him as a staple of modern architecture. The film ends with Meier in Brentwood, deeply contemplating his approach to his latest project: the Getty Center.",
