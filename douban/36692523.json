    "introduction": "Daughters of the Cult, which launches on January 4, is a five-episode deep-dive into the history of a splinter group of Mormon fundamentalist cult members who perpetrated a deadly wave of violence and abuse for decades in the name of their fanatical prophet, Ervil LeBaron. Dubbed the “Mormon Manson,” LeBaron and his followers were hidden in plain sight throughout the Southwest and Mexico. Now, past members of the infamous cult tell the true story behind the string of murderous crimes.It features interviews with surviving ex-members, including multiple children of LeBaron, who speak about their experience being raised under their father’s rule. Fresh insight comes from relatives and law enforcement who worked on the murder cases, painting an emotional and grisly picture of a brutal madman ordering cold-blooded executions.",
