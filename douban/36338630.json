    "introduction": "Otto spends night and day blurring faces on Google Street View for a cent each. It’s the kind of work he and his friends around the world can find on Amazon Mechanical Turk, the crowdwork platform. Alongside his turker friends, Otto sinks into a robotic world that raises the question of humanity. A film aware of the redefinition of the notion of work, given the growing robotization of the world, and the replacement of the workforce by technology. The algorithm as a surveillance system of our movements and wishes. A humorous tease concerning the new (co)existence paradigms.源自：https://doclisboa.org/2023/en/filmes/human-not-human/",
