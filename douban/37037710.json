    "introduction": "»Let me know if you love me«: Charly Hübner looks at the past and present of the band Element of Crime. Since their formation in 1985, Element of Crime have been a constant in the German musical firmament. They’re seen as the best-known unknown or the least-known well-known band in the German-speaking world. What sort of people are they? How did they become what they are? Director Charly Hübner follows the four musicians on a tour of Berlin, specially put together for the film – to places that represent particular waystations in the band’s development. Never nostalgic, never »the good old days«. Element of Crime are far too alive for that.",
