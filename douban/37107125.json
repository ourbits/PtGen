Mark's outlook on dancing changes when one day his classmates make fun of him for engaging in what is considered to be a \"feminine\" activity. Embarrassed and humiliated, Mark decides to once and for all distance himself from ballroom dancing, even if it costs the relationship with his grandma. Only years later Mark realizes how negatively did this choice affect his identity and perception of himself.",
