    "introduction": "Based on a true story. Arigo, an uneducated man, happily married, father of six, is chosen by a mysterious force to rise up as a spiritually and supernaturally gifted surgeon. Miraculously healing thousands of desperate people, he now faces the scorn of the medical profession and his beloved Catholic church. Charged with crimes against the people his future is uncertain. Arigo, a simple, caring and deeply loving man who never sought fame or fortune, and whose encounters with multitudes of people, rich and poor, resulted in extraordinary healings beyond the explanation of medical science. The contrasting worlds of small town life in Brazil, politics, the Church and a penetrating voyage into the unknown, are played against a story line exposing the vulnerability of the human condition in all its characteristics and an eventual triumph against accepted beliefs.",
