    "introduction": "Berlin International Film FestivalYear\tResult\tAward\tCategory/Recipient(s)1960 \tNominated \tGolden Berlin BearLeopoldo Torre NilssonThis routine drama set in Argentina during the 1930s draws parallels between a family patriarch and a political despot who stoops to any corrupt means to increase his power and wealth. The parallels are easy to make because the man is the same in both cases. The grandfather in the family has a rigid, tight-fisted control over his grandchildren, who eventually begin to rebel against his authoritarian and ironically puritanical behavior. At first, there is no real awareness of his opposite, criminal behavior outside the home. But as one of the grandsons begins to mature in his political savvy, the grandfather comes under well-deserved fire at last.Based on actual events, FIN DE FIESTA tells the story of Mariano, a veteran political boss, who climbed from the gaucho class to a position of wealth and power maintained by terror and tightly controlled elections. We witness his decline through the eyes of his grandson, Adolfo. Keeping company with Gustavino, Mariano's henchman, the young man sees for himself the violence his grandfather imposes on his empire, and grows to hate the old man, delighting in his inevitable bad fortune.",
