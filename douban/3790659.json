    "introduction": "源自William Blake的诗The Tyger，是一部很前卫的实验动画。片中融合各种元素，木偶，板画效果和现代的数字技术。影片在制作过程中最大的挑战来自于图象，如何使最后的图象中各种元素看起来一致。少有的视觉效果，值得欣赏。As the lights of a carnival midway dim, a huge tiger emerges from the dark. As it walks through the city, illuminated plants flourish in its path. It approaches a large apartment building: a napping man's TV goes off, he wakes and walks to the window, sees the tiger and is transformed into a monkey. Similar transformations occur as the tiger walks through the city: cars become snails, football fans become insects, hipsters outside a club become toucans. The tiger reaches a hilltop outside the city. Behind him in the city, plants glow and the air is full of flying creatures.",
