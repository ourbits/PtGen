In a morgue, the corpse of a young man that suddenly died on the streets probably due to a heart attack will be examined by the coroner Elizabeth (Letícia Spiller). She questions with her colleague the death of a person so young and handsome, but the brain of the dead man somehow is working and he falls in love for her. Meanwhile, a deranged man invades the morgue and threatens Elizabeth with a gun, with the witness of the dead man, who is immobilized (since he is dead) and unable to help her.\"The Pulse\" is a bizarre and surrealistic love story, indeed very weird and intriguing, but with a great camera work. In the end, there is a message that people must love while alive, since after death there is nothing but loneliness and darkness.",
