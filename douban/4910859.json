    "introduction": "In 1986, the Chernobyl nuclear power lost control of one of its four reactors resulting chain reaction that created a series of explosions. 'Chernobyl: Life in the Dead Zone' explores how nature and animals would react and survive if the world was suddenly without humans. This fascinating programme takes place at the site of the world's worst nuclear accident - hastily abandoned by panic-stricken humans. In houses where people once lived and laughed, wildlife is making itself at home. Watch as the wild animals face challenges in an environment totally outside their comfort zone, while once-domestic species must rediscover their wild natures within.",
