    "introduction": "At some point in Keren Cytter's latest film we are told that 'all films have already been made.' Cytter, who in her recent video works has approached performative variations on melodramatic TV films and soap operas, is now turning the camera the other way: towards herself, her friends and her family. But even if the motifs in 'Des trous' indicate a shift in a more personal direction, Cytter's idiosyncratic signature is the same. It ends with the ultimate happy ending: a wedding, but starts off with a melancholy tone enhanced by the sentimental 80s pop and the slowly rolling credits, which place her family members and friends in the lead roles of their own lives. For if the personal narrative is the epitome of emotional authenticity, the simultaneously ironic and affirmative use of all the instruments of melodrama becomes all the more relevant. A ploy that is articulated in its own distinct way by the film's French voice-over.",
