She is a simple young woman who takes life as it comes, even if sometimes life puts obstacles in her way. She works at the cinema Le Club. She was not supposed to, but tonight she has to welcome a young depressive director Gaspard Kermarec. He happens to come from the same town as her, and his film happens to be as depressing as himself.",
