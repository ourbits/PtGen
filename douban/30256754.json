    "introduction": "Directed by Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Sam Green, THE UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE traces the history of Esperanto, an artificial language that was created in the late 1800s by a Polish eye doctor who believed that if everyone in the world spoke a common tongue, humanity could overcome racism and war. Today, a vibrant Esperanto movement still exists. In this first-ever documentary about the language, Green creates a portrait of Esperanto and those who speak it today that is at once humorous, poignant, stirring and ultimately hopeful.",
