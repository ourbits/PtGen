    "introduction": "《中国第一线》是一部采用第一人称叙事的散文风格纪录片，全长45分钟。这部影片以长春市双阳水泥厂为线索，在当时号称“中国第一线”，是一家有着辉煌历史的国营企业。作为水泥厂配套规划的家属区里长大的孩子，导演张瀚文的童年回忆和家族故事与这里紧密相连。如今，他故地重游，重温儿时记忆中的故园风雨，探访尘封于老照片中的陈年往事，再现集体生活的今日面貌。The First Line of China is a 45-min essayistic documentary in first-person narrative, which presents and examines the current status of an isolated industrial town in Northeast China, as well as the director's relationship with it since it’s his birthplace. The town was constructed simultaneously with a local state-owned cement factory to feed and host the workers who migrated here. The director considers this factory-town model as a combining result of the urban planning scheme and the radical industrialization of China in the 1980s, while the communal living experience serves as a bearer of both collective memory and individual sentiments.",
