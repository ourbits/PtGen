Set all around Buenos Aires during one momentous week in the lives of Mariela, an Argentinean illustrator, and Oliver, an American dog food executive working abroad, the film takes a look at conflicting cultural disagreements about intimacy and the way the once-simple idea of a marriage proposal has taken on an increasingly public, and sometimes ridiculous, weight in this golden age of YouTube.",
