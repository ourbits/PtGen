    "introduction": "Donald Trump dominated the 2016 Presidential with a master plan of political incorrectness, using The Art of the Insult to brand political opponents and bash the media all the way to the White House. In this film, Trump emerges as a marketing genius and performance artist who, despite being a Manhattan billionaire, captured the hearts of middle America. Critics are calling The Art of the Insult \"the most entertaining political documentary ever!\"",
