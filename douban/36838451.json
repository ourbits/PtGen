    "introduction": "The Harlem Hellfighters documents the hard fighting regiment of Black soldiers, who battled shocking racism at home and abroad while fighting the Germans in World War I. The Hellfighters, who saw more time on the frontlines than any other American regiment, were initially heralded upon their return only to quickly be discarded by the Army and country they served so valiantly. This one-hour documentary tells the important story of this courageous group, who included bandleader James Reese Europe and Purple Heart winner Henry Johnson. Their extreme bravery earned them the French regimental Croix de Guerre a century before the U.S. finally recognized their contributions to the war effort with a Congressional Gold Medal. © HISTORY®Executive Producer & Narrator: Robin RobertsProduction companies: History Channel, RadicalMedia, Rock'n Robin Productions",
