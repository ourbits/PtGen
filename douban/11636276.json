    "introduction": "Invited by the Viennale, the legendary 90-year-old French film essayist Chris Marker has recently created a one-minute festival trailer, following in the footsteps of directors such as Agnès Varda, Stan Brakhage, Jean-Luc Godard and David Lynch, who have done so in the past. The Viennale has chosen Marker’s work as its “anniversary trailer” because in it, Marker – like no other director before him – deals with the history of cinema in a playful and surprising manner. More precisely, he deals with the question of “the perfect viewer” that cinema has been looking for since the father of film, D. W. Griffith. Chris Marker ultimately finds this ideal viewer at the end of his small essay in an unexpected figure. See for yourself.",
