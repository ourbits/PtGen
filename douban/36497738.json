    "introduction": "Riki is not too sympathetic towards his sister’s boyfriend Ado. Nevertheless, Riki puts up with Ado as they are soon to be brothers-in-law. They also work together in a declining catering company. After their boss sets up a meeting about the reorganisation of the company, all the employees feel there will be layoffs as a “reorganisation“ is just another word for job cuts. Ado blames Melisa for the bad state of the company, his ex-colleague and boss’s ex-girlfriend. The demise of their business started at the same moment she split up with her boss, both personally and professionally. Ado comes up with a plan to save the company: they’ll beat up Melisa and force her to make up with their boss and to return to work with them. All the employees, including Riki, dismiss the plan as totally stupid and senseless. But, even though he has no logical rationale for his business-saving theory, Ado is adamant about seeing his plan through, counting on the passivity of his colleagues. Little by little, Riki is left standing alone against Ado’s plan, torn between a sense of justice and family.",
