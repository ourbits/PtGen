    "introduction": "Riki is a young waiter in a catering company that is doing badly. His best friend and colleague, Ado, is working on a pointless, violent plan to improve business. All employees of the company are against that plan. But Ado is persistent. What would you do if your best friend had an unacceptable plan he wanted to implement on your behalf? Is a sense of justice more important than friendship? Is it right to aggressively defend ideas that are noble and positive? Will an aggressive minority impose its will on the majority?",
