    "introduction": "\"Cops\" was among the earliest reality-based law enforcement shows, and remains one of the most popular of the genre. Each week, a camera crew followed the activities and daily beats of the officers of a different city's police department. Incidents ranged from routine traffic stops that evolve into charging the subjects with drug-related offenses; domestic violence; high-speed chases; and stakeouts and raids. The success of \"Cops\" led to other similar programs, with varying degrees of success. Written by Brian Rathjen {briguy_52732@yahoo.com}",
