Holmes is attempting to solve the disappearance of Neville St. Clair. Several days before, Mrs. St, Clair had been walking in a rundown section of London when she looked up to find her husband looking down at her from a window. A search of the rooms reveals her husband's clothing but he is nowhere to be found. They do find a crippled beggar with a horribly twisted lip and he is soon charged him with St. Clair's murder. Holmes has the solution to the mystery however. Written by garykmcd",
