    "introduction": "You hear three blows given by a wooden rod on the stage floor, then the red curtain before you opens. In front of you is a box full of cards, but you barely have time to play around before a rabbit bursts into the room. LATE. You’re late to your own crowning, Alice. As you go further into your dream, you meet the most peculiar creatures, and you are constantly put to the test. Will you catch your crown before the clock strikes?Alice is a complete VR experience which immerses the audience into a virtual scenery and allows them to interact physically in real time with characters and objects. Alongside the main narrative, the audience understands progressively that they are Alice, and that they must, just like Lewis Caroll’s heroine, engage with the characters they meet.",
