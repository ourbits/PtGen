    "introduction": "A classic love triangle of two sisters, a story of siblingrivalry and the man that comes between them…Gillian cycles away from her ol d life, changes her name and gets a job picking fruit. Gorgeous bad boy Kev pops a strawberry in her mouth and suddenly anything seems possible. Her sister Emily tracks her down and reminds her who she really is and how she must be.Emily is used to having her own way but for once Gillian decides to fight back and a battle of wills ensues. Strawberry Fields takes the play ‘A Streetcar Named Desire’ as its starting point, this time told from Stella’s point of view. Complex entanglements and the destructive, manipulative games of a jealous sister makes Strawberry Fields an unsettling rites of passage film, bursting with energy, sex, humour and dark turns.",
