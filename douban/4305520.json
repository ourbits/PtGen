    "introduction": "Reality is more like Oliver Twist, less like Annie, \"Godisnja doba\" or \"Four Seasons\" is one among only few movies made by one of the leading Croation directors of documentary film. It contains three stories connected only by the fact that main characters are girls from an orphanage. The name of the movie is hard to understand: if the number of stories and girls were four it could make sense, as well as if the stories covered a year of their lives. But each of the stories picks up an important but short piece of their lives, a few months in first, and only few weeks in other two stories, and the director handles them as he does in his documentary works, emphasizing essential moments, and leaving emotions covered (yet provoking them in viewers), because emotions aren't something you can expect to be developed in orphanages.",
