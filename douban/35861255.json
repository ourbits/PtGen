Inside the custody centre, the complacent and narrow-minded lawyer Tilda Renström realises that the unknown refugee she is about to deport, has a razor-sharp eye for crime and clues. Tilda, who was recently fired from her job as a prosecutor, suddenly sees an opportunity to secretly present his thoughts as her own, in order to regain her self-esteem and perhaps even her job. The Somalian man is considering helping her, but only if can get something in return.",
