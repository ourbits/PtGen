    "introduction": "The humorous crime series is based on a radio play that is now more than 30 years old. The protagonist is an old-school private detective who solves bizarre cases. His style recalls that of detective Philip Marlowe, created by US author Raymond Chandler. It’s probably no coincidence that the name of the Swiss detective in the radio play resonates with his US colleague: Philip Maloney.",
