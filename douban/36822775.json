    "introduction": "Tsvetaev taught art history at Moscow University and initially conceived the new museum as an educational one. So that in one hall there is Antiquity, in another - the Middle Ages, in the third – the Renaissance. I planned to place copies instead of the originals. Plaster casts were made from the original sculptures exhibited in museums of European capitals by Tsvetaev's order. Dozens and hundreds of casts of giant statues, entire monuments, as well as columns, gates, and tombs were brought to Moscow. The plaster was tinted to look like marble, bronze, wood – so that it was exactly the same.",
