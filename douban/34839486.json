The Boy's cunning choice of words and despairing situation rip the President's heart right out of his chest, so much so that he and the first lady decide to cryptically reach back out to let The Boy know the true impact of his words. As their indivisible bond strengthens, the stakes are about to get raised once again when the boy realizes he's been left with an inheritance of epic proportions - like never before.",
