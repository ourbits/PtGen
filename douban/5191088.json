She gets a job at a small town diner and attempts to establish new relationships. However, the shame over her past mistakes prevents her from getting close to anyone. Then, an unlikely friendship with a kind hearted co-worker, Mani, and a romance with a young, drifter musician named Max challenge Josie to recognize that she can't hide from her past forever. These unlikely connections give Josie the strength to reconnect with the young son she thought she had lost forever.",
