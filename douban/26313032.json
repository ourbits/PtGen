    "introduction": "Bob the Tomato is surprised to find Larry the Cucumber in a book club with Mr. Lunt, Archibald Asparagus and Jerry Gourd. They're reading \"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" by Mark Twain. Well, not the book itself. Bob is dismayed to find they're all just reading notes about the book. Even that was a waste of time, Mr. Lunt decides, when it turns out the dramatized story of the day is \"Huckleberry Larry and Tomato Sawyer.\" The story proves to be a very veggie version of the classic tale. Larry plays Huckleberry Larry, who wants to build a turkey jerky theme park. Bob is Tomato Sawyer who dreams anachronistically of a career in income tax preparation. Big Jim is a sweet-natured but intimidatingly large yellow gourd on the lam. Clark Wayne is the narrator, looking simultaneously like Mark Twain and Col. Sanders. The moral of the story comes from James 4:17: \"If you know what is right to do, but you do not do it, you sin.\"",
