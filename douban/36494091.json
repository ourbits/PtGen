    "introduction": "A gripping documentary that chronicles the extraordinary journey of Ukraine as it stands its ground against the might of Russia during the invasion of February 2022. The acclaimed filmmakers behind Oscar winner “Navalny” and the Oscar-nominated “The Square” and “Hell and Back Again”, Karim Amer, Mike Lerner and Odessa Rae, bring us behind the scenes with key figures in Ukraine’s government. Amidst the chaos and uncertainty, Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba and his colleagues navigate the areas of diplomacy and disinformation on an ever-shifting geopolitical landscape. With unparalleled access to these determined leaders, the film showcases the resilience and spirit of a nation that refuses to surrender while offering wider insights into what it means to conduct war in today’s world.",
