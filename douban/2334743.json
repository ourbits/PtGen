    "introduction": "A faux cautionary documentary based on Kenneth Anger's book Hollywood Babylon that portrays several notorious celebrity sex scandals from the golden age of Hollywood through film clips and often humorous softcore reenactments. Like the book, the movie covers both real and rumored scandals. The movie consists of sexploitational vignettes narrated by the semi-serious narrator. Some of the real life people portrayed in the movie are not named directly but its heavily implied who they're suppose to be. The movie focuses on Olive Thomas, Wallace \"Wally\" Reid, Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle, Marion Davies and the Thomas H. Ince incident, Charlie Chaplin and Lita Grey, Rudolph Valentino, Marlene Dietrich's bisexuality, Erich von Stroheim, and Clara Bow.",
