    "introduction": "Tangier. Fatema, a mother of a nine-year old boy, has just been released from prison. Now, she wants to get to Andalusia in time for strawberry season. For Fatema, Spain is an Eldorado, offering the dream of making enough money to restart her life with her son—a second chance she does not want to miss. But once there, she is quickly caught up in reality. Fortunately, she befriends Amina, Saida and Khadija, women from the countryside. Together, they face hard work in the greenhouses, deplorable living conditions, and constant harassment. In isolation, they survive in a place where they do not speak the language and do not know their rights. La más dulce tells the story of how these four women speak out, denouncing their experiences at the risk of losing everything.",
