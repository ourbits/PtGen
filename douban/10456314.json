    "introduction": "One week each year Iranians stay out all night. Women abandon legal curfews. Men weep. Communities gather to mourn their saint’s death, ask that wishes be granted, give thanks for prayers answered. While this week showcases Iran’s most restrictive religious elements, it offers openings for this culture’s most intimate connections. Is a change in the perception of love inherently political because it affects individuals and their view of the world? As we follow three couples negotiating love, we learn freedom is not what we assume it is and love is more than we imagine it to be.",
