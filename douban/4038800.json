    "introduction": "This plodding and pretentious feature from Spain is based on an ancient Roman myth. Acteon watches as the Diana the goddess of hunting bathes in the nude. This is the second feature directed by Jorge Grau, who would later make his mark in horror films. It started in Czechoslovakia at the festival in Karlovy Vary [where he was exhibiting his 1964 experimental film Acteón]. Someone told me the story of Countess Bathory and it made a great impression on me. It seemed like a feminine version of Faust, that desperation to preserve youth and beauty by a person with power and wealth.Jorge Grau, born in Barcelona, was one of members of La Escuela de Barcelona with films like the avant-garde \"Acteon\" (1965). Formed in Italy, he shows reflexive and rested solidity in his narration, very much in syntony with the time, and great actors direction, matter to which he dedicated a book.",
