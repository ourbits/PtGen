Amnesia is a story about survival, love, friendship and overcoming daunting odds. The events are based on true documented violations of human rights, both in mental institutions and at the hands of human traffickers. Ultimately, this movie is about human rights... the rights we have as beings, to freedom, happiness and dreams.",
