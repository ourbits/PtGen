    "introduction": "An elegant mapping of Lisbon’s labyrinthine streets, where fictional situations juxtapose with the real-life theatre of the city during a warm summer. João Pedro Rodrigues and João Rui Guerra da Mata are back.Like an improvised piece of jazz music from the 60s, this deceptively simple but enigmatic film moves through Lisbon’s narrow streets and green parks to its very own beat. In their idiosyncratic mapping of the beautiful Portuguese capital, director duo João Pedro Rodrigues and João Rui Guerra da Mata let small, fictional situations in the urban space they can see from the window of their shared home. The same streets that in 1963 set the scene for Paolo Rocha’s modern classic ‘The Green Years’ – an iconic film with cult status for generations of cineastes. With an almost geometric symmetry to the compositions, this is an elegant cinematic experience that invites your mind on an adventurous holiday.源自：https://cphdox.dk/film/where-is-this-street-or-with-no-before-and-after/",
