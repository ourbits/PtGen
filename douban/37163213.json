    "introduction": "There is only one thing Margot Juby cares about more than poisonous plants and doll-collecting, and that's seeing her life's work completed: the exoneration of the world's oldest serial killer and gothic supervillain, Gilles de Rais. Armed with fresh evidence, she won't rest until everyone knows: de Rais was a medieval hero, and the most handsome man in the world. A quirky, docu-fairytale brought to life through hand-illustrated animation, The Martyr paints a sinister-yet compassionate-portrait of two outcasts, and the obsession that binds them. In an era of true-crime fever and cancelled kingpins, the film leads us to wonder: what does it mean to love your hero-when they might be a monster?",
