He seems to be the ultimate narcissist, but is in fact quite the old-fashioned romantic at heart. His late, beloved father had set daunting conditions for anyone who wished to marry Victor. His first spouse had passed the test, but their marriage has since collapsed, and they are both seeing other people. When Victor meets a French doctor who strikes him as spouse material, he is surprised to discover that the French doctor's deceased mother had set her own daunting conditions for anyone who wished to marry the doctor. For the first time in his life, Victor resolves to swallow his pride and do whatever it takes to achieve his happily ever after.",
