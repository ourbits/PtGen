    "introduction": "Set immediately after the London bombings in 2005, the series will focus on the manhunt for a group of would-be terrorists and the tragic killing of the innocent Brazillian, after he was mistaken as a suspect. His 2005 murder is seen as one of the great British miscarriages of justice and the Met Police was found guilty in 2007, with Commissioner Ian Blair resigning shortly afterwards. De Menezes’ parents and other relatives are among those serving as consultants for the series.",
