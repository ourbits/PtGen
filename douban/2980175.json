In \"Off the Record,\" Gould revels in his freedom from the public at his college retreat near Lake Simcoe, Ontario, and plays for an audience of one: his collie. In \"On the Record,\" Gould arrives in New York for a recording session, joking and bantering as he reveals his role as a vigorous, sensitive, and critical creator and interpreter of music.",
