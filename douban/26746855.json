Thies knows the game; he works for a real estate management and monitors compliance with the rules - until he meets Bruno and Sonia. Under the hood, it concerned the unequal siblings a free apartment. And begins an affair with his brother. Step by step he delves deeper into the mystery of the \"sisters\" one. A Berlin film about a loner who becomes entangled. About a couple with unexplained residence status. About a city where everyone wants to live.",
