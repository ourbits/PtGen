    "introduction": "In this series, author and journalist Simon Reeve travels to Central Asia to \"meet the Stans\" - Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. His journey provides viewers with a unique insight into these countries' culture and politics. As well as discovering a region teeming with Islamic militants, ruthless tyrants and radioactive wastelands, Reeve also finds a more absurd side to these obscure countries, including an American military base that sells Soviet knick-knacks, a desert full of shipwrecks and a first-rate Beatles tribute band.Part Two: Kyrgyzstan - It is the only country in the world with both an American and a Russian military base and Simon, not wanting to play favorites, visits both of them. Simon also meets a member of a banned radical Islamic group before putting on a (not very) protective suit to visit one of the world's most highly radioactive sites.",
