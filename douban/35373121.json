When she arrives, she finds that the team consists only of a sound engineer and a recording supervisor; Milan has locked himself in a hut for “creative” work, which he does not want to leave.Will the great director and champion of “cinéma verité” actually shoot a film with Céline, or has he lured her to the archipelago for a different reason?",
