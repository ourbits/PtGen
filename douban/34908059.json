    "introduction": "Many Somali refugees dream of a better life in the United States. They are called Bufis or Daydreamers. For men like Assad, this is a business opportunity. When the U.S. Embassy opens the green card lottery, he creates fake families out of dispersed refugees. He’s the best in Nairobi. Thanks to his creativity, his experience as an acting coach and his connections at the embassy, he has sent hundreds of fake families to the United States. This time, he chooses a former warlord, a runaway bride, a prostitute and a widower and his son to create a fake family. Assad is the only person who knows their real identity. With his and his team’s help, this group of misfits will achieve much more than a new life and a brighter future – they will go through a process of healing. But the members of this fake family must stay focused and give their best performance. Like the characters, we are all ready to fight for our dreams, especially when we finally understand what they are.",
