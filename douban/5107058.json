    "introduction": "Whimsical comic fantasy from Norway. Markus, 12, bespectacled and of restricted stature, superstitious and given to confabulation, is understandably held in low esteem within his peergroup. Even his best friend calls him Mousy \"for his own good\", and he has to lie about having a black belt in judo before his so-called \"mates\" will let him peep on the girls in the showers. To cap it all, like in Lad isbjørnene danse, his (widowed) father is a serious liability in the coolness stakes.One day Markus sees a paparazzi shot of Diana Mortensen, tragic heroine of some ghastly Hollywood soap, and feels unwonted protective fantasies welling up inside. Starstruck, he writes to his new idol with a pack of lies and to the amazement of all she promises to come and visit!If Markus is going to meet this jet-setting actress he's going to need a crash course in social sophistication. The story gets more than usually amusing when to Markus's horror his friend Sigmund decides to practise by propositioning two girls from school with a date at the best restaurant in town...",
