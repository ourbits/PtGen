    "introduction": "Part I:DI Dave Creegan is shot and,whilst unconscious,has a near death experience which,on recovery,leaves him with the ability to sense criminals. Joining the Organized and Serial Crime Unit with inspector Susan Taylor, Creegan learns from his friend Cyril,a self-proclaimed psychic,that two recently abducted boys have been murdered 'in the clouds'.In both cases a daffodil has been left at the scene of the abduction,a fact reminiscent of similar crimes in Stuttgart some years earlier. A car at the last crime scene is traced to pharmaceutical chemist professor Ronald Hinks,who lived in Stuttgart at the time of the previous incidents. Creegan arrests Hinks but there is no evidence to suggest his involvement and he is released.Part II:Although Hinks is released Creegan is convinced of his guilt and arranges another interview wherein he gives Hinks a nose-bleed. He uses the tissue that was used to clean up the blood and shows it to Hinks' dog,who then leads him to an abandoned building and the two boys abducted by Hinks. Creegan goes to Hinks' house to kill him but on arrival gets a surprise.",
