    "introduction": "Traitor (BBC, tx. 14/10/1971) was one of the first dramas to explore the lives of the spies 'Kim' Philby, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean, but is much more substantial than a mere roman-a-clef. Although Dennis Potter's fictional KGB mole Adrian Harris (John Le Mesurier) does resemble Philby, his reduced circumstances in Moscow are closer to what happened to Maclean, while the dependence on drink also recalls Burgess's well-known alcoholism. The assassination, however, is clearly patterned after Philby's involvement in the 1945 Volkov affair.",
