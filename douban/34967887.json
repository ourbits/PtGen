    "introduction": "The little bird has plenty of peace and quiet high up in its tree, at least until an unexpected guest shows up. The brash caterpillar’s keen on devouring the green leaves that the little bird has cared for so tenderly. During the ensuing showdown, the two fail to notice that someone else is hard on their heels, and this character’s craving a more savoury snack. Lena von Döhren’s chirping hero graces Generation screens for the third time.",
