The ambitious eldest, Gerhard, and the lazy second-born glutton Gebhard, who struck a deal to help him and be allowed to continue his parasitical lifestyle, cheat and bring home mediocre carpets, trusting the generally-mocked Gustav, a kind and helpful animal lover, won't find anything as his feather drifts into the forest. But a magic wood cave dweller, which he once saved as a frog, gives him a champion carpet. The trusted court marshal Julius, who considers naive, simple Gustav childishly unfit, convinces the monarch to disqualify the results and set a new quest, but the pattern is repeated.",
