Twelve years after their last meeting, Kaatali is forced to contend with the expectations of someone from a different time in her life, stirring up emotions that are more than skin deep. An intimate portrayal of a chance, lopsided reunion, Aftercare touches on themes of memory, reconciliation, and the importance of children’s relationships.",
