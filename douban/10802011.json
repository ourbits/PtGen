    "introduction": "Jan, a guy in his twenties, and his friend Cracker, are involved in several crimes in their neglected suburb of the city. After meeting the \"golden youth\" beauty, Sabina, he looks for a fresh start in the downtown circles, but finds contempt. His hopes for love, compassion and opportunity are dashed by the even more ruthless rules of the bourgeois, and all he can count on is himself and his old friend.\"People Out There\" is the first movie produced with the support of the State of Latvia that was made in Russian. However, this movie is not so much about the soviet style suburbs of \"Purvciems\" or about Latvians and Russians - the run down suburbs reflect the inner world of its characters, it's an allegory for the place where they try to find their identity, their own place in this life. \"People Out There\" is a movie about people here, in contemporary Latvia.",
