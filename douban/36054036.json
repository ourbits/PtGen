Bags are packed and the Morgans are looking forward to spending two relaxing weeks at the beautiful resort in Australia's Far North Queensland. Upon their arrival, it's everything they hoped for and more - until Aria goes missing from the resort's Kidz Club and it becomes their worst nightmare. Suspicions point everywhere, but ultimately the heart pounding race to find the little girl alive leads Savannah to the discovery of a hidden family secret, one that's about to change her life forever.",
