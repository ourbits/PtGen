    "introduction": "Stand-up comedian Paul Virzi is back with his third full comedy special, \"Reasonable Man.\" In this new hour, Paul holds nothing back and delivers brutally honest and hilarious takes on the losing battle that is arguing with women, Italian stereotypes in Hollywood, new Barbies, and his frustration with young pilots. Having already produced specials with Comedy Central and Netflix, Paul goes for a more grassroots approach to his newest collection of material. Not having to worry about the industry red-tape or pleasing suits behind a desk, Paul gives a no-holds-barred, \"anything goes\" performance that fans and peers alike are calling his best work yet. Filmed at the Den Theatre in Chicago, IL.—Paul Virzi",
