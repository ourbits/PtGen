    "introduction": "The film is a global conversation from Iceland to Indonesia between Jeremy Irons and scientists, politicians and ordinary individuals whose health and livelihoods have been fundamentally affected by practices such as landfills and incinerators. Visually and emotionally the film is both horrific and beautiful: an interplay of human stories and ecological disruption. But it ends on a message of hope: showing how the risk to our survival can be averted through sustainable pathways that provide economic solutions while protecting our air, water and food resources.",
