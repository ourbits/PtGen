    "introduction": "Emma is whisked away in the dead of night, covered in bruises and unexpectedly pregnant. Finding a new home in a women’s shelter, she rediscovers lost facets of herself. Among the women and children living in the shelter, individual traumas intertwine. Despite their differences, a delicate sisterhood emerges. “A film about women fighting for their self-esteem and independence, facing a world that denies them a voice. The film takes viewers behind the walls of a women's refuge and shows them a surprisingly vibrant world where lives are being rebuilt. If there is pain, there is also strength, joy and hope. The characters and their stories are rooted in real experiences and emotions, played by a mix of actors and non-actors. Emotional honesty is essential”. Director’s note.",
