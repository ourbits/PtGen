    "introduction": "Reconvergence is an epic rumination on the nature of modern human existence, identity, and consciousness. The film unfolds via the insights of four unique individuals with distinct perspectives on these subjects: historian Waite Rawls, naturalist Eustace Conway, neuroscientist Preston Estep, and poet Caleb Whitaker. Through their observations we embark on an expedition through the very essence of human experience. At once ethereal and firmly grounded in reality, this psychotropic documentary tackles its heady subject matter with a unique style and visual flair. Director Edward Tyndall's elegant orchestration of the film is a perfect match for David Lowery's magnificent cinematography. The result is a rich and exhilarating movie-going experience that opens up the viewer to distinctive ideas and new ways of thinking about humanity and our place in the universe.- Written by Scott Braid",
