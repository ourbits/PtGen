    "introduction": "A handful of unforgettable characters set out on a 100-day quest to tame a totally wild mustang for a Texas competition in this stunning and poignant documentary. Among them: Charles, a Navajo grandfather out to re-capture his youth; George, a grizzled cowboy with a stubborn streak; and Wylene, a blond beauty with a theatrical flare and a nerve of steel. In three months, man and horse must transform from scared strangers to close companions. It won't be an easy journey. Bones and egos will take a beating. Fear and frustration will weed many out. But those who prevail may find themselves desperately vying to keep their horses when they ultimately all go up for adoption at a public auction.",
