That's why, although everybody knows her as a talented tattoo artist, she is also a \"dream consultant\": anybody affected by a recurring nightmare can come by her studio for a free visit. After investigating both in her clients' world of dreams and in reality, she climbs down the clients' unconscious to set them free from that particular nightmare. But Vera has a further motivation: finding and killing the evil presence who murdered her grandmother.",
