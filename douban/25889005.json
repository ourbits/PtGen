    "introduction": "In the heart of rural Australia, thirteen year old Jack reluctantly learns to shoot a rifle at the insistence of his overbearing father. They arrive home from a day of shooting to the disapproving eye of his mother, prompting yet another argument between the parents. Jack and his younger sister, Alana, have become accustomed to the constant fighting in their home. With tensions mounting, Jack grows frustrated at his mother's denial, and with his father's attempts to buy back the family's love after each violent outburst. As his father's temper grows more volatile, Jack must find the courage to stand up to his father, or allow the cycle of violence in his family to continue indefinitely.",
