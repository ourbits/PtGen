    "introduction": "A detailed look at the events that led to the continuous strikes that shut down many factories during the still repressive days of the military regime. The workers union, led by syndicalist Lula, demanded better work conditions and better payments, fighting not only against their exploitative bosses but also the political establishment of the time. Crowds were gathered, protests and marches were planned, constantly followed by the police but the workers bond and strategy was so strong and efficient that everything turned out in their favor, with peaceful movements and no casualties on both sides.",
