    "introduction": "This film discusses the main character’s journey to home through the perspective of a diseased ghost. It connects the time horizon across hundreds of years and overlaps the past and present. From the eyes of the ghost, the piece presents medieval religion intertwining with modern politics, people from all walks of lives including politicians and philosophers from both the East and the West. As socialism collides with capitalism, Eastern classics philosophy merges with Western civilization and raises the question of if Utopia under Communism actually exist! Using the collective narrative of Eastern mystery and Western pragmatism, the film tells a story an absurd yet ultra-realistic tale of politics and anthropology.",
