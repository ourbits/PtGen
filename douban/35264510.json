    "introduction": "We follow a pack of wolves on Ellesmere Island, in Canada's far north, as they struggle to raise their pups in the brief arctic summer. Hidden in her den, the alpha female of the pack gives birth to a new generation. Time is of the essence: her pups need to grow quickly and they have much to learn if they are to survive the merciless winter ahead.",
