    "introduction": "A mockumentary revolving around the attempts of an artist to reflect, through a strange documentary, the presence of foreign students in the city of Barcelona. Mi loco Erasmus reflects the process of a creator who wishes to make his dream come true: to complete the project, which is moving further and further away from reality. The problem is that he doesn’t have the money to do it and no one understands the documentary, and only a friend seems willing to help him.",
