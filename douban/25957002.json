Whilst playing a woman dying of cancer, Muis her doctor tells her she has not much more time left. She will die soon.

We watch Leonoor become physically frailer but mentally stronger as she is slowly accepting her faith. Whilst ending the film, she leaves her film sisters, her real life husband and children but also the viewer, behind forever.",
