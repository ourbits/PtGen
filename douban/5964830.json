    "introduction": "A French independent film, made by Georgian director Nino Kirtadze, depicts the human tragedy of the Chechen conflict as seenthrough the eyes of four veteran reporters. Their testimonies reveal the absurdity and hopelessness of the current situation and their own frustration as they watch civilians die on a daily basis in a war largely outside the concern of the West.The documentary was awarded numerous prises, including Prix Europa, 2001, Festival au Sloop, 2001, FILA, 2002 and Adolf Grimme Award in Gold, which is considered the \"Oscar\" of German Television.",
