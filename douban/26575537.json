    "introduction": "The brain-child of director George Lucas, ILM has come a long way since its inception in 1975 when Lucas was armed with one million dollars, an ambitious script and a dream that would become STAR WARS, the worldwide pop culture phenomenon. George Lucas and ILM forever changed the way films are made while inspiring a new generation of both film-makers and scientists who now work to shape the future, both onscreen and off. RAIDERS, RAPTORS AND REBELS features interviews with artists, scientists, technicians, directors and actors as they tell the stories behind some of the world's favorite movie moments from JURRASIC PARK to STAR WARS and INDIANA JONES with exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of this summer's blockbuster, Marvel's THE AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON.",
