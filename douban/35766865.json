    "introduction": "The ice road is closed!Philosophical, meditative, ironic documentary without additional questions or explanations.In 325 BC Greek geographer Pytheas walked on the frozen ocean. 2348 years later Arko Okk stands on the edge of the sea, which provides a risky shortcut for drivers. Guardian of the ice road, Jaanus can’t promise that the crossing will be open tomorrow but registers all numbers of passing cars and bikes. The mayor is worried about each centimetre of the melting ice.A melancholic, metaphorical, and anthropologic portrait of inhabitants, for whom the ice brings fun games or improvised competitions. We hear carefully recorded footsteps on the snow, mighty wind, and raindrops and perhaps feel the cold through the screen.Eight years of filming on the 3.3 km Noarootsi – Haapsalu ice road delivers a monumental experience of unstoppable passing time.Edvinas Pukšta源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/the-ice-that-still-supports-us/",
