    "introduction": "This is a wonderful documentary movie about Butoh-dancer-legend Kazuo Ohno. I hesitated to upload it for a long time because my TV-rip isn't of very good quality and I was always waiting Arte would show the movie again so I could record it again in higher quality. But well, I am sure some people like to see the film anyway.It's a German movie, so there will be some introductory talk and some voiceovers in German, but the other parts of the movies mostly consist of talks in English or in Japanese with an English interpreter sitting next to the people talking in Japanese - so you will be able to understand pretty much without knowing any German. And even if you dont understand anything, the film is just worth it for the wonderful material showing Kazuo Ohno.",
