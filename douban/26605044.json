    "introduction": "Mughal emperor Humayun (Ashok Kumar). Advocating communal harmony, a policy prompted by contemporary developments, the film stresses the friendship between the victorious Babar (Nawaz) and the defeated Rajputs; he asks the Rajkumari (Veena), daughter of the slain Rajput King, to assume her father's throne and to regard Babar as a father. In the latter part the story, Humayun sacrifices his kingdom to save the Rajkumari. Hamida Bano (Nargis) is a commoner with whom Humayun falls in love, but who turns down his offer of marriage claiming that women, for all kings, are mere playthings. The major highlights of the film are the elaborate Mughal sets and the spectacular battle scenes with elephants and horses. Cecil B.DeMille described the film, in a letter to the film-maker, as a 'masterpiece of lighting composition.",
