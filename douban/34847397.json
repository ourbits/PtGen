    "introduction": "Maria is a Greek policewoman. She is struggling with money problems, her teenage daughter, her old mother and the crisis in her country that also affects her professionally. The police station where she works is shut down and she has to accept a new job at a refugee camp on the island of Lesbos, far away in the Aegean Sea. Yussof is a young Syrian rebel who fled his war-ridden country so as not to be forced to kill. Before he can continue further across Europe, he lands in the refugee camp where Maria works. They meet… Greece looks like a safe haven, but in reality it isn’t. Who is more free? The person who fled war or the person who grew up in a free world?",
