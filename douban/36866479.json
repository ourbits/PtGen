    "introduction": "Through a dialogue between movement and landscape, Lazarus reflects on the objectification of the woman body in film. The famous quote by Edgar Allan Poe \"the death of a beautiful woman is, unquestionably, the most poetical topic in the world\" triggers a succession of falls and recoveries that escape the poetic by trying too hard to find it.",
