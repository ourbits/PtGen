    "introduction": "Michael Cockerell presents this documentary revealing a remarkable year leading up to the General Election. Cameras have been given unique access to the House of Commons and the result is a vivid and extraordinary picture of what goes on behind the scenes, providing a profound insight into how our democracy works. Following everyone from MPs to doorkeepers, and clerks to clockmakers, Inside the Commons explores how the nation’s most important – yet largely unexamined - institution really works. We follow MPs from different shades of the political spectrum as they navigate the machinery of the House of Commons to fight their constituents’ battles. We experience the challenges faced by the staff of the House as they strive to keep the country’s most iconic and historic building functioning as a modern parliament. This is the heart or our democracy as never seen before.",
