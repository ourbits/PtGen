    "introduction": "Just one year into her marriage, Teresa (she/her) hopes her honeymoon in the tropical paradise of Bocas del Toro, Panamá will be the pinnacle of her relationship thus far. Yet, upon arrival, her perception of her husband Drew (he/him) as a people-pleasing golden boy begins to push her to the edge. Stripped of the routines that barely sustain their newlywed bond and unwilling to confront her true feelings, Teresa becomes captivated by Paz (they/them), a free-spirited expat who manages their vacation rental. In an impulsive attempt to reignite their fading connection, Teresa suggests a wild way to spice up their marriage.",
