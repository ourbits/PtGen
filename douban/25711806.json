    "introduction": "2009年8月8日的一場風災，讓原居住於世外桃源的410位村民，永遠沉睡在黃土之下。親人的哭聲劃破天際，一夕間小林滅村的悲難成為國際注目的焦點。重建小林是馬總統的使命，但一分為三的永久屋卻撕離了原本樸質的小林人。本片紀錄6對夫婦災後生計重建的心路歷程及孩童對災難的記憶，是小林滅村後僅存者的故事縮影。A disastrous storm on August 8th, 2009, destroyed a utopia, as 410 lives were buried in a split second under the soil of their home. With the cries of the agonized families crossing the sky, the tragedy of Hsiaolin Village caught international attention. President Ma took the reconstruction of Hsaiolin Village as his personal mission, and yet the tri-parted permanent housing split and divided the otherwise rustic and innocent villagers. This documentary is a record of how the survivors reconstruct their lives.",
