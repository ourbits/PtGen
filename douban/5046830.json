    "introduction": "Baker Lake, west of the Hudson Bay in Canada. A Finnish researcher of Arctic nature and his Inuit assistant are joined at a remote station by a female expert on muskox. Lehmuskallio found in this space a new landscape and a new world: “It is a reduced stage, where only the human figure breaks the horizon.” An inuksuk is a type of stone monument, used by Inuits in caribou hunting as an image of man. The director collides different attitudes once again—between modern civilization and traditional ways of life, between science and art—in a film with an almost surrealist narration.源自：https://doclisboa.org/2023/en/filmes/inuksuk/",
