    "introduction": "Jacob is a First Nations man living on the Rez hours from the nearest city. He lives a pretty simple life working the farm and helping his daughter Tara though for her it is very much about the 21st century right down to the worshiping of teen idols. Tara wins a contest to go into the city and have dinner with her hero Brad, who's premiering his new movie that weekend. Jacob volunteers to drive her to the city to find that Brad is a no show for the dinner; so, they spend the evening with Brad's sister who's apologetic. Not used to city food, Jacob goes out on the town to find something he likes and ends up running into Brad; who's on heroin and picking fights with everybody. They squabble, Jacob beats the trunk of their car; and the next day takes him back to the reserve. Jacob explains to his family that he's going to leave Brad in the woods until he's cleaned up his act and deals with his family issues. Meanwhile, Brad's wife has left him and taken his son. Over the next month with police looking for Brad, he slowly comes clean and becomes to see the world for what it is.",
