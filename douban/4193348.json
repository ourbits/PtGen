    "introduction": "Screen Pioneer's No. 3 is dedicated to the filmmaker Raul Ruiz and includes a rare documentary on him, written by film scholar Ian Christie. This brillant and eccentric short directed by Keith Griffiths, outlines Ruiz's work, biography and preoccupations and includes a rare interview with the director.The documentary leads into the Ruiz's short film The Return of a Library Lover / Lettre d'un cinéaste ou le retour d'un amateur de bibliotèques made in 1983 on the occasion of his first return to Chile since his exile in 1973.Ruiz, rediscovering the things of his past in Chile ten years after the Coup, regards them now with the eyes of another world. This other world is cinema, the mechanical gaze of a Super 8 camera. This eye sees very deeply, even beyond reality and brute memory.'Lettre d'un cinéaste' is the documentary version of a Ruizian fiction: a survivor returns to the land of the dead and discovers his doubles and phantom friends",
