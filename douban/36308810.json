    "introduction": "In July 2021, the scandal breaks over the Israeli surveillance software Pegasus. The international media consortium coordinated by Forbidden Stories reveals an out-of-control global spying system used by more than 65 countries on the telephones of thousands of journalists, lawyers, human rights activists, heads of State, and political opponents around the world. By interviewing the various actors, Anne Poiret's \"Project Pegasus, un espion dans votre poche\" retraces the months leading up to the revelation of the investigation and highlights the authoritarian excesses of States as well as the violations and repercussions on the private lives of individuals.源自：https://fifdh.org/en/2023/film/197-pegasus-un-espion-dans-votre-poche",
