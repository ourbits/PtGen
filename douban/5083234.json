    "introduction": "Jolly Paupers combines the rare talents of the Warsaw Art Players under the leadership of Zygmunt Turkow. In this musical comedy, the famous comic duo Dzigan and Shumacher play two small town \"entrepreneurs\" who believe they have struck oil in a local field. The whole town finds out and thus begins a comedy of errors, including millionaire investors, Amercian schemers, and insane asylums (not to mention a little matchmaking on the side). Yet in the face of setbacks, these two simpletons are relentless in their efforts to escape their misery and achieve fame and fortune and refuse to give in to despair.During the last years preceding the outbreak of World War II, the Dzigan and Shumacher comedy revue theatre gained immense popularity. Their satirical monologues and skits provided Jewish audiences with an escape and a rare opportunity to laugh.",
