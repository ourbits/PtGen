These two programs shot during the duo's Australian tour in 1971 at GTV9 studios have not been televised in entirety since the shows were recorded. Featuring famous dialogues, musical numbers and irrelevant sketches, laugh yourself silly and remember why these two are considered amongst the world's very best comedy talents.",
