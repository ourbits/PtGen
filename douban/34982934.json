The studio workers of Shaw Brothers are on strike for better pay and to support workers who have been sacked, they organised a variety show to collect funds and donations. During the show, Malaysian film legend P Ramlee and his best friend Jamil Sulong wrote an iconic Raya song (Festival song) that is still sung today during the Raya Festival of Eid every year. Four other stories and sub-plots help the movie move forward.",
