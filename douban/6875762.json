    "introduction": "This animated fantasy film follows the adventures of a young elf boy named Dante who is destined to be king and his sworn protector, a noble warrior-turned-outlaw named Landon Wanderer. When Dante's prophecized kingship turns out to be part of a much larger and more sinister scheme, the young elf's future as king goes from being the stuff of dreams to that of an unavoidable nightmare. As events unfold, Dante begins to change into something scheming and wicked, and the hero who once swore to love and protect him now finds himself vowing to stop him at all costs. Monsters from the fantasy genre abound in the form of goblins, trolls, dwarves, elves, and more in this dark re-imagining of the age-old \"boy who would be king\" tale. While the tone is at times dark and grim, there are still precious moments of humor, humanity, and a sense of wonder at a world far more fantastic than our own. Written by Larry Longstreth",
