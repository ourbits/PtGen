    "introduction": "In this character-driven thriller, Nelson Stewart wakes up after a car accident to discover the pages of an unfinished manuscript in his apartment. Haunted by its story of a child kidnapped over thirty years ago, Nelson publishes the manuscript under his own name and achieves literary stardom - until Detective Monroe comes knocking. It turns out Nelson's manuscript is more than fiction: it is identical to the decades-old kidnapping of a boy named Tommy Brannigan. Now, Nelson's only hope of protecting his family is to find the true author of the manuscript and discover what really happened the day Tommy was kidnapped.",
