The film, the first from the Pilcomayo region and possibly from the Chaco region, which was unknown in Argentina, narrates the journey of the expedition and the daily life of Creole and Pilagá indigenous settlers near the current cities of Las Lomitas and Pozo del Tigre in the Province of Formosa. The material belongs to the archive of the current Museum of World Culture, repository of the collections of the former Ethnographic Museum of Gothenburg in Sweden.",
