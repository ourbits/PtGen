    "introduction": "The Ambin Massif is an acrochore, a group of mountains between the upper Susa valley, the Cenischia valley and Moncenisio, between Italy and France, where fifteen peaks exceed three thousand meters and retain the little ice that has resisted the heating global. The landscape reveals a panorama of seasons and geological eras, a living memory of linguistic diversity, of conflicts, fortresses and aimed cannons, of peaceful sports, exploration of peaks, smugglers, fugitives, hunters, woods and cows, milk and cheeses. This is a changing place with a thousand-year history, a symbol of human and environmental challenges. Ambin is no longer just a word written on maps, when it is observed by those who, like Fredo Valla, know how to tell about it and rescue it from the oblivion of its fragile persistence.",
