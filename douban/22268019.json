The Jukai is a vast, primeval forest that spreads out on the northwestern foot of Mount Fuji, where many have wandered in and never came back. Today it is widely known as a suicide destination. The directors stake out near the Jukai, hoping to find a prospective suicide, talk him out of it and film the whole procedure. While filming people at the abyss of life, Abe and Takeuchi both face problems at home. Through their encounters with people in the Jukai, they re-evaluate their lives and regain their confidence.",
