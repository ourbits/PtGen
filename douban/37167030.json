    "introduction": "Rabe Perplexum was one of the earliest West German artists to live in a non-binary gender identity. A key figure (for all their fringeness) of the Munich scene in the 1980s, Rabe’s paintings and performances were soon forgotten after their too early death at the age of 39. Interest in Rabe has since resurged, with Raganelli’s portrait becoming a key document of this visionary.",
