    "introduction": "This is a Macbeth for our chaotic, fragmented, attention-deficit times. Khavn’s thorough understanding of Shakespeare’s text is beyond question; it would be impossible to create a work of such irrepressible, fiery originality without it. But this is unlike any other adaptation; Makbetamaximus is both a striking work in its own right, and a continuation and expansion of its creator’s artistic statement, which to date includes over 50 features and 200 shorts, eight books of poetry, two short story collections, a novel and 40 albums.",
