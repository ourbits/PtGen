Bob Barr falsely declares, \"Barack Obama has his roots in the Cook County machine.\" Meanwhile, Tucker Carlson claims, \"You can't tell me he spent 18 years there [in Chicago], or however long he spent there, and no stories have resulted from that time.\" Proving that Carlson doesn't bother to read, there is in reality a massive literature about Obama's time in Chicago, all of it disproving the smears asserted in \"Hype.\"",
