    "introduction": "Charles Benzinger seeks a doctor's attention to treat an overwhelming desire to touch everyone he sees. The doctor insists this condition doesn't exist, but Charles soon faces an opposite complication, his inability to touch a passenger on the bus. Ultimately the film is a dramatic comedy about the disconnection in society and one man's struggle to move away from the wired world he lives in. Working from home for as long he can remember, one day the office sends a message. 'We need you to start working in the office.' Panic sets in and Charles finally goes out into the world, only to believe he needs to touch everyone he sees, otherwise suffering severe migraines.",
