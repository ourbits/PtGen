    "introduction": "An activist, a political prisoner, an exile —the life of Guillermo “Willy” Villalobos is pierced by Argentina’s agitated recent history. Now, decades later, Willy lives among the dunes of the small Uruguayan town of Cabo Polonio, and from there, he looks back on his experiences. But the shape of the past is the fragment. The same is true about dreams, which come and go in a disorderly manner like that sand the wind drags, incessantly, toward the houses. These are the formats Martín Farina and Willy Villalobos adopt in Náufrago to tell his story. Without leaving testimonies aside but avoiding linearity and the typical, unflawed tales of activism, a dreamlike experiment is built; a living memory that also embraces the complexity and the contradiction of politics as a subjective experience.",
