    "introduction": "Passers-by is a constructivist, multiple, fragmented and cosmic film... a cinematographic Big Bang resulting from a thorough conception and edition work by Director Luis Aller. Passers-by exposes us to ephemeralness inside hundreds of human beings' lives in their particular evolutions, and allows us to watch them as though we open a wide window over the city of Barcelona, which unfolds before us like a map of crossing lives. The stories are seen as incomplete pieces that get sense when mixing with other ones, also incomplete... That of incomplete, fragmented, anonymous, hazardous, unfinished, that which moves... chaos, there is where the essence of Passers-by lies. Shot initially in 35mm, its more than seven thousand shots montage mixes all cinematographic formats and textures. With thousands of characters crossing and getting lost in countless locations of Barcelona city, and with a shooting extended over two decades, Passers-by has been a challenge in terms of production and has boasted the participation of artistic and technical crew of several generations.",
