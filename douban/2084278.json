    "introduction": "Three soldiers find themselves lost in a seemingly endless forest on enemy soil as World War Two rages around them. Slowly the men run out of food and water, and then slowly lose their senses, turning on one another and fighting for their lives. Shot over two days on a miniscule budget, and featuring the late great horror legend Peter Cushing, join Private Scott (Stuart Brennan - The Bond), as he struggles to understand the will of the forest and escape the madness. The first film from British Phoenix Films, the exciting new Independent British Horror Label, promises to leave you breathless for more... Written by Anonymous",
