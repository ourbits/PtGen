    "introduction": "When Zeke agrees to attend a cookout with his estranged father, Nick, he initially worries that it was a bad idea. Not only is Zeke uninterested in connecting with his dad, but he also struggles to feel comfortable amongst his boisterous black family whose world seems to differ from his own. On the verge of leaving, Zeke is convinced to stay by his half-sister, Dezz, who goes out of her way to make him feel welcome. After witnessing Nick do a comedic re-telling of his colonoscopy, Zeke finally settles in with his family, showing them old photos of himself, and laughing as they roast each other.源自：https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/films/2196772",
