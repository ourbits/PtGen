    "introduction": "At a Berlin secondary school, Max bites off Karim’s earlobe. In the evening, Max’s parents are at the school, sitting down with the principal, the teacher and a school inspector. Max is in danger of being expelled. But the case is not so simple: Max is Jewish, whereas Karim is Muslim and is said to have subjected his classmate to anti-Semitic bullying. In the style of Yasmina Reza’s play God of Carnage, an argument develops with little potential for resolution. A humorous and revealing lesson about cultural barriers, entrenched prejudices and negligently looking the other way.",
