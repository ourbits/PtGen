    "introduction": "Opulent cinematic journey through one of the most beautiful countries in the world. From the snowy icy world of the high mountains with theirs mighty glaciers, thunderous waterfalls and raging mountain streams, through the last primeval forests to the warm steppe lake, this documentary follows the trail of water - the element that has shaped the diverse nature of this country like no other. Water is not only the basis of all life, it has also given Austria some of Europe's most spectacular natural wonders. In deep forests ducklings jump from tall trees to learn how to swim, in inaccessible gorges a prototype of trout has survived, and in raging wild rivers, the world's oldest vertebrate has survived for millions of years. All this is captured in intoxicating images that make the nature and wildlife for the audience at home up close to the experience.",
