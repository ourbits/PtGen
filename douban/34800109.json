    "introduction": "The main character of the film is 14 year old Viktorka (Anna Kaderávková). A typical teenager influenced by mass pop culture. Her way of thinking and acting are mainly determined by mimicking models from the adult world inhabited by celebrities. Viktorka is brought up in such an environment by her single mother. Not surprisingly, she finds substitutes of real life and real relationships in the virtual reality of social networks. A turn in her life happens after the death of her mother, a successful businesswoman. Vicky involuntarily moves to her biological father (Pavel Reznícek), away from a big city that offered her practically everything that came across her mind. Her adaptation to a new surrounding and a \"new\" father brings comical situations that arise from a collision of worlds that seem too far apart to merge.",
