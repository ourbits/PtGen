    "introduction": "Albania, the most impenetrable of the former communist countries in Europe. Isolationist, Stalinist and anti-revisionist. The weight of a memory that more than 30 years after the fall of the regime coexists with all the characters encountered in the film. Musicians, actors, directors, privileged and downgraded, tell the contradictions of a system that has the image of the dictator Enver Hoxha, who like a Great Father has given and taken away. A cumbersome past that accentuates the frailties and ambiguities of the young democracy.Everything that today may seem a parody, was not at the time and Redi Hasa, a cellist musician, begins a journey that starts with memories, the fear of forgetting and the desire to stop time.",
