    "introduction": "A beautiful film about reaching adolescence to watch with a parent.Twelve-year-old Mira is a creative girl with good friends and unique hobbies. But when the new school year starts and she befriends the popular girls in her class, she suddenly feels pressured to change. She has to give up her childish activities and hobbies, update her look to be more mature and, most importantly, start taking an interest in boys! Perhaps all of this is just part of the complicated process of growing up, and the new version of Mira is here to stay. But maybe there’s still a way to be a child for a little while longer?",
