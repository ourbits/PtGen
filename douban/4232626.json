    "introduction": "from tlavideo:Reflecting a social networking-saturated youth culture where YouTubers like William Sledd and Chris Crocker speak directly to millions of kids, including teenage girls and emo boys alike, OMG/HaHaHa offers a deeper, digitally filtered view into the seemingly superficial psyches of the MySpace generation. In the tradition of edgy and cutting edge filmmaking inspired by Harmony Korine, Gus Van Sant, and Greg Araki, OMG/HaHaHa weaves a simple narrative together via part video blog, part improvisational narrative, and part pseudo documentary. The film is a pastiche of the lives of a diverse set of twenty-something gay, straight, and trans teens living in Memphis and dealing with flesh and blood issues, ranging from unexpected pregnancy to homophobia to dying parents.from imdb:An independent coffee shop owner finds out she is pregnant, a transgender girl who runs storytime at a local bookstore has to decide if she's going to go say goodbye to her dying father who violated her for years, a 14yo boy walks around with the weight of the world on his shoulders wondering how he is as a parent to his \"child,\" a boy turns 23 and is told he can't bring his boyfriend of 6 years to his parents' house for a birthday dinner, and a 17yo kid seeks more from life than the rootless, angry household he lives in, trying to shed light on his group of disconnected, cold friends.",
