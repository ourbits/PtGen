    "introduction": "In Gambia, Africa’s smallest country, the basic source of protein, fish, is increasingly scarce. Since the arrival of Chinese companies that transform fish into feed for animals exported to Europe, the country’s traditional fishing sector as well as its food security have been under threat. Three people: Abou, Mariama and Paul, share their intimate stories of survival, longing and migratory treks that leave their mark forever. This project was born from the director’s interest in analysing the motives that drive many migrants to risk their lives by sea in route towards Europe.",
