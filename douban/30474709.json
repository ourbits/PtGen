    "introduction": "妇女咨询妇女。5000名租户住在多特蒙德附近的沙恩霍斯特卫星定居点。她们中有一千多人是独自生活或与子女生活的妇女。他们中很大一部分人靠福利生活。他们需要帮助来维护他们对社会福利机构的权利。这部纪录片以一位26岁的两个孩子的单亲母亲的观点记录了妇女倡议的承诺。“在小组中，我意识到我不是我一直认为的那种孤立的情况。”Women counselling women. Five thousand renters live in the satellite settlement of Scharnhorst near Dortmund. More than thousand of them are women living alone or with their children. A large percentage of them are on welfare. They need help in asserting their rights vis-à-vis the social welfare authorities. This documentary uses the point of view of a 26-year-old single mother of two to document the commitment of the women’s initiative. “In the group, I realised that I am not the isolated case I always thought I was.”",
