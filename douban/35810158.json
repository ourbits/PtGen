    "introduction": "Shot at night under urban lighting, narrated by Lily Cole, \"Night Burns Like Cigarettes\" questions the way we consume the night as if it were nothing but cigarettes. As we have taken the habit of over-consuming, so have we taken the habit of over-lighting our cities for reasons that may not be acceptable.\"Night Burns Like Cigarettes\" is a testimony of love for the night, threatened by disappearance. The night makes us human and allows us to question the boundaries of the self. Meanwhile, our fear of darkness and of the unknown haunts our socio-political history -old story! Hence, the night is being arrested in the mural by Banksy that sits in the Barbican tunnel. British-Zimbabwean singer Kwaye reclaims our right to darkness via an enchanting dance performance. \"Night Burns Like Cigarettes\" is nocturnal ballad in a dreamt London.",
