    "introduction": "Light of the Body is ten minutes long and is composed of five basic elements: l) a dancer, Francine Breen; 2) a pair of internally illuminated fiber optic lights she holds in her hands; 3) a background screen (physical) and a foreground screen (electronic, constructed in the video editing process); 4) external illumination that pulses and flickers at a rhythmic but changing rate; and 5) a music score by Marilys Ernst. So described this videotape sounds simple, but in combination the parts draw the spectator into a series of questions even as the image of the dancer casts a sensual spell.",
