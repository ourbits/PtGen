    "introduction": "Ana Bravo-Pérez embarks on a journey to the origins of the coal that piles up in the port of Amsterdam. She lets the coal’s stench guide her to a mine in the Wayuu territory in northern Columbia. A seemingly endless freight train gives us a sense of how much the region gets exploited by foreign companies. The scope of this exploitation is juxtaposed with two Wayuu women speaking about their spiritual connection to “Mma” (Mother Earth).",
