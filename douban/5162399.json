At school lunch recess, he everyday passes by the same traffic light pole, which, like many others, has lots of kids around juggling tennis balls. One of them is Kiko (Cleslay Delfino), which borrows Leonardo's portable video game. The next day, when her mother asks for the video game, Leonardo goes to the same traffic light and asks Kiko to bring the game back, but it's too late: two bullies from the favela took the electronic game off his hands. Now, Kiko and Leonardo become best friends. Leonardo runs away from home to recover his game and prove to her mother that he's responsible, but his disappearance brings dispair to his family, they think it was a kidnapping.",
