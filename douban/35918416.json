    "introduction": "After the groundbreaking success of Atanarjuat, Zacharias Kunuk made a series of community-focused mid-length documentaries, including this captivating profile on Inuit shamanism, co-directed with Paulossie Qulitalik. (Kunuk would later return to the subject in his stop-motion stunner Angakusajaujuq, also playing in this program.) The film blends footage of Igloolik life with stories, told by on-camera interviewees, of shamanism and the spirit world around us.",
