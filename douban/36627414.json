    "introduction": "A group of young individuals in their mid-20s Kwan, Ploy, and Kawin who, in their newfound and unconventional love, look for a sense of belonging as the world comes to pause. In stillness, they face themselves and confront their personal identities in the shadows of family quarrels and the unforeseen future of their youth and the world. Kwan narrates a personal reflection on a mythical story her mother once told her. A woman who vowed to be born as a Dalha flower for the sake of love. As the myth threads a connection in Kwan's memory of her absent mother, Kwan comes to understand her conflicted identity. Following her mother's footsteps, she decides to embark on a journey in search of change.",
