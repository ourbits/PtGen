    "introduction": "Dream Work does not so much present dream content than filmic methods of representation corresponding to Freudian dreamwork: mechanisms of displacement and condensation are seen in relation to figurative elements found in Tscherkassky’s source material. Tscherkassky processes these in a manner that resembles Freud’s description of the compression (Pressung) of dream thoughts that takes place in the work of dreams, whereby “components are turned, crumble, and get pushed together, like drift ice.”源自：https://www.filmfestival.gr/en/section-tiff/movie/1241/14624",
