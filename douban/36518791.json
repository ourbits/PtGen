    "introduction": "The Riace Bronzes is a documentary that goes through half a century of history, narrating the two best preserved bronze statues in the world, the two mysterious warriors who emerged from the sea in front of Riace in 1972, after two thousand years spent underwater. Interviews and exclusive documents, first-hand testimony and the portrait of a restless present are the heart of this story. Riace Bronzes represent our past but, as everything lost and found, they embody our desires for the future, peace and beauty, that mankind have always had.",
