    "introduction": "Małgorzata Szumowska and Michał Englert once again offer unobvious, original cinema that is difficult to pigeonhole, although there are plenty of cinephilic flavours to be found. ‘All Inclusive’ presents a full package of Polish attitudes, vices and characters. The pretext for looking at compatriots is a large, organised trip to Agadir. The travellers include a praying and prenuptially chaste fiancé, an intellectual philosopher, an incorrigible optimist and a melancholic with a bored partner, but also a Polish patriot and a malcontent who is afraid to touch the hotel cutlery. Characteristic documentary talking heads meet musical scenes and moral-existential drama here, and naturalists meet professional actors such as Andrzej Chyra and Izabela Kuna.",
