    "introduction": "The story of the fictional superhero \"Pérák\" fighting against the Nazi occupiers. Thanks to the feathers on his feet, he can jump over Prague fences, trams and houses. But will his strength be enough even in the moment of unexpected strikes by the new Reich Protector Heydrich? The performance mixes urban legends from the period of the Protectorate with historical reality, and creates a surprising alternative interpretation of history. The VOSTO5 ensemble is famous for its unique theatrical poetics and typical humor, which it also combines with elements of martial arts and stunts. The recording was created as part of the Live project, when the performance was broadcasted live to cinemas from the historic building of the Charles University Law faculty.",
