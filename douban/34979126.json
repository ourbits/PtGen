    "introduction": "Based on a true story, Newton becomes the \"Lord of the Mint\" after the suggestion of John Locke. Newton goes after counterfeiters capturing the 'mastermind', William Chaloner. After Chaloner, defending himself, announced he'd be found not quilty, he bribed the witnesses. Newton began to copy some of the devious methods of Chaloner to bring him down and Newton captured him again and deciding to prosecute Chaloner himself, going head to head. (Via producer David S. Goyer on the Nerdist podcast.)Written By: Bigjl98",
