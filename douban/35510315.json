    "introduction": "Through a fragmented montage, Lumbre paints an elliptical portrait of the accidental death of a child by a stray bullet in the countryside of Mexico. We follow the characters through brief episodes of their lives creating a unity of humor and tone. Mixing the poetic with the political is a bold attempt to explore the possibilities of cinema to analyze violence without resorting to the spectacular tropes that it normally entails. Instead, Lumbre reads the violence that permeates everyday life even in the smallest gestures.",
