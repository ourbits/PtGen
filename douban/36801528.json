    "introduction": "Aumari, a young Eritrean refugee who lives in Israel washing dishes for a living, is caught by the immigration police, and deported to his country. At the last moment he manages to escape at the airport and runs straight into the hands of Maccabi Netanya's soccer fans that mistake him for the new, Nigerian striker who was supposed to land that day.At a glance, Aumari morphs from a transparent refugee into the big star of a city that looks up to him to save the team from being kicked out of the league. There is only one problem: Aumari has no soccer talent. He does, however, have a talent to make friends, to make people laugh and come together. It is through these skills that he manages to make big changes in the team and even find love. However, when Aumari will go back to being a refugee will someone stand by his side, and will he manage, for the first time in his life, to stop running?",
