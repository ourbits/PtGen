    "introduction": "While 2018 saw the latest offering from visionary genre enthusiast Peter Strickland with In Fabric (four years after his deliciously subversive art-house sexploitation homage The Duke of Burgundy), the director seems to be moving forward with Night Voltage, which was originally mentioned several years back. Set in the 1980s New York disco scene, a young Greek-American named Nondas does what he has to do to jumpstart his own electronic music career. Produced through Tristan Goligher of The Bureau, along with David Hinojosa and Christine Vachon, the project is listed as shooting in 2019.",
