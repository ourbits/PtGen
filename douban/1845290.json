He telephones to Moscow and finds out that his wife has left him and that someone has moved in his apartment. He decides to stay in Berlin and does so by staying in no man's lend between two Berlins. His only property is small tea-urn, parade uniform and white bicycle. His first contacts are with black market and underground. And while he makes first moves in the game of survival, we're getting to know his past.",
