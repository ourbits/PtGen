    "introduction": "The new documentary film Separado!-- starring, written, and soundtracked by Super Furry Animals leader Gruff Rhys-- is quite possibly the craziest SFA-related project to date. (If you're familiar with Super Furry Animals' particularly outlandish brand of psychedelic zaniness, you know that calling something \"quite possibly the craziest SFA-related project to date\" really means something.)According to a press release, Separado! follows Gruff's journey through the Welsh community in Patagonia in search of a long-lost relative who happened to be a 1970s Argentine pop star (who sang in Welsh). In an insightful piece in the Guardian, we learn that in the film, Rhys plays music for a gathering of senior citizens while wearing a red Power Rangers-style helmet. According to the Guardian, there is also \"a dance sequence on a Welsh beach\" and \"a color-saturated shot of Rhys jumping over a fence to escape an angry armadillo.\"",
