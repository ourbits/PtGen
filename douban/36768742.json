    "introduction": "The newly commissioned video for the occasion of the exhibition Shadow Citizens assemblage features memories and commentaries of non-professional actors combined with excerpts from films in which they participated as “protagonists,” mixed with footage made of crews working on the sets of Žilnik’s films.It acts as a reminder for Žilnik of the talents and real-life experiences of his participants, which inspired the filmmaker to articulate their narrative threads and also define his fictional characters. At the same time, the video documents how the film participants experienced new encounters and solidarity in the “film collective.”",
