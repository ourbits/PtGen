    "introduction": "From renowned Japanese graphic designer and multidisciplinary artist Awazu Kiyoshi, Furyu (1972) is a testament to the ephemeral beauty of interplaying light and shadow. This experimental 16mm film exhibits the shadows of trees arching and swaying in the wind, visible as eerie shapes on the bare walls of a white house, alongside an evolving soundscape of intensifying oral vibrato and piercing instrumental pitches. A rarely shown sensorial experience.",
