    "introduction": "KO Ahra, a deaf dancer, navigates a world where hearing aids offer only a partial connection to sound. The nuances of speech remain beyond her grasp, and the music that fuels her dancing feels frustratingly distant. Despite these obstacles, KO Ahra embarks on a profound journey: motherhood. Haunted by childhood taunts in music class, she hasn't sung in twenty years. Yet, the birth of her child awakens a long-dormant desire. For the first time in two decades, Go Ara sings a lullaby. This simple act reignites her love for music, prompting her to explore new artistic territories and craft a soundscape that is uniquely her own.",
