    "introduction": "A political filmmaker finds himself in Long Island for a weekend where he finds himself entangled with a high-living, jet set crowd. At first it is exciting, but soon he finds himself disillusioned by their shallowness. The film contains an early performance by Robert De Niro. Footage from Sam's Song was later re-edited into a completely different movie, known as both The Swap and Line of Fire, in which a man investigates the death of his brother. ~ Sandra Brennan, RoviR, 1 hr. 32 min.DramaDirected By: Jordan LeondopoulosIn Theaters: Dec 31, 1969 WideOn DVD: May 2, 2005",
