    "introduction": "A father and son live isolated from the outside world. Following a conflict, a painful family story unfolds. Who is in the right and who is wrong remains a mystery, however - also for the audience. The landscape of Norfolk forms the perfect backdrop to this at times disconcerting but always visually stunning drama.The impressive landscape of Norfolk plays a major role in this allegorical story, in which this timeless, definition-defying no man’s land is inhabited by a disillusioned mercenary and his son.The son spends his days - alone - in nature, where he is constantly observed by a mysterious old couple. In the meantime, his father has set himself one last goal: to exterminate a group of foreign revolutionaries hiding out in a nearby piece of wasteland. While the father closes in on his goal, the son meets the young girl who works for the revolutionaries. A beautiful friendship blossoms between them - one the son, having spent his whole life in isolation, is reluctant to give up.These opposing interests of father and son for this group give rise to an inevitable clash and the son is taken in by the mysterious old people, who turn out to be his embittered grandparents. A family story of pain and betrayal gradually unfolds. Sorting out the good from the bad is left to both the family and the audience.Director Martin Radich chooses an ambitious narrative form with a paradoxical realist-absurdist style. The originality and humanity of the story combined with some sterling acting ensure this is a cinematic experience that will stay with you.",
