    "introduction": "Hollywood had no monopoly on big-budget, star-studded soap operas in 1952, as proven by this Argentine production. Dishonored is the woeful tale of trained nurse, played by Fanny Navarro, who is falsely accused of murder and shipped off to prison for five years. Having been pushed around in the outside world by lechers and mini-dictators, the poor woman finds life even more intolerable behind bars. Fortunately, a new prison administrator enters the scene, advocating understanding and compassion rather than brute force. By this time, however, she is \"great with child,\" busily plotting an escape in the hopes of finding a proper home for her baby and bringing the person responsible for her incarceration to justice. There's a superbly filmed Third Man-style climax in the sewers of Buenos Aires.The Argentine cinema showed a remarkable development during the 40's when very good film directors, actors and actresses opened a new era. Besides, the cinematographic industry being already supported by previous governments was finally established. During the first Peronist period, some productions used to praise the regime, while others tried to avoid a very strict censorship that ranged from compulsory acceptance of actors and subjects to loans administration. The case of the film Director, Daniel Tinayre arouses the interest for a more detailed analysis. Although he organized much of his films during the abovementioned period he achieved an outstanding balance between praising and insulting. He eluded censorship in a very clever way. Deshonra - one of the most important films of Daniel Tinayre and a symbolic film of this period is here studied. It shows the achievements of the peronist government as regards prison policy but at the same time it conveys the feeling of suffocation that the society suffered as a consequence of the political regime in force.",
