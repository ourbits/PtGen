A heartfelt drama about life, dealing with loss; a journey of rediscovery and the hills climbed which forever change us. A compelling, thought provoking story, with an immaculate contrast of darkness and light that is not often found in such stories. Leaving us with the belief that it is never too late to be brand new.",
