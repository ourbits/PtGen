    "introduction": "The main character lives in a town where wearing mask is a sacred and inviolable tradition. He goes to a party one day where people all wear fancy masks, but his mask is plain and white, indicating his low status in the society. He feels inferior. A girl appears, taking off her mask in front of him implying she wants to live in a world where she can see people's faces. Under stimulation the man takes off the mask finally, because he also wants to free himself from this town, but suddenly dancing people descend upon them, and capture them. The Masks alludes to the authoritarian power of the unreasonable but coercive rules in the real society.刘海旭担任编剧、导演、剪辑、音乐创作的短电影《面具》，获全美高中电影节“最佳实验性影片奖”、获phantoacopw film featival电影节最佳影片奖、获2013年Express Reel Film Festical电影节最佳影片奖。",
