    "introduction": "A long-distance coach sets off on a journey through the mountainous landscape of Tajikistan. Each of the guests on board in this slapstick comedy is pursuing a different goal. In their cramped, stuffy bus, the illustrious company runs into several individuals in need of assistance and unanticipated obstacles. An older Russian lady, Natascha,flirts with a mullah. Soviet and Tajik cultures clash. Along the way, the initially unspectacular ride turns into an odyssey into the unknown that will alter the lives of the individual passengers forever.",
