On her birthday, she reflects on the decisions and circumstances that could have led her down different paths. From the age of 17 to this day, her life has been full of small but critical moments. Each was a turning point with dramatic consequences. What would have happened if she had forgotten her passport, chosen a different queue at the shop or driven the scooter that one time...? Is her life a string of coincidences and accidents, or a preordained path?",
