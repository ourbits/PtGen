    "introduction": "DANGER DIVA is a music driven cyberpunk thriller about a hard rocking singer who is coerced into becoming an electronically enhanced new-music diva by her high tech billionaire patron. Set in the near future, her singing voice is used to control and energize the brains of employees that are being used as external hard drives for the corporations' clients. Referred to as Brain Cattle, the workers operate in a digital sweatshop processing binary algorithms and function musically as a chorus for the diva. DANGER DIVA explores the conflict between high tech vs. high touch, and what it means to be human in a digitally enhanced bio-tech future.",
