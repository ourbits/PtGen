    "introduction": "In this three-part series, historian Tracy Borman will examine the final days of Anne Boleyn; the day of her arrest, the day of her trial and the day of her execution. She will steer us through the events of each day hour by hour, examining the evidence to reveal what actually happened. Was Anne really an adulterer or was she tossed aside by a weary King, desperate for a male heir? Did the King’s chief adviser Thomas Cromwell invent a series of incredible charges or were the accusations based on reliable testimony?Tracy will present the latest theories on Anne Boleyn’s story, visiting the locations of major incidents; Greenwich Palace to the Tower of London and Westminster Hall. Drawing on original records and artefacts, she’ll re-examine accepted history and discover the truth about the last days of this iconic queen.S1 E1 ArrestS1 E2 TrialS1 E3 ExecutionProduction Companies: Lion Television / Motion Content Group",
