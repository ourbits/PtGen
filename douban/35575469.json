    "introduction": "What is a knight without his horse? An actor without an audience? A mother without her child? Lucie is all of these things: a working mum and wandering knight, in a film that keeps changing its setting and tone. After a relaxing stay at her grandmother’s house, with whom she leaves her daughter, she suddenly discovers herself in full medieval armour amongst rolling hills. The action then shifts to an empty theatre, where Lucie – in the same suit of armour – awakes amidst the chaotic preparations for a performance of King Lear.Lucie, played by French-Belgian actress Lucie Debay (Melody, King of the Belgians), repeatedly whispers to herself: “Don’t lose track of things.” This debut feature film – by film and theatre maker Claude Schmitz – reflects on life, performance, dreams, and deeds. The Covid-19 pandemic’s effects on the performing arts are implicit, yet unmistakable in the existential undertone of Lucie’s quest.",
