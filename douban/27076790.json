Their relationship lasted for almost eight years before they both decide on an amicable breakup, thinking that this is the best for the both of them. And so the two face the dating world separately, checking up on each other under the guise of “friendship”. This turns into a competition on who will find a new relationship first. One succeeds while the other realizes that she’s still in love with him. This is a relatable relationship story that tries to answer the age-long question – can exes really be friends?",
