    "introduction": "Meticulously crafted, “The Man from Rome” is about a modern-day crusader on a quest to save mankind from darkness. Yet, ultimately his journey boomerangs him back to his own doorstep to confront his inner darkness.Father Filippo (Michele Riodino, winner of the Best Actor at Venice Film Festival 2016 and EFP Shooting Star at Berlin International Film Festival 2010) is a man of contradictions. He is a man of faith but governed by science who is on a mission to save people from lies and deception. When Filippo comes to the small Dutch village, he has a clear and uncompromising motive to expose the myth surrounding the Crying Madonna. Yet, his motives are challenged. At the village, he becomes attracted and unsettled by a mute young woman. As Filippo’s probing eyes are directed more towards the Madonna, his heart sways with doubt about what is true and false until tragedy knocks at his door.Jaap Van Heusden is a Dutch filmmaker and screenwriter whose films have competed and won at international film festivals. Prioritizing drama, Heusden’s oeuvre is simple and complex. He centres the characters in impossible relationships where each mirrors the other and dives deep into their psyche tastefully and artistically.Milani Perera源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/the-man-from-rome/",
