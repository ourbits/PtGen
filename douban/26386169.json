    "introduction": "Without a doubt, Christmas is the most spellbinding time of the year, a great celebration indeed, with presents and parties everywhere, however, do we ever wonder where did all the traditions that we keep until nowadays come from? For instance, when did we start singing carols and decorate the Christmas tree, moreover, why do we hang socks over the fireplace and how did Santa Claus get his red suit and his 8-reindeer sleigh? From the first Christmas lights that consisted of 24 light bulbs and used to cost around 12$, to the family tradition of picking the perfect Christmas tree and from the relation of the darkest day of the year, the winter solstice, with the Roman holiday of Saturnalia, many things have changed and helped the evolution of Christmas to the modern version that we all love. Obviously, all contemporary customs hide old and diverse stories behind them; some of them are of dark and mystical origins, while others are more related to profit and commercialism.",
