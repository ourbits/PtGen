    "introduction": "Exactly three months after headlining a short, Humphrey returned for another Cinemascope outing with Ranger Woodlore. Here at the promise of a warm cooked meal, the large and likable one, along with his fellow brown bears, pick up litter from the park according to a grid that the Ranger has made. Many have fond memories of this cartoon, with good reason. It's a delightful little piece, with catchy music, funny twists, plenty of butt-bumping, and even a cameo by Smokey Bear.",
