    "introduction": "A documentary look back on half a century of collaboration between a popular author's duo ... In 2017, Zdeněk Svěrák and Jaroslav Uhlíř celebrated the 50th anniversary of their collaboration, not only symbolically, but also with a pair of spectacular concerts at Prague's O2 Arena, where thousands of spectators came to listen to their songs. Immortal, almost popular songs like Strašidýlko Emílek , When a Horse falls in love , Cows , Electric Waltz , Statistics and many others came to be sung by parents who \"still\" know the songs, with their children who \"already\" know them. A television documentary by Viktor Polesný , who is the court director of favoritesHours of singing , it balances not only fifty years of cooperation between Zdeněk Svěrák and Jaroslav Uhlíř, but also provides an insight into their author-human relationship and the history of the creation of the most famous songs that still live their own lives.
