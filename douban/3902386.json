    "introduction": "5 stories by Brazilian writer Guimaraes Rosa: in the hinterland of the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, a man fears for his life after having killed one of the dire Brothers Dagobé, outlaws who have great influence over the region; a hitman asks a doctor what's the meaning of a name he has heard; in a farm, the landowner decides to share the use and property of the estate among his employees; a man falls in love with a girl, but she's said to have a dreadful disease; and the local butcher spends half of his time running after his mother and daughter, both utterly mad.Four short stories by the noted Brazilian author Joao Guimaraes Rosa are adapted for the screen in this anthology feature. In the first segment, an outlaw (Caca Carvalho) terrorizing a small town is killed by a mild-mannered fellow. Next, a landowner who has lost his loved ones decides to give his land to the local peasants. In the third story, a farmer develops a sincere but unusual attraction to a servant girl (Giulia Gam) in his employ. And finally, the spirits of the dead mingle with the living as the town comes out to watch a man send his mother and daughter to a mental institution. While Outras Estorias was directed by Pedro Bial, Bial credited Caca Carvalho and Giulia Gam with directing his actors.",
