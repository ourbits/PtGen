    "introduction": "1961. A father and his daughter are trying to meet in Berlin after seventeen years when destiny had separated them. The father is from Soviet Lithuania and the daughter, an émigré living in the United States. Irrespective that there is a “thawing” period in the Soviet Union and the wall has not been built yet in Berlin, the Cold War is approaching its culmination. As soon as father arrives in Berlin, undercover employees of the KGB begin taking care of him. They try to entice the daughter to come to the East. However, the atmosphere of the city seeped with mistrust has affected her, and she is afraid to step across the boundary line of West Berlin. To help each other escape any potential KGB entrapments, both father and daughter are prepared to renounce the meeting they’ve been yearning for so much. . .",
