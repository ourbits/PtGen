    "introduction": "This was the first of the videos that started a trend of sex education videos in the early 1990s . I guess the idea behind it was for liberated women to go into a high street store and buy it without any type of guilt or inhibition , but no doubt the main buyer market was teenage boys and dirty old menTHE LOVERS GUIDE is groundbreaking in the fact that it publicised that the couples involved were real life partners but this is slightly dishonest , yes the main couple featured Wendy and her husband were indeed a real life couple who'd been married several years but there was some public controversy that at least one of the couples Kathryn ( The gorgeous brunette ) and Marino ( The well buffed geezer with a ponytail ) had never met one another until they appeared on set where they had unprotected sex for the camera . For a video that self righteously dedicates segments to safe sex it is rather hypocriticalSeeing as it's for education purposes and not pornography as such there's limits as to what can be shown but as a sex education video it's not uninformative though I doubt if you'll be gasping \" I never knew that \"As a footnote the main couple featured became something of sexual problem agony aunts in the British press - Until it was revealed that Wendy's husband had a serious heart condition which put a stop to sex . I almost felt sorry for this couple who confessed that they used to make love as often as ten times a day but now couldn't make love once a day because it was too dangerous . My small amount of sympathy soon vanished when shortly afterwards the couple split up and raced off to the gutter press in order to dish the dirt on one another to the highest bidder .",
