    "introduction": "The analog film prints in the Arsenal archive are getting new cans—10,000 reels are currently being re-housed. The goal is to improve the storage conditions. But this will change the look of the archive: Instead of all the old cardboard boxes with their stickers and labels bearing witness to decades of film circulation, the new film cans will erase this part of the history before they will become an evidence of time themselves. Before the re-housing began, filmmaker Ute Aurand was invited to visit the vaults with her camera. Through the lens of her Bolex, she made some discoveries.",
