    "introduction": "Frédéric Back's third film was inspired by Amerindian legends about the cycle of the seasons. The beautiful days of summer come to a sudden end as the children flee before Howling Wolf, the terrible wind of the cold. They take shelter in the forest. Howling Wolf strips the trees of their beautiful coloured leaves but is unable to find the children hiding among the evergreens. So he joins forces with White Bear, the snow, to flush them out. Tired of the cold, a little girl implores Glooscap, the great Manitou, to bring back the warm weather. Glooscap orders the Sun to chase Howling Wolf and White Bear away. Then he blows life into the dead leaves, transforming them into colourful songbirds.",
