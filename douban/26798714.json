    "introduction": "Symptoms tells the story of a trainee doctor, Sam, and his final practical examination. Set in the world - known well to most actors - of fake illness and playing a part, not all of the \"patients\" that Sam sees are who they seem. Sam comes into contact with a variety of actors, with a wide range of abilities, from mockney Ben who wants to talk about \"the thing in his pants\" to inept Jenna who can't keep her fake wound stuck on. But then everything changes when he has to diagnose Amy. Hostile and intense, what is she hiding?",
