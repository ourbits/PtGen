    "introduction": "Monsieur Max Linder, the screen idol of Europe, had just recuperated from a dangerous war wound when an agent of Essanay secured his services to produce comedies in America. On the eve of his departure a submarine sinks a big Atlantic liner. He and his friend, Ernest Maupain, who is crossing with him on the steamship Espagne, are frightened. No undersea boat appears, however, and they are calmed. Max persuades the captain of the vessel to make. Maupain believe a U-boat has torpedoed the Espagne; simultaneously Maupain persuades the captain to make Max believe the same thing. That night the sailors douse Maupain with water and shout that the vessel has been torpedoed. He tells them they have made a mistake, and points to Max's cabin. They douse Max. A few moments later a freight steamer rams the Espagne. The passengers rush to the decks in terror. Max and Maupain, however, believe it is their joke. They discover, though, the truth, and both fight for the only remaining life preserver. ... Written by Moving Picture World synopsis",
