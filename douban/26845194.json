    "introduction": "\"Last Chance U\" follows a group of young men training to become the future stars of the NFL. Based at East Mississippi Community College (EMCC), \"Last Chance U\" takes us on a journey to understand the real men of the gridiron at one of the most successful, but least known athletic programs. Each player has incredible talent and drive to be the best, but each face their own unique struggles both on and off the field. As their season takes an unexpected turn, the methods of this unconventional team are deeply called into question. With much to lose, they are constantly reminded of the stakes.",
