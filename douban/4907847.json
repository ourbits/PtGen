    "introduction": "Reeling from her husband's affair, Rose collides with a marooned teenager in a boarded-up Delaware beach town.Devastated by the news of her husband's affair and convulsed by waves of grief and rage, twenty something Rose (Greta Gerwig)-vengeful, a bit unhinged, and still clad in her pajama bottoms-drives to a sleepy seaside town in Delaware intent on finding her spouse's lover. Climbing into an old lighthouse on the beach to swill a six-pack of beer, Rose stumbles upon a sleeping British teenager (Olly Alexander) whom she wakes and insists on taking somewhere. Stranded by some unknown party, the chatty,  ludicrously attired youth accompanies Rose to a brewery where \"the other woman\" was recently employed and then to her parents' summer getaway house, slowly attuning to her anguish. As the grey winter days roll by, the mismatched pair embark on a series of frolicsome adventures-English dance lessons, role-playing in public-that bring them into closer quarters, igniting a bittersweet, perhaps imaginary romance.This quirky romantic comedy follows Rose (Greta Gerwig), whose life changes after discovering her husband s affair. She later crosses paths with a marooned teenager in a boarded-up Delaware beach town and begins a delicate friendship. This engaging and insightful film will make audiences appreciate change for better and worse.",
