    "introduction": "Directed by Giacomo Franciosa, the movie traces the steps of Azzurrina, right where her legend was born, in the Montebello's Castle in Emilia Romagna region. Here she supposedly disappeared in 1375...and her voice reappears periodically to visitors. It all happened on the Summer solstice, June 21st 1375, in the Montebello Castle, in the province of Rimini, Emilia Romagna. Daughter of Ugolinuccio di Montebello, Guendalina was an albino girl. At that time, albinos were considered offspring of the Devil and were burnt at the stake. In order to prevent that, her mother used to dye her hair with a natural black colour that with time would discolour and leave a light blue hue (\"azzurro\", in Italian).",
