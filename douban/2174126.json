    "introduction": "Sex, Drugs & Democracy, a feature-length, documentary film, explores the limits of personal freedom. The film takes an uncensored look at the unconventional approach to morality and politics in Holland.a Jonathan Blank film\"A seductive documentary about Holland, which permits prostitution, abortion, pornography and marijuana use, has banned capital punishment and handguns, and has the lowest prison rate in the world, not to mention low rates of crime, abortion, teen pregnancy and drug deaths. The movie argues that many laws governing personal behavior cause more crime than they prevent.\"--Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun Times\"An eye opener which should be required viewing.\"--Alan Dershowitz, from \"Justice\"\"Blank's intriguing documentary, SEX, DRUGS & DEMOCRACY offers an uncensored tour of the nether parts of the Netherlands...The sources, articulate and well pedigreed, are convincing.\"--Rita Kempley, Washington Post",
