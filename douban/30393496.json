    "introduction": "Alicia and Carla are two young girls who suffer from eating disorders. This is the reason of their friendship and together they will search a way out of their illness.“This is the Wind\" is director Pere Vilà Barceló’s fifth feature film. This is a movie that is part of a unique initiative: It is an educational project aimed at young people aged 15 to 17 with the goal of stimulating the ability to analyse a cinematographic work. At the same time, it serves to create an interest in seeing different cinematographic languages, understanding cinema as an art through which an author creates and externalizes a world of his own. This educational project wants to establish a precedent so that in the future these young people are prepared both as public and creators.In this way, Pere Vilà has worked with more than seventy second-year baccalaureate students to complete a feature film with professional actors and technicians and actors such as Alex Brendemühl, Anna Alarcón, Laia Manzanares and Katrin Vankova. A cinematic experience full of sincerity and purity.",
