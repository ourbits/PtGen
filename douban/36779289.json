Vanity Fair can exclusively reveal that Wynonna Earp, the beloved drama that ended its four-season Syfy run in 2021, will return later this year with a scripted special on Tubi, tentatively titled Wynonna Earp: Vengeance. The 90-minute special was written by the show’s creator and executive producer, Emily Andras.Melanie Scrofano (Wynonna herself), Tim Rozon (Doc Holliday), Dom Provost-Chalkley (Waverly Earp), and Katherine Barrell (Nicole Haught) will all be back, and other familiar faces are likely to return as well. Paolo Barzman, who directed many episodes of the drama, will helm the special, which starts shooting in and around Wynonna Earp’s former Calgary stomping grounds soon and will come out in late 2024.",
