    "introduction": "被称为“虚幻竞技场小子”，“键盘破坏者”，或“愤怒的德国小子”:几乎在世界各地都知道这个视频，一个年轻人在玩电脑时崩溃，破坏了他的键盘。时至今日，许多人仍在聊天时把它当作表情包来分享，而不知道这是一场表演。另外，这个年轻人从来没有上传过视频。无能为力的他不得不无数次地目睹它是如何被分享和扭曲的——它是如何摧毁了他生活的一部分。现在，Norman Kochanowski第一次向ZAPP讲述了他的故事以及病毒式传播的后果。Be it as ‘Unreal Tournament Kid’, ‘KeyboardCrasher’, or ‘Angry German Kid’: Almost everywhere across the world this video of a youth who freaks out whilst playing on the computer and destroys his keyboard is known. Many still share it today as a meme when chatting without knowing that it was staged. Also: the young guy never uploaded the video himself. Powerless, he had to witness how it was shared and distorted countless times – how it destroyed a part of his life. Now, for the first time, Norman Kochanowski speaks with ZAPP about his story and the consequences of virality.",
