    "introduction": "Robbie hasn't been doing anything with his life. The years of floundering have made him increasingly malcontent. He is an aspiring writer and although his barhopping lifestyle has provided him with loads of great material and social situations, he is having trouble getting his first novel going. Robbie's best friend, Ian, takes it upon himself to find Robbie the inspiration he needs by double booking a friend's beach house that is being rented to a threesome girls. After several nights of arguments, Internet booty calls gone wrong, hedonistic debauchery and struggles with their female house mates, Robbie realizes that while he has found his inspiration, still, his biggest aspiration is to outgrow his pals and get a deeper, more meaningful life.",
