Jonas's girlfriend (Becht) is the press spokesperson for Mittendorf. After a business gala, she disappears for a while. When she shows up again, she tells Jonas that Mittendorf has sexually harassed her. Jonas urges her to report Mittendorf, but she hesitates, since there is no evidence and Mittendorf apologised to her. But finally, the situation escalates and Jonas is forced to take action.",
