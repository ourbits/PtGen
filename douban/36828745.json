Friendship, secrets, repressed conflicts and passion are the ingredients of this story of which each one has their own version. How much do we lie or adorn the truth? To what extent is the perception of one similar to that of the other? What implications does saying yes or saying no have in life? Passion has many forms, this trio of friends will explore several of them.",
