    "introduction": "People's associations with flora goes back a long way, taking us back to our own roots as well as to new ways of life and creative potential that reveal themselves as we deal with plants. 'Wild Plants' is a film that follows these clues and takes us to urban gardens in Detroit, to Native American philosopher Milo Yellow Hair in Wounded Knee, to the wild plantations of Zurich's legendary 'Guerilla Gardener' Maurice Maggi, and to the innovative horticulture cooperative 'Les Jardins de Cocagne' in Geneva.",
