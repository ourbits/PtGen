    "introduction": "When Jerome returns to Paris, he's got only one thing on his mind: to see Charlie. Wandering the streets of Montmartre, he reflects on their intense friendship and discovers more than he was expecting. Thanks to a dynamic story structure, the film unwinds as a story of secrets, manipulation and conflicts of interest. Egoist was shot in Paris in the summer of 2013 with a small, international team and a reduced budget, but with great amounts of creativity and perseverance.",
