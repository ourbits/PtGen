    "introduction": "“The Americans invented jazz to make up for death, the star to recover from women. To comfort themselves faced with the night, they invented Broadway. Every evening in downtown New York, an artificial day begins. Its purpose is to advertise the shows, vaunt the products, and the inventors of these adverts would be quite astonished to discover that the most fascinating spectacle, the most precious object, is the street transfigured by their signage. This day has its own inhabitants, its shadows, its mirages, its ceremonies. It also has its own sun…” (Chris Marker)“The first film I’ve seen in which colour is absolutely necessary.” (Orson Welles)",
