CRAZY FOR OPERA is the first film about this unique establishment, a declaration of love for an art form that is so often unjustly characterized as elitist and for the people who so passionately practice that art. The audience witnesses how three opera productions come to life: Richard Wagner's DIE MEISTERSINGER VON NÜRNBERG, Jean-Philippe Rameau's LES INDES GALANTES and Giuseppe Verdi's BALLO IN MASCHERA and is introduced to the Bavarian State Ballet during their work for Ludwig Minkus' LA BAYADÈRE. With: Jonas Kaufmann, Anja Harteros, Kirill Petrenko, Zubin Mehta, Ivor Bolton, Igor Zelensky, Nikolaus Bachler, Sir Peter Jonas.",
