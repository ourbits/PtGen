    "introduction": "Death and dismemberment were the obsessions of brooding artist Richard Streeb, and his macabre paintings created a huge sensation. Until one dark night, life indeed imitated art when someone dressed in black decided to give Richard a brutal, bloody taste of his own medicine. But Richard’s body has vanished and everyone is labeled a suspect, including Richard’s estranged brother, Bill who begins an invesitgation of his own.Winding through a maze of perverts, prostitutes, and psychopaths, Bill soon finds himself face-to-face with the mystery killer and the deranged motive behind the carnage. But the skin-crawling madness doesn’t end there!From director Joseph F. Parda comes this award-winning, critically-acclaimed salute to the Italian giallo film (a savage and stylish sub-genre of films made popular by such horror film icons as Dario Argento and Mario Bava).",
