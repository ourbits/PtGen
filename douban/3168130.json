While working in a dance club two years ago, he met Gina; they fell in love and soon saved enough money to buy a house together.Echo is a sound manipulator. He can mimic or distort sounds, replicate frequencies, and create sonic blasts of devastating proportions. Shortly after becoming a mail carrier, Echo's power begins to manifest. When his fight or flight reflex is activated, his ability to manipulate sound increases greatly.",
