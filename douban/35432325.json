    "introduction": "This brilliantly thoughtful film weaves together conversations with Holocaust survivors who talk about the importance of laughter and the use of humor during the Holocaust as a coping mechanism. Through interviews conducted by Israeli comedian Tal Friedman, we discover that even in the most horrible conditions imaginable, people found strength in humor and laughter. Provocative and deeply heartfelt, You Had to Be There will leave you laughing and appreciating the importance of humor even in the face of events that make you want to cry.",
