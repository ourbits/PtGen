    "introduction": "Chile 1980, under military dictatorship. Three young people meet, become friends, and together uphold the \"Independent Republic.\" This is a utopian concept for a better world conceived by Guillermo, one of the three friends, as a reaction to the savage capitalism imposed by the dictatorship. The other two characters, Fernando and Isabel eventually marry. Al three characters' private lives and ideals begin to shift, and Fernando in particular prospers, spurred on by his \"Enthusiasm.\" The ensuing story is the bulk of the plot. The development and outcome of Fernando's enthusiasm, and the impact of the human being's shifting goals and ideals all lead to the eventual conclusion of this Chilean/Spanish co-production.
