    "introduction": "Over the last five years, an independent record shop has closed in the UK every three days. SOUND IT OUT is a portrait of the very last surviving vinyl record shop in Teesside, North East England, directed by an artist who grew up just three miles away. The film captures a cultural haven in one of the most deprived areas in the UK–a place that is thriving against the odds–and the local community that keeps it alive. A distinctive, funny, and intimate film about people, North England, and the irreplaceable role music plays in our lives.",
