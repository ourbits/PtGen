The quiet Ray wants out of the 'gangsta' life and into the local music scene with his pals, while his brash, emotional partner Terry wants to dominate the city's criminal community. His strange fixation with Ray and his pathological need for respect that he cannot show to others in return, lead him to make some impulsive moves that result in violent death and tragedy for all concerned.",
