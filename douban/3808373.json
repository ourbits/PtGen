    "introduction": "User comment from Imdb:A documentary short filmed in Baltimore and hosted by Edie herself, this features hilarious re-enactments of Edie's life (throwing dirty water on her wicked stepsisters, seducing drinks out of sailors in a bar, her stage show, etc.), cameos by John Waters regulars Mink Stole, Pat Moran, and Ed and Vincent Peranio, an interview with John Waters, Edie interviewed walking down the sleazy streets of Baltimore, and some nice behind-the-scenes dirt from Edie about \"Pink Flamingos\"! This has finally become easier to find on video, so do yourself a favor and spend 15 minutes with the most unique John Waters cast member. You can't help but fall in love with her personality before the show is through!",
