He takes on his responsibilities and enters into a relationship with the beautiful Maria, from whom he does not hide the fact that he is already married. Meanwhile, his wife Anna and Synesios are arrested by the Germans for having leaked information in Cairo about the movements of the German fleet. Komninos, with a team of commandos, disembark in occupied Greece and manage to free their imprisoned compatriots, except for Synesios, who has already been executed. When they are trying to escape, however, Anna is mortally wounded. At the end of the war, Komninos asks Governor Raidis to forgive him for having suspected him of being his wife's lover. With Maria he visits Anna's grave.",
