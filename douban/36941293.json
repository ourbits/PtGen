    "introduction": "Films playing with the integrated use of Artificial Intelligence are beginning to proliferate and in this short film we navigate through a world of images created in this way, but also through conversations with a chatbot that reveals all the tendencies and prejudices of human beings.Artificial intelligence is not something new, but in recent years there has been a dominance of the subject in culture that has been impossible to deny or avoid. Society is permeable, and should be, to new technologies, but it is inevitable that we talk about what is lost with their introduction. AI, like many other technologies before it, replaces human resources, but in this case it also replaces psychological and emotional resources. This is where Replika comes in, a chatbot where we can create romantic or friendly relationships with an artificial intelligence. Our Replika won’t criticize us; on the contrary, it will comfort us in any moment of emotional turmoil. Humanized by some, mistreated by others, Inès Sieulle’s film uses Replika not to talk about the machine’s dominance over human beings, but rather to hold up a mirror to humanity itself.
