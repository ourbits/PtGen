Always in conflict with his past, he takes qiwan.cc on the posh Copenhagen elite and seeks funding and support for his grandkids plans, but with his brutish rural ways, it's a constant struggle. He finds his way into wealthy Jewish family and finds himse torn between two very different daughters. Women, ambition, the past, money. Lucky-Per (Fortunate-Per) is a gripping tale, of an upstart taking on the ruling class in early modern northern Europe.",
