    "introduction": "Sunny O'Sullivan, a circus performer, and Larry Warren, an automotive engineer in a wealthy auto business family, are thrust together during the Mardi Gras celebration in New Orleans. Groups of people blocking both entrances to the courtyard, in which they are trapped, refuse to allow them to escape until they kiss. Eventually the pair are resigned to carrying out the crowd's demand and are surprised by how pleasant it is. The human barriers dissolve and the two go their separate ways into the rowdy crowd. Larry is flabbergasted to see Sunny staring in the circus act of the nightclub his family group are later attending. He manages to catch Sunny's eye, then follows it up with a bouquet of 50 roses and an invitation to dinner. The original plans do not work out, but the two manage to slip away and have a fabulous 10-course dinner on the street from food vendors. They end up on a moonlight riverboat cruise that leads to a proposal from Larry. His family is not pleased to learn that he has committed to marry a girl of such low social status. Her fellow performers are sad to see he go because she has been their star performer. Larry picks her up to take her to the family mansion for the pre-wedding celebrations. She is particularly nervous about being accepted by his high-society relations and friends. She does manage to win the approval of crusty, old Aunt Barbara who gives her some moral support for the upcoming ceremony. Unknown to either one of them, Sunny's circus friends crash the wedding. Larry is outraged and throws a fit. Sunny leaves disappointed that he cannot accept her friends. She returns to performing. Larry has second thoughts and comes after her.",
