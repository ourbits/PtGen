    "introduction": "Follows the dreams of Lana (Lindsay Lohan), a marine biologist who longs to escape her ordinary life with the sea creatures she loves, and of Jordan (Jordan Weller) drowning under the Brooklyn Bridge. Rescued by the mysterious Ondine (Cassie Chegwidden), he dreams with her that she brings him home. Her romance is subverted by his angst, as his ex Lana and his fears drown his new hope foreshadowing tragedy. Meanwhile seals storm Manhattan and are captured, and Lana awakes to find enchanting women in her aquarium, the souls of the drowned, come to save Ondine. Lana releases them, asking them to take her with them, but they tie her up for her own protection. In vintage lingerie and their furs, the Selkies run through the streets to find Ondine with Nick, whom they try to seduce, before celebrating in a night of revelry winning the hearts of all Gotham's bachelors until tragedy ensues.",
