    "introduction": "Italian-born Massimo and Lella Vignelli are among the world's most influential designers. Throughout their long career, their motto has been, 'If you can't find it, design it' The work covers such a broad spectrum that one could say the Vignellis are known by everybody, even those who don't know their names. From graphics to interiors to products and corporate identities, the film brings us into the work and everyday moments of the Vignellis' world, capturing their intelligence and creativity, as well as their humanity, warmth, and humor.",
