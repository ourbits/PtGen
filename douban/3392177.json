    "introduction": "Open from 18 to 24 is a 1988 Argentine drama film directed and written by Víctor Dínenzon. The picture stars Gerardo Romano and Horacio Pena, and others. The film was released on 2 June 1988.From six until midnight, a tango class is led by Carla, who just lost the love of her life, Vincente. The mostly middle-aged, middle-class students attend the class for a variety of reasons, but for the most part they enjoy the sensual romanticism of the tango's dance movements and music.When Vincente's handsome nephew shows up from the countryside, passions grow more heated, and closeted jealousies and rivalries of the students become unscaled. At the film's end, the leader Carla reveals a surprising fact about herself.",
