Twists and turns in both of the characters' lives allows for them to encounter adversaries that test their friendship, their strength, and the power to go on. We see how they are individually affected as a result of their poverty, drug, and crime stricken backgrounds which will give them the option to either become a product of their environments or products of themselves.",
