    "introduction": "Mumbai, 2008. On the night of November 26, Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorists attacked targets throughout the city, including the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, one of the world's most exclusive luxury hotels. For sixty-eight hours, hundreds were held hostage as shots rang out and an enormous fire raged. When the smoke cleared, thirty-one people were dead and many more had been injured. Only the courageous actions of staff and guests-including Mallika Jagad, Bob Nichols, and Taj general manager Binny Kang-prevented a much higher death toll. With a deep understanding of the region and its politics and a narrative flair reminiscent of Midnight in Peking from the journalists Cathy Scott-Clark and Adrian Levy, the film vividly unfold the tragic events as a real-life thriller filled with suspense, tragedy, history, and heroism.",
