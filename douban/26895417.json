    "introduction": "They are childhood friends who have talked about absolutely everything. When director Annekatrin Hendel invites her good friend Ines Rastig to four weeks in a luxury hotel, they bring along a camera, meant to serve as a buffer, but which ends up destroying any chance of pretense. The beautiful Baltic beach is covered in snow, and inside, in the room, the women carry on conversations that are as intimate, pained, angry, and funny as they can get. Ines, the East Berlin anarchist artist turned housewife and mother, is rediscovering herself after the painful divorce that made her homeless. In between memories, a scary disease, and a weird internet romance, Ines turns out never to have lost her artist’s point of view, which gives the film its outstanding visual qualities.",
