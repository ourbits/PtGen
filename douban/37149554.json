    "introduction": "蔡明亮拍攝的宜蘭紀錄片，片長60分鐘。他說：「聲遠與他的田中央工作團隊受邀參加2021年威尼斯建築雙年展，在軍火庫主展場展出概念作品《大家牽做伙》。他們希望展場同時放映我的影像作品，作為對他們建築的一種呼應。我選擇拍攝宜蘭的南館市場、城隍廟的早餐店、復興路的燒餅店、宜蘭的山水和稻田，我認為這些都是建築師的日常。田中央可貴之處絕非閉門造車，他們的作品深受宜蘭的地貌和風土人情牽引著，並回應於藝術家的熱情與愛。」Produced in collaboration with Fieldoffice Architects – an acclaimed architecture firm based in Taiwan’s Yilan County – this work was created (alongside Strolling Around) for the 2021 Venice Architecture Biennale before being re-edited into its current form for the 2023 exhibition ‘Beyond Architecture -- Fieldoffice Architects ＋ 7 Artists’ at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Taipei.Inspired by Fieldoffice’s embrace of the local customs and community of Yilan, Tsai films the quotidian rituals of the local eating spots frequented by the firm’s architects, along with the gentle rhythms of the surrounding mountains, paddies and bodies of water.",
