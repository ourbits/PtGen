    "introduction": "已八十岁高龄的著名波兰演员杰西·诺瓦卡决定在其死后将尸体用于科学研究。本片就记录了他做决定的整个过程，包括其中遇到的困境和对于死亡的看法。在波兰这样的天主教国家，这部影片因其主题将会在社会引起广泛争论。杰西已处于绝症晚期，并希望在一个即死之人的角度讲述这个故事；而作为演员，他想以此作为他最后一个角色，同时也是演艺生涯中第一个主角，去讲述他为什么做出这个决定。影片内容发人深省，具有很强的可探讨性，传达一个具有讽刺意味又带有正能量的主题。本片将这个主题以一种新的方式展现在观众面前。\tA famous Polish actor, 80-years old Jerzy Nowak (eg \"Schindler's List\" dir. S. Spielberg and Andrzej Wajda movies) decided that after death his body should not be buried, but used for the benefit of science. The documentary shows the process of making that decision, the actor's dilemmas and important thoughts about death. In catholic countries – like Poland – the documentary will be controversial if only for its subject matter. Polish actor is terminally ill and wants to tell the story from the perspective of a dying man. As an actor he wants to play his last role, at the same time the first leading one, and explain why he decided to donate his body to science. Personal, ironic, and often positive themes in the context of a fundamental, thought-provoking, taboo raising discussion. The film treats its subject in a way which is innovative even on the world scale.",
