    "introduction": "In the Swabian villages of Ober- and Unterrieslingen, once again peace has been disturbed; because of every scrap, the old opposition breaks out again. Various love affairs between the Häberle and Rossbauer families, some Oberrieslingers and others Unterrieslingers, are also affected. It's getting serious: The church roof has crashed over Pastor Schäuble. And the thirsty shepherd has long since drunk the money that was collected for church repairs. A loan from the bank is not included. The hard-working villagers see their chance in a competition for chapels in Hamburg. That fits, even if the band doesn't mean your little church, but a band. Should the Rieslingers win the competition, they would be rid of their worries. But to do this, the rock band from Unterrieslingen and the brass band from Oberrieslingen must team up. In fact, after one or the other discord, they manage to get on the northbound bus together.",
