After being turned down her last script and assigned an unwanted side job in her home town by an executive, she seriously considers quitting all. To make things worse, her mother gets sick. She got stuck in an unwanted circumstance. But strange enough, the unwanted side job gives her a glimpse of hope. The project is about the last Kie-sang (the feudal age courtesan) San-ok, who was the most excellent artist. Somehow Yeon-ju feels connected with her. At the verge of giving up her dream and life altogether, Yeon-ju starts to write a new script with the help of San-ok in her fantasy.",
