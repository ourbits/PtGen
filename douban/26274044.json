The series centers around four twenty-something Mohawk women trying to find their place in the world. And, of course, trying to find love. But in a small world where you or your friends have dated everyone on the rez, or the hot new guy turns out to be your cousin, it ain't that simple. Torn between family pressure, tradition, obligation and the intoxicating freedom of the \"outside world,\" this fabulous foursome is on a mission to find happiness... and to find themselves.",
