    "introduction": "It's a kind of whirlwind of vital, active illusion. Necessary illusion or not, depending if man masters it or succumbs to it. The film does not take a position for or against illusion, it contents itself with depicting its filmic appearances. Illusion which, in the film, raises up the content and the form. I try to give to the film its true communicative value straight-on, beyond partial criteria. It's a kind of super-production (everyone can understand) for the dead (it is a film and not a narrative, a story, a documentary, etc... all these literary categories cannot fit raw material: 20th-century cinema which communicates with the depths of man, as far as it is possible to reach it, of course: this pertains to death). As I close the parentheses, I continue: my research has taken me to the holy and occult books of the Occident and the Orient: I Ching, Barde Thödol, Tao To King etc...; but also to Mao Tse Tung or magazines or comic books etc...: I face all that stands in my way, advancing not through time but through space. I speak of this because this is the basis of my films, the personal space as it is impersonal for the man who doesn't seek to project himself into the overflowing world, but instead to receive what is given to him by this overflow.源自：https://lightcone.org/en/film-7316-chromo-sud",
