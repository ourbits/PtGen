    "introduction": "In February 2022, Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. A month later, filmmaker Akane Yamada traveled there to document the lives of animals—those often forgotten in war. In a shelter near Kyiv, she learned of “The Tragedy of Borodianka,” where 222 dogs reportedly died. Determined to uncover the truth, she kept returning for the next three years. Amid devastation, she found not only animals struggling to survive, but also people risking everything to protect them.",
