    "introduction": "Ed (Edward Hogg) is at a crossroads in his life. In his early thirties, his unrewarding job in a call centre is getting more and more frustrating, while his career as a stand-up is not taking off in the way he hoped it would; in fact, he's starting to acknowledge he might not be a very good comedian. His love life begins to look promising when he meets artist Nathan (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett), a gorgeous younger man who quickly develops a deep affection for Ed. Yet Ed's feelings are conflicted when he recognises he is drawn to his female flatmate Elisa (Elisa Lasowski).",
