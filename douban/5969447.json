Global mega star 'Robbie Williams' rejoins his former band mates for the first time in over 15 years to record Take That's sixth studio album 'Progress'. 'Look Back, Don't Stare' gives a brutally honest account of how Williams return to the group has affected the other four members and shows how the pressures of fame and the relentless power struggle for artistic leadership between Williams and Barlow contributed to the break up of one of the best selling bands of the 90's.",
