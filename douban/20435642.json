    "introduction": "摘自AMAZON評論：The point of this movie is to showcase bad movies, as it says on the back cover, and it's pretty spot on. A lot of the movies clips shown are bad. It's the good, the bad and the ugly of the worst movies ever made. It also highlight's some of the first movies made by beloved actors such as Jamie Lee Curtis, David Carradine and James Keach. It's also nice to see a baby Steve Buscemi and Mark Boone Jr as the hosts of this delectable film treat.Contents include:Living Venus (1960)Daughter of the Sun (1962)Blood Feast (1963)Sex and the College Girl (1964)Two Thousand Maniacs!Bad Girls Do Cry (1965)Color Me Blood Red (1965)Something Weird (1967)The Gruesome Twosome (1967)The Psychic (1968)Just for the Hell of It (1968)She-Devils on Wheels (1968)The Wizard of Gore (1970)Dracula Vs.
