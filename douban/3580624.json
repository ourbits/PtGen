    "introduction": "四十分钟的纪录片短片《走进约翰·凯泽尔》（I Knew It Was You：Rediscovering John Cazale）于4月26日下午在美国马萨诸塞州萨默维尔市影院放映。约翰·凯泽尔是意裔美国人，他的一生中只塑造过五个角色，但个个都被影迷们奉为经典。在他出演电影之前，已经凭舞台剧《印第安人想要布朗克斯》(TheIndianWantstheBronx)赢得多项大奖。凯泽尔与阿尔·帕西诺是老朋友，所以在阿尔有机会出演弗朗西斯·福特·科波拉的《教父》时，凯泽尔也受邀出演片中的弗雷多。在《教父II》中他继续扮演了这个人物，并成为他个人表演生涯中的一个最为知名的角色。1974年凯泽尔同吉恩·哈克曼及哈里森·福特合作了惊悚片《窃听大阴谋》，在片中他扮演哈克曼的助手斯坦。此片也是科波拉执导的。凯泽尔的第四个角色是在影片《热天午后》中的银行劫匪萨尔，此片为他赢得了当年金球奖最佳男配角的提名。凯泽尔的最后一部电影《猎鹿人》是与梅丽尔·斯特里普合作的，影片拍摄时凯泽尔已经身患癌症。在拍摄过程中他与斯特里普相互吸引并订婚。导演迈克尔·西米诺在得知凯泽尔的病情之后，决定把凯泽尔的戏分先拍完。后来剧组发现他得了骨癌，想让他退出剧组时，斯特里普表示如果凯泽尔退出，她也将辞演。影片拍摄完成后不久凯泽尔即与世长辞。约翰·凯泽尔参演作品列表：《猎鹿人》(The Deer Hunter)(1978)《热天午后》(Dog Day Afternoon)(1975)《窃听大阴谋》(The Conversation)(1974)《教父2》(The Godfather：PartII)(1974)《教父》(The Godfather)(1972)制作人动机：很多影迷对《教父》电影中的明星都已耳熟能详，然而提到扮演弗雷多的演员时，人们脑海中常常一片空白。这部纪录片则详细介绍了这位英年早逝的意大利裔明星：约翰·凯泽尔。Admired by actors and directors, adored by friends and lovers, yet unknown to most movie-goers, the venerable stage and screen actor John Cazale appeared in some of the most iconic films of the 1970's - Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, The Godfather: Part II and The Conversation, Sidney Lumet's Dog Day Afternoon and Michael Cimino's The Deer Hunter. The critically-lauded films collectively earned 40 Oscar nominations, including 14 for Cazale's co-stars, and raked in millions at the box office.In 1978, just after wrapping The Deer Hunter, Cazale died tragically at age 42 and cinema was robbed of one its brightest. In I Knew It Was You, director Richard Shepard talks with Cazale's co-stars and friends, Al Pacino, Meryl Streep, Robert DeNiro, Francis Ford Coppola, Israel Horovitz, Phillip Seymor Hoffman, Steve Buscemi and Sam Rockwell, and paints a loving tribute to a talent taken too soon.John Cazale's resume as a film actor isn't long, but it's distinguished. Cazale appeared in five feature films, and each one received an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture, while three of them -- The Godfather, The Godfather Part II and The Deer Hunter -- won the category. Al Pacino, who made three films with Cazale, considered him one his finest acting partners, and many film buffs cite Cazale as one of the best actors of his generation. But Cazale was thirty-seven years old before making his film debut after distinguishing himself in the New York theater community, and shortly after completing work on The Deer Hunter, cancer claimed his life in the spring of 1978. I Knew It Was You: Rediscovering John Cazale is a short documentary celebrating the life and art of Cazale, featuring clips from his memorable performances and interviews with friends, colleagues and fans, including Meryl Streep (who was also Cazale's wife), Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Gene Hackman, Francis Ford Coppola, Sidney Lumet, SteveBuscemi, Philip Seymour Hoffman and many others. I Knew It Was You was an official selection at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival.",
