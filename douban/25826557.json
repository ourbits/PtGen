    "introduction": "The series is a cross between a romantic comedy and a crime (con) series. It tells the story of Anna, a 40 year old woman who just ended a relationship back in Israel, and is traveling in India with two younger Israeli Arabs, Amir and Omar, whom she just met in India. The charming Amir and Omar, who seem eager for her to join them in their travels, eventually make a sort of sting operation on her, and disappear with her money. What makes it even worse, is the fact that Anna fell in love with one of them.",
