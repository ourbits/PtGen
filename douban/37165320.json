    "introduction": "Technology is a form of tool making (body extension). Technology is not art—not invention. It is a simultaneous hope and hoax. It does not concern itself with the undefined, the inexplicable: it deals with the affirmation of its own making. Technology is what we do to the Black Panthers and the Vietnamese under the guise of advancement in a materialistic theology.—Richard SerraHands Tied, rather than being a task, is the performance of a feat, which lasts as long as it takes Serra, whose hands are tied with rope inside the frame, to untie the knots. The film sets up a dialectic between hands and material as the hands move and strain in loosening the rope. As in Hand Catching Lead (1968) and Hands Scraping (1968), the hands become the performers and acquire a physical expressiveness of their own.",
