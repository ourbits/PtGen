    "introduction": "Sergeant Mark Quinn is a policeman who is known among his superiors as extremely persistent, unrestrained and merciless against criminals. The reason for this is to be found in his past. When he was a child he was the only one who has escaped a family massacre, and the murderers of his parents were never catched. In the meantime he was raised by a Japanese and teached in the arts of the Ninja. The tough, longstanding training pays off when he meets the killer of his father again… With all weapons and the precise and deadly techniques of the Ninja he takes revenge…",
