    "introduction": "Time is almost up for Perro, a former member of a paramilitary group turned hitman: the amnesty law passed by the government in 1995 protecting the military for committing crimes against humanity is about to be repealed. An assignment leads him to the “Soldiers of Christ” church where he is welcomed with open arms by its charismatic preacher and by Milagros, a troubled young woman. Caravedo’s and Higashionna’s debut is at once a tough and gritty crime thriller and a character study of a man unwilling to renounce his darkest instincts.",
