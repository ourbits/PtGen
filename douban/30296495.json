    "introduction": "Herbert Kilpin was the founder of AC Milan FC, one of the world's biggest football clubs. He emigrated from his hometown of Nottingham, UK, in the late nineteenth century to move to Italy to work in the textiles industry. From there he created a football club that some of the world's best footballers have played for, such as; Paulo Maldini, Gianni Rivera, Ruud Gullit, Kaka, Marco Van Basten, George Weah and David Beckham. The club was recently sold for $720million, but he created it just for fun. For many years Herbert's story was forgotten and remained untold. This film uncovers new information about the founder of AC Milan and the men who helped bring his memory back to life.",
