    "introduction": "Philippe Vallois has been directing fiction and documentary films in France since 1974. In Brazil, a few years ago, the handsome Bruno Hilario discovered Vallois' film Johan during his film studies , and fell in love with it. Now director of the Belo Horizonte film library, he worked like the devil to finance Philippe's visit to Brazil with seven of his films. The director not only travels there with his camera, but also takes advantage of the experience to look back on his work, which is often linked to his love affairs and trials.",
