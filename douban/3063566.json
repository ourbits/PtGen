    "introduction": "The concept of this 24 min video is based on the reminiscenses of a hotel - or some rooms of the hotel. Leonard Cohen plays a (long term) resident of the hotel. Each song is depicted by a little visual story involving some of the guests. There are no words other than those in the songs. \"Memories\" is set to a dance (like a prom) with Cohen up on stage leading the band. The two dancers that are featured in this vignette are very good (the bellboy and a hotel maid in the film). Choreography by Ann Ditchburn.Written by Leonard Cohen and Mark Shekter, produced by Allan Nichols for Blue Memorial Video Ltd (the chairman of the company and one of the owners is Cohen). Filmed at the King Edward Hotel, Toronto.The video won the Golden Rose international television award in Montreux, Switzerland.The home video was released in 1996 in Canada.",
