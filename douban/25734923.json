    "introduction": "American Vagabond is a cinematic feature documentary about gay youth living without a home in the shadows of a promised city. It's a story about a modern Western society in which homosexuality is still so demonized in some communities that some parents are ready to abandon their children over it. One out of every four young people who are coming out to their parents is kicked out of the house. 20 to 40 percent of homeless youth are estimated to belong to sexual minorities in the United States.",
