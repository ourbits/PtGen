    "introduction": "Terry and Julian is a British sitcom that aired on Channel 4 in 1992. Starring Julian Clary, it was written by Clary, Paul Merton and John Henderson. The title is a spoof the title of the long-running BBC sitcom Terry and June, whose star June Whitfield made a guest appearance in one episode of Terry and Julian.Terry, an average, heterosexual man, advertises for a lodger for his flat in Streatham and Julian, a flamboyant gay Channel 4 celebrity moves in. Julian soon disrupts Terry's mundane life, turns the flat into something similar to a 18th century Turkish boudoir and disrupts Terry's relationship with his girlfriend, policewoman Rene.Unusually for a sitcom, Terry and Julian breaks the \"fourth wall\" by recognising the studio audience and viewers, and employs use of audience participation.",
