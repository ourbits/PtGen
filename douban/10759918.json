    "introduction": "The flood of refugees at the conclusion of World War II grew to near Biblical proportions. Europe was a shattered continent from east to west. Ukraine bore the brunt of the destruction: its people displaced, divided, and forced to flee their native land.Thousands of Ukrainians, ‘Ostarbeiters’ (Eastern workers), once-interned soldiers awaiting to learn their fate, forced out by the war, find themselves in occupied Germany’s western Allied sector. Into their midst arrive soldiers of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army who battled their way to the Western sector, joining the sea of Ukrainians in the displaced persons camps of Western Europe.In is in the midst of this historical upheaval that the drama of Assassination unfolds. Having survived the hardships of both the war and the liberation struggle, the main characters find themselves in the free world, but still under threat: the displaced persons camps of World War II have become yet another arena for the political battle waged by the Soviet NKVD in an effort to take possession of people’s destinies.",
