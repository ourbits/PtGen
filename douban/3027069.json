    "introduction": "Night over China An extraordinary document from one of the Cold War's bitterest conflicts - between the Soviet Union and Communist China - this film spares no quarter in its indictment of Maoist evils and misrule. Includes many remarkable sequences, drawn from Chinese, Polish, and Western as well as Soviet sources, illustrating the grandeur and folly of China's fallen Revolution. Notable scenes depict the early upheavals of rural land reform, the backyard steel furnace campaign of the Great Leap Forward; and the Cultural Revolution (including Mao's celebrated swim in the Yangtze River, surrounded by swimming phalanxes of banner-waving Red Guards).Alexander Medvedkin, Soviet Union, 1971, 59 min",
