    "introduction": "Rodrigo and Samuel are brothers, separated by a handful of years and by their characters. As much as the former (and elder) is aggressive, the latter is calm and more reflective. When their mother—who has always been mentally unstable—disappears, leaving behind nothing but a mysterious note in which she says goodbye, they set out on a journey that will take them across Mexico to the Sonoran Desert, a terrible place and the epitome of the rite of initiation. In fact Rodrigo and Samuel’s quest will also be an intense and painful overcoming of the shadow line, in the course of which the brothers’ different natures will eventually acknowledge one another and clash in the eternal struggle that promises salvation at the cost of cutting ties with the people you love.",
