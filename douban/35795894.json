    "introduction": "The former front man of the once-loved rock band Zhiguli, Fory, cannot pay the tuition fees for his talented daughter at the Royal Academy of Music in London. A wealthy, loyal fan of Fory offers him a hefty paycheck, if his favourite band from his youth Zhiguli plays at his 50th anniversary. This offer fully motivates Fory to bring back the band that fell apart 30 years ago. He discovers that none of the members live their dreamy lives. They have slowly turned into „a practical rebel – if you don’t benefit from it, don’t get into a fight”. During they rehearse, they dive into clarifying old love tensions and conflicts, and create new funny blunders.",
