    "introduction": "A documentary about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that have lasted for more than 50 years. Contains some interviews with the children in this conflictIn a series of extraordinary interviews with both Palestinians and Israelis, John Pilger weaves together the issue of Palestine. He speaks to the families of suicide bombers and their victims; he sees the humiliation of Palestinians imposed on them at myriad checkpoints and with a permit system not dissimilar to apartheid South Africa's infamous pass laws. He goes into the refugee camps and meets children who, he says, \"no longer dream like other children, or if they do, it is about death.\"",
