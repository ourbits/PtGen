    "introduction": "The Laxá Farmers is about old farmers who 40 years ago blew up a dam to save their valley. They had protested for years but were losing the battle and being chased off their land when in the middle of the night they brought out the dynamite. This event marks the birth of environmentalism in Iceland. The farmers won a court case against them by sticking together and all confessing. For 40 years they have never revealed the secret. Until now.",
