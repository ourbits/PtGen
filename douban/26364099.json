She was flown to the American Hospital in Paris where she was to die a few days later. What nobody could have imagined beforehand was that the San Sebastian Film Festival would turn out to be the final performance of one the great stars from Hollywood's golden era. 'When Bette Davis bid farewell' bring together eyewitness accounts from journalists, photographers and members of the organization who worked in the San Sebastian Film Festival that year. The film features a special contribution from Kathryn Sermak, the personal assistant who accompanied the actress on the visit and on whom the actress relied in the final stages of her life.",
