    "introduction": "The middle-aged detective, Fukama, has vicious habit of lashing out violently without regard for the consequences of his actions once he was enraged. He was once praised for his meritorious efforts to put his vices to good use and wipe out the gangs from the city. Yet, Fukama is blamed for deaths in the grand stand, and is sent to a medical facility overseas for treatment. A few years later, when Fukama returns to Japan halfway through his treatment, he realizes that the atmosphere of the city has changed completely. The obscene store he frequented is gone, and there is no sign of the drinking buddies he had been close to or the delinquents he had been taking care of. Moreover, the neighborhood watch group has been conducting a series of high-pressure \"patrols\". What is happening to this city? A long-forgotten flame of anger begins to flicker in Fukama’s mind.",
