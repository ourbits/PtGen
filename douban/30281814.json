    "introduction": "As the twentieth century approaches, Audrey Byrne and her family are returning to their cattle ranch, following a deal that will embrace the industrial revolution, and divide their town. They find themselves in the cross-hairs of a rival cattle rancher, and townsfolk, that aren't willing to give up their way of life in the name of progress. Not long after the loss of her husband, Audrey is challenged with the safety of her two children, while hoping to salvage her land deal that will secure their future. Audrey's fate falls to Beau Hannigan, the son of a fellow rancher, who dares to stand between her and the rival ranchers, intent on stopping her at all costs.",
