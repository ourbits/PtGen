    "introduction": "SYNOPSISWhen Christian Taylor, a writer on HBO’s wildly popular Six Feet Under, agrees to let a British Television crew follow him for a series about Brits working in Hollywood, he finds that his true calling may be in the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas’ Stage and not in the harsh world of Hollywood show business.Lindy Heymann and her documentary crew first meet Christian while Six Feet Under is shooting on location in Las Vegas.  Christian is an intelligent and young writer/producer who is part of the creative team behind the series.Unbeknownst to Christian, who is miked, Lindy and her camera crew are able to listen in when Executive Producer Alan Ball calls Christian into his trailer.  Ball tells Christian that his contract will not be renewed for the following season.  With an explanation that is succinct and cold, Ball suggests that Christian may be better suited to a hospital or legal drama.In a state of shock and denial, Christian disappears from the set and from the reality which Lindy and her crew have been documenting.  After flying back to Los Angeles to track Christian down, the British crew discover that Christian has chosen to stay in Las Vegas and is renting a room in the suburbs from veteran Showboy Erich Miller.Unaware that his firing has been recorded, Christian decides to fulfill his obligation to the documentary piece.  He tells the crew that he is remaining in Las Vegas over the summer to research an “action film” that he is writing.  Rather than call Christian on his lie, Lindy convinces Christian that the research Christian is “performing” has a lot more to do with his own personal issues and dreams than any film script.From strip-mall dance studios to the stages of Vegas’ top shows, from Siegfried & Roy to Whoopi Goldberg, Lindy's crew observes Christian’s bizarrely erratic passion-fueled journey to become a Showboy.  On the way, he encounters a cast of wild and wonderful characters who are the true life and soul of Vegas.At times, we wonder if Christian is having a nervous breakdown.  Is fulfilling our dreams always possible?  What life crisis would force us to confront the reality of changing our lives?克里斯基作为编剧创作的《六英尺之下》大获成功后，他的老板没有任何理由下竟然把他给解雇了……带着伤痛与不满，带着执着与自信，他从洛杉矶飞到拉斯维佳斯，在那里重新开始剧本研究工作。另一方面，无意中，女导演林达偷听到克里斯基被炒鱿鱼后，千方百计找到克里斯基，说明来意……克里斯基听后非常感动，于是他们在拉斯维佳斯共同相处6个月……米兰电影节最佳摄影，英国中立电影节最佳导演新人奖洛杉矶电影节参展影片，纽约电影节参展影片，Aspen电影节参展影片",
