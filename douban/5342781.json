    "introduction": "The final film by filmmaker Marlon Riggs jumps into the middle of explosive debates over Black identity. BLACK IS... BLACK AIN'T is a fi lm every African American should see, ponder and discuss. White Americans have always stereotyped African Americans. But the rigid definitions of \"Blackness\" that African Americans impose on each other, Riggs claims, have also been devastating. Is there an essential Black identity? Is there a litmus test defining the real Black man and true Black woman? Riggs uses his grandmother's gumbo as a metaphor for the rich diversity of Black identities. His camera traverses the country, bringing us face to face with Black folks young and old, rich and poor, rural and urban, gay and straight, grappling with the paradox of numerous, often contested definitions of \"Blackness.\" Riggs mixes performances by choreographer Bill T. Jones and poet Essex Hemphill with commentary by noted cultural critics Angela Davis, bell hooks, Cornel West, Michele Wallace, Barbara Smith and Maulana Karenga to create a flavorful stew of personal testimony, music, and history.",
