    "introduction": "This film focuses on Northern wildlife and its close and tragic relation to climate change, which affects all of the Arctic's fragile ecosystems. The example of the polar bear, studied by biologists for the past 20 years, is revealing. Scientists are also concerned about the precarious situation of bowhead whales and belugas, not to mention seals, walruses and many species of birds. Are the lords of the Arctic in danger of ending their reign over their kingdom of ice and snow?Following the six seasons of the Inuit culture, Caroline Underwood proposes an in-depth exploration of the world of Arctic wildlife by presenting animals as the first victims of a system in flux. A wildlife specialist, Caroline uses a global approach in treating her subjects. Her films have always been recognized for their originality and have received numerous honours on the international scene.",
