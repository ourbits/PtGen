    "introduction": "A great live show from Morrissey, not only is the concert on his home turf, it's also on his birthday. Morrissey displays all of the charm and wit that have fueled his popularity. Watch as he alternately taunts and encourages the fans who try to climb on-stage. Songs featured: First Of The Gang To Die Hairdresser On Fire Irish Blood, English Heart The Headmaster Ritual Everyday Is Like Sunday I Have Forgiven Jesus I Know It's Gonna Happen Someday How Can Anybody Possibly Know How I Feel? Rubber Ring Such A Little Thing Makes Such A Big Difference Don't Make Fun Of Daddy's Voice The World Is Full Of Crashing Bores Let Me Kiss You No One Can Hold A Candle To You Jack The Ripper A Rush And A Push And The Land Is Ours I'm Not Sorry Shoplifters Of The World Unite There Is A Light That Never Goes Out Absolutely worth the price of admission.",
