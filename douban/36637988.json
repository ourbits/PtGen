    "introduction": "The legend tells that Sisyphus was condemned by Zeus to live in the underworld for deceiving death and the gods. His punishment was to push a huge stone up a mountain over and over again. Every time he reached the top, the rock would roll back down in an endless loop. Again and again. Hades, the king of the underworld, sent his dog, Cerberus, to guard Sisyphus and prevent him from escaping. Cerberus would ensure his eternal sentence. This short film provides a science fiction perspective on this myth.源自：https://zinebi.eus/en/listings/sisifo/",
