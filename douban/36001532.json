    "introduction": "a serial adaptation of the eponymous comic book by screenwriter Camille Rebetez and artist Pitch Comment. Les Indociles offers a snapshot of the lives (spanning thirty years, from 1973 to 2003) of Lulu (the son of labourers), Joe (whose father heads up a factory) and Chiara (the daughter of Italian immigrants). These three characters - utopians who dream of a fairer and more inclusive society - decide to create a commune called La Ferme des Indociles [The Farm of the Unruly]. Les Indociles allows us to dream of revolution through the eyes of its three protagonists, a big family who contend with the historical and societal ups and downs of a constantly changing Switzerland. La Ferme des Indociles also founds a visionary recovery community for drug addicts. Lulu, Joe and Chiara encourage us to think about what we want to become and about a future which depends primarily on individual choices.",
