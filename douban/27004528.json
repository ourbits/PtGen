    "introduction": "The 2008 News and Documentary Emmy Award winner for Outstanding Investigative Journalism in Long-Form, \"Have You Seen Andy?\" is a personal story of a childhood friendship abruptly ended by the tragic abduction of a young boy, Andy Puglisi. With special access and a unique perspective, Melanie Perkins, Andy's childhood friend, re-examines the day of his disappearance 30 years ago, reviews the police investigation and uncovers new and startling information, prompting the long-\"cold\" case to be reactivated. Through interviews with other kids from the neighborhood, Andy's family, local and state police officers and new forensic experts, Perkins begins to put the pieces of the puzzle together, ultimately focusing in on the suspects in the case, who were never charged at the time.",
