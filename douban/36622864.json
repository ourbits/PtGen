    "introduction": "Beatriz (Glória Pires) is a wealthy woman who seems to have everything she needs, but follows a path without rules and a relentless hunger for power. Inês (Adriana Esteves), with a character just as questionable as Beatriz, cultivates a mixture of envy and fascination for the former friend since her adolescence. Her hatred and lust for revenge are motivated by the certainty that her rival is guilty of her father's death, with whom Beatriz had an affair in the past. On the other hand, the humble and dreamer Regina (Camila Pitanga) is the heroine of the plot. She struggles to achieve her goals, such as finding out who murdered her father, without resorting to sabotaging anyone's plans.",
