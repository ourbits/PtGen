    "introduction": "Going Tribal documents the adventures of former Royal Marine and expedition leader Bruce Parry as he travels the worlds most remote locations and experiences first-hand the cultures that live there. To best document the lives of these peoples, Parry lives with them for up to a month; sleeping, eating, hunting, and joining them in religious and social ceremonies. Although accompanied by a translator, Parry tries to integrate as much as possible with the culture of the people he is observing, often being adopted as a member of a particular family.",
