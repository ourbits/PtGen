    "introduction": "Ana, a young Spanish woman who has just been dumped by her boyfriend, and Tono (her brother) receive some surprising news: their father (Pepe) is getting married to a woman he has met online. They both decide to jet off to Mexico to attend the wedding, but they get more than they bargained for once they get there. Not only is Rous, the bride, younger than they are, but her extensive Mexican family – from a working-class neighbourhood and as rowdy as you can get, headed by the mother, Lupe – has also prepared a welcome they will never forget. Especially Ana, who will meet Horacio, the bride’s irresistible brother, who has the ability to make her extremely anxious. Both families will have to overcome their prejudice and shake off the culture shock in order to discover that love can be found in our differences.",
