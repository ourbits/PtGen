    "introduction": "Lorre and Gayle were heartbroken when they learned their two great-aunts - sisters who'd lived together their entire 80+ years - were on the verge of losing their 1850's home because it was too big a burden to care for anymore. \"Having to leave your home just because you're older?\" Lorre asks. \"After living there 60 years?\" Gayle adds. \"Unfair,\" they agree. So they did something about it. Lorre and Gayle broke their apartment rental lease and moved in with a very grateful Gertrude and Germaine, to be financial, emotional and physical caregivers for their elderly aunts. \"We were the Golden Girls for a while there, and we still call ourselves that, even though we lost Auntie Gert last year,\" Lorre adds. \"But Auntie Germaine is still feisty and we do for her because that's what we've both been taught. You take care of family.\" With that, the first few moments of THE GAY MARRIAGE THING paint a picture of what it means to be a family.",
