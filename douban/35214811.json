    "introduction": "Based on the 1979 comics and movie MANG KEPWENG played by the legendary Chiquito, MANG KEPWENG RETURNS tells the story of the albularyo's son and his adventures with the magical bandana. When Mang Kepweng died because of mysterious circumstances, he buried with him a secret--aside from his son Zacharias (James Blanco), he had another son named Kiefer (Vhong Navarro.) Kiefer is the heir to the magical bandana that possesses the power to heal any kind of illness. Because of this, Mang Kepweng's old nemesis, Ingkong Kapiz (Pen Medina) came back to spread darkness and destroy Kiefer. With the help of his mother, Aling Milagros (Jaclyn Jose) and the magical powers of Princess Alisandra (Jackie Rice), Kiefer will use his newfound powers to save the world against evil as the new Mang Kepweng.—akosijesu",
