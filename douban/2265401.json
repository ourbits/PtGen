    "introduction": "Animated by Vladimir Tarasov (director of “Shooting Range” from Part 1 of this series, and “Forward March, Time! from Part 4).  Boy scouts build a miniature of the battleship Aurora, which according to Bolshevik history fired the first shot of the Revolution.  The ship sails around the world in the name of “Soviet Friendship,” only to be pursued by evil Capitalist sharks.Vladimir  Tarasov  (director/artist):    I  was  a  young artist  when  I  got  a  work proposal  from  a  very  interesting  man  and  director/artist:  Vitold Bordzilovsky.  He suggested I work on this film.  It would have been a sin to miss  the  opportunity.    It  was  very  interesting  work.I  was  just  out  of  the Soviet army and naturally I had the appropriate approach, having been there for three years.  I was against imperialism, and for our little boat and films for our children.",
