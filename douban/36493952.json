Pedro, shy and insecure, is facing his first true love in the midst of his own discoveries. He is taken to the carnival party by his cousin, Joaquim. There, Pedro and Joaquim know Carolina and the love triangle is born. They live the classical triad of Pierrot, Harlequin and Colombina. In the '70s, during the military dictatorship in Brasil, Márcia is a young woman who doesn't want any kind of involvement with politics. However, she is dating Aurélio, but doesn't know that he is a left-wing militant and who also is part of the gunfight against the dictatorship. In 1956 Celeste lives a conservatory reality and carnival is a synonym of promiscuity according to the values of her uncle and tutor Mr. Osvaldo. Despite all the energies of Osvaldo to remain her private of socialization, Celeste meets Manoel and both have a quick carnival love affair.",
