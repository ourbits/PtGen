    "introduction": "The history of establishment of the Soviet rule. It is this historic epoch that require a radical revision. Hence, no surprise that one-type flicks dedicated to historic and revolutionary themes were replaced with the films whose plots were conveyed by word of mouth by the witnesses of the relevant epoch for many years. These were such films as Surzhekei- the Angel of Death by Damir Manabayev, The Life History of a Young Accordionist by Satybaldy Narymbetov, Zamanai by Bolot Sharip that were made in Kazakhstan; The Orator by Yusuf Razykov, A Single Memory by Sabir Nazarmukhamedov, The Land of Fathers by Shukhrat Abbasov from Uzbekistan, A Stormy Station by Bakyt Karagulov, The Mourner by Artyk Suyundukov from Kyrgyzstan. These movies employed artistic means to restore the historic truth about the tragedy that the peoples of Central Asia underwent at the early period of the Bolshevistic colonisation of the region.",
