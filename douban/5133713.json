    "introduction": "Nikos (Christos Kalavrouzos) returns to Athens, after twenty years at sea, with the intention of finding out how his little brother died. He repairs his old motorcycle and goes out again into the streets at night. He joins a group of thieves and bikers who live a daredevil existence of frequent drag races. In one such race Nikos’ brother was killed. The leader of the group (Takis Moschos), nicknamed Petaloudas (Mr. Butterfly), clashes with an aspiring member who desperately wants to take part in the game. Petaloudas loses and escapes by ship, while the winner is killed at the end of the race.",
