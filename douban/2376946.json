A young couple, Mark and Brenda, inherit the isolated ranch under the condition that they make it profitable within six months. Otherwise, the ranch falls into the hands of sinister caretaker named Solomon who has plans of his own. Joined by a group of their hippie friends, the couple discovers that the ranch, now used to perform wild west shows for locals and tourists, is rumored to be haunted by a headless spectre in search of eight ghostly gunfighters. When the phantom horseman appears during moonlit nights, members of the hippie group are marked for death with the splashed blood of the severed head.A remarkable slice of 70's drive-in shlock that originally played on a double-bill with Carnival Of Blood, Curse Of The Headless Horseman is an ultra-low budget shocker with the cheap look of a 16mm porn film. It should come as no surprise that after making Curse Of The Headless Horseman, producer/director Leonard Kirtman often operated under various pseudonyms and went on to make a slew of hardcore porn flicks. Genre fans may recognize star Maryland Proctor from Psychic Killer, Psycho From Texas and Garden of The Dead. Little cowboy actor Ray Saniger was a stunt coordinator and player in several movies from the 70's through the 90's including To Live & Die In L.A. and Lust In The Dust. Andy Warhol actress Ultra Violet also appeared in several films of wildly diverse quality, including Midnight cowboy, The Phynx and Simon King Of The Witches.",
