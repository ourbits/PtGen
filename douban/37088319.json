    "introduction": "There are hundreds of thousands of suspicious deaths in the U.S. every year. When there is nowhere else to turn, families and law enforcement count on forensic pathologists for answers. Part detective, part physician, and part advocate for the dead, pathologists work closely with investigators to crack the highly questionable cases. Using the autopsy and clues from the victim’s own body, they’ll uncover how the victim died and if it truly was an unfortunate event—or something far more sinister.",
