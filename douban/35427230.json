    "introduction": "The words of a long-lost diary crying out to be heard. The film moves from dramatic narration of the diarist’s descent into hell to interviews with the daughter of the diary’s saviour; from a desperate search for Berkovitch’s fate to a man who witnessed the liquidation of the ghetto; from the archives in Warsaw to actors performing a play on the site of the ghetto from which the diary was written. And what of his call for revenge? The film tackles this delicate subject through the eyes of a Nazi hunter, a psychologist, and grandson of a survivor.",
