    "introduction": "In 1994, up to one million people lost their lives in the Rwandan genocide, and yet today there are those who deny its horrors. With his film, the Belgian director attempts to recall the specific stories of the victims of the genocide so that their suffering is not forgotten. He visits the Rwandan villages where the ruthless killing took place and follows the story of three Tutsi children who were killed. The memories of the surviving locals, as well as the perpetrators of the genocide themselves, provide a chilling account of human cruelty. The second part of the film shows the trials of the perpetrators and asks whether a just punishment can be found for the killers of the children.“The Tutsi was the enemy, the hypocrite, the snake. That is how they were brainwashed.”源自：https://www.ji-hlava.com/filmy/jeden-z-tisicu-kopcu",
