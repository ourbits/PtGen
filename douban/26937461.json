    "introduction": "童年時，雪宜愛看着蝌蚪慢慢變成青蛙； 長大了，雪宜要看着母親慢慢變老。 迎接和送別生命，雪宜依然帶着不安、猶疑。 在照顧患腦退化的母親八年期間，她一直陪伴母親邁向人生的最後階段。 醫生拋出一個又一個母親去留的抉擇，雪宜和家人爭持不下。 在生命去留的課題上，從來沒有最佳答案，她只能由自身學習，只希望找到最靠近初心的方法。In her childhood, Suet Yee loved looking at how tadpole slowly turned into a frog; when she has grown up, Suet Yee has to look at how her mother aged. Suet Yee still feels anxious and has doubts when welcoming new lives and saying goodbyes. During the 8 years when she was looking after her mother who suffered from dementia, Suet Yee was always there for her, to face the last stage of her mother's life together. The doctor offered treatment options that could either keep her mother alive or let her end her life, creating heated debates in the family. On deciding to live or die, there is never a best answer. She can only learn by going through the journey, hoping that she can find the answer that is closest to what her heart feels.",
