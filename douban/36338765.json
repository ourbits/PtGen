    "introduction": "A somewhat-mostly-accurate educational parody film by Max Landis.This production is not monetized, and not for profit.  The clips used herein are used with direct reference, as critique, and the characters and situations depicted are for the purpose of satire.Yes, I know I got some things out of order.  It was condensed and simplified and told from memory.  Did you honestly want this to be an hour long?  You didn’t.  I didn’t.  Let’s be real with each other.  Real respects real.  I respect you.Ron Howard was gonna be in this one too, but he was in Budapest.  He’s wracked with guilt and remorse.",
