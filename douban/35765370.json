    "introduction": "Poverty is the connecting tissue in this powerful, heartfelt collection of monologues commissioned for BBC Arts. Now showing in a feature-length compendium, Skint brings together a wealth of talent on both sides of the camera to tell vivid, heartrending personal stories of living with poverty and homelessness, and how it is used to define who you are. Highlights include Heart Of Glass written and directed by Jenni Fagan and starring Isis Hainsworth, and James Price’s The Taking Of Balgrayhill Street with a tour-de-force performance from Peter Mullan.",
