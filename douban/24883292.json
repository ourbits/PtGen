    "introduction": "Autumn 2011. Campaigning in the federal elections, Christoph Blocher criss-crosses Switzerland to fight for victory. His car is a privileged observation post for filmmaker Jean-Stéphane Bron, who tells the story from the inside, as a first-person account. Over the course of this journey, the life of the most reviled and admired politician in Switzerland unfolds, revealing his triumphs, methods and secrets. How did the son of a poor pastor become a successful industrialist, amass a fortune and win over almost a third of the electorate? L’Expérience Blocher is a portrait of a man who has profoundly changed the country’s political landscape.",
