    "introduction": "In 1987, Marlee Matlin became the first Deaf actor to win an Academy Award and was thrust into the spotlight at 21 years old. Reflecting on her life in her primary language of American Sign Language, Marlee explores the complexities of what it means to be a trailblazer.Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore feels like a full-circle moment. As a child, filmmaker Shoshannah Stern was inspired to believe that a deaf woman like herself could pursue a career as an actor after seeing Matlin win her Oscar. Stern’s directorial debut is an intimate, honest, and loving conversation between two profoundly connected people that weaves together Matlin’s first-person account with interviews from those who know her best.Matlin and the filmmaker’s genuine understanding allows them to explore the good, the bad, and the traumatic throughout Matlin’s career. From the early days and major successes to her famously tumultuous high-profile relationship, to the years of being ignored and patronized by Hollywood, and on to getting sober and repeatedly changing the game for her community — with and without their approval.",
