    "introduction": "''Spin' shows us something we're not supposed to see. Springer trawls unscrambled satellite feeds and discovers beautiful clips of politicians with their pants down. This exercise in pre-web hacking reveals the duplicity of politicians in a televised age.' (- The Yes Men). A film consisting of censored outtakes from TV - of the unpleasant kind, where journalists think that the microphones are off and the politicians are unaware that the camera is still rolling. And as a result some truths come out into the open. The result is solid evidence of the corrupting influence of spin on democracy, and a relentless criticism of American politicians and spin doctors' indifference to the people who are watching them on television.",
