One day in 2008, his sisters are unlawfully evicted from it.This is also about the artist’s country, Mali. A country he has witnessed falling into war – regardless of the tolerance that has been its tradition ever since it gained independence.Such events will lead this artist to speak out and commit himself to the fight for truth.",
