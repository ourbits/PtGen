In the aftermath, Marshall and Leonard discover they have the ability to 'reappear' completely healed after they die, while Dermot survives the accident but is paralyzed. Marshall tries to convince Leonard that they should kill Dermot so he will reappear healed before the police show up, rather than take him to the hospital.",
