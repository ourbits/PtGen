The story moves on and both fall in love. But since her father hates artists, therefore, he decides she will not marry him. Upon her compulsion, her father decided to hire Tusshar as the MD of his company for three months. He has to earn profits in those three months in order to marry his daughter. Company politics come into play and Tusshar falls short of his goals.
