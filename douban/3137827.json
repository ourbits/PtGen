    "introduction": "Honest image of a symbol. The masterpiece of a actor. Page of Romanian history and lost of usual tags. And, form of subtle description of destiny, sacrifice and hesitation. Like every historical movie, \"Horea\" is a power's analysis. The reality before the facts, the words who moves conceptions, revolt and desire and fall.Ovidiu Iuliu Moldovan is a magnificent actor and, like Transylvanian, Horea is for him more than a historical character. He is the hero with mythical connotations, 'King of Dacia\", leader of a movement who transforms rules and destiny, victim of a weak emperor and symbol of freedom. This relationship with his personage is obvious in the subtle acting and in essence of gestures.\"Horea\" is a great Romanian movie for the way to tackle the national problem. In Communist era, the nationalism was the first instrument of propaganda. Ceausescu himself - \"great hero\", \" Beloved father\" and supreme leader is the toy of a brutal image of a gorgeous past who is in his days the result of Communist Party's work. But \"Horea\" escapes of Sergiu Nicolaescu recipes, of \"Cantarea Romaniei\" script. The real facts in that case are not pieces of jingoism or hate legitimation. The result is a poised image of the values of some men and the aspects of a time in a intelligent way.",
