    "introduction": "Nené dreams of playing the part of the devil in her town’s “diablada,” or dance of the devils, but her father Andrés and his girlfriend object, claiming that the role is traditionally played by men. He is also concerned about the recent disappearances of teenage girls in his town, a concern that quickly turns into fear when Nené herself goes missing. Met by the apathy of the local police force, Andrés and a group of families organize and, with the help of a rebellious police corporal, begin their own search for their loved ones.Inspired by the 1998-2001 Alto Hospicio serial murders of 14 teenage girls, “Diablada” is a devastating tale about a community besieged by both a crime spree and government indifference.",
