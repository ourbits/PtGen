    "introduction": "The film was the result of a long held ambition of McCartney, a lifelong film fan, to become involved in acting again after his success with the Beatles' films. Starring McCartney, his wife Linda, Ringo Starr and his wife Barbara Bach, as well as Bryan Brown, Ralph Richardson, and Tracey Ullman, the film details a day in the life of McCartney (somewhat like The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night). The master tapes to McCartney's new album are suspected of being stolen by an employee with a shady past (who has also disappeared), and amid much searching (and music), the tapes are found in the possession of the man in question, who had accidentally locked himself in a shed in a railway station; both are discovered by McCartney. George Harrison chose not to participate in the project. \"No More Lonely Nights,\" a song featured in the film and on its soundtrack, was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and a BAFTA Film Award for Best Original Song-Motion Picture.Simultaneously with the film's premiere in November, McCartney's recording \"We All Stand Together\" was released and became a hit single in the UK, reaching #3. The animated film from which the song was taken, Rupert and the Frog Song, was shown in cinemas immediately preceding the main Give My Regards To Broad Street feature. While Give My Regards to Broad Street was occasionally described in the press as McCartney's first film in 14 years, this was not in fact the case, as Rockshow had been released 4 years before, though it was mainly made up of Wings' concert footage. McCartney had been planning to do more acting after this film but the negative reception caused him to rethink and his next live action films, 1991's Get Back, 2001's Wingspan and 2011's The Love We Make were made up of documentary footage.",
