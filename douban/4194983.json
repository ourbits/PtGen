    "introduction": "In 1962 an unknown group from Liverpool entered Abbey Road Studios to record their debut single. During the next eight years they created what is arguably regarded as the greatest collection of studio recordings of the 20th century.This film charts The Beatles' extraordinary journey from Please Please Me to Abbey Road and reflects how they developed as musicians, matured as songwriters and created a body of work that sounds as fresh now as the time it was recorded.Narrated entirely by John, Paul, George and Ringo and Sir George Martin, the documentary features rare footage and photos from The Beatles' archives and never heard before out-takes of music and studio chat from the Abbey Road recording sessions.",
