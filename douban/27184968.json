This wealth in music, poems, theatre and novels has been created over the last 50 years, and in this film Chico Buarque converses about his memories, shows, daily life, work methods, creative process—in short all his trajectory. The musician’s search for his German brother, whom he never got to meet, serves as one of the axis for the narrative.",
