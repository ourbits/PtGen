    "introduction": "Even though Strauss's operatic setting of the tale of Salome is over a century old, it still has the power to shock as well as enthrall. On stage the story has provoked scandal - violence and nudity are inevitably part of its nature. Inspired by the potent combination of themes, David McVicar returns to explore the psychology of its hypnotically degenerate central character. Nadja Michael performs the demanding role of Salome, and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House under the baton of Philippe Jordan bring their dazzling orchestral virtuosity to the sutnning showipece score.",
