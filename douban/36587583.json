    "introduction": "The director Jorge de Carvalho and his students meet the legendary Colombian filmmaker Luis Ospina in a fake tropical jungle in Lisbon, where a memorable conversation takes place. The documentary takes the viewer on a deep journey into Ospina’s life and his prolific filmography, in which the filmmaker shares his avid cinephilia, from his references to the story of the Cali Group—a group of artists who produced a critical body of work unique in the context of Latin America—, and offers a pungent observation on the History of modern Colombia and the world.源自：https://doclisboa.org/2023/en/filmes/ospina-cali-colombia/",
