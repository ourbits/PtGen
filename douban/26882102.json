    "introduction": "Celebrating the 150th anniversary of the birth of Beatrix Potter, this documentary sees Patricia Routledge following in the footsteps of the Edwardian publishing sensation. She discovers what fired the author's imagination and where her love and understanding of animals was born. As an actress, Patricia played Beatrix on stage in the 1990s. In her present role as patron of the Beatrix Potter Society, and with access to rare drawings, letters and artefacts held at the V&A Archive, she discovers the woman behind the myth.",
