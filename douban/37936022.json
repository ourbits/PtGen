    "introduction": "The Tragic Movement of the Spheres is a mysterious object whose magic lies in revealing – through simple yet hypnotic images – nothing less than the cycle of life. The film is a testament to a mother-son love, but might also suggest to us that the seemingly meaningless and tragic movement of our existence finds its purpose in shared experience. This may seem like a heavy task for a film of only 11 minutes, but Simon Reith’s unmatched idea of filmmaking proves exactly the opposite.",
