    "introduction": "Arrested at the scene on suspicion of murdering bestselling author Jeong Sang-u (Lee Kiwoo), In-seon (Kim Minha) designates Min-ju (Moon Choi) as her assigned detective. Upon arriving in Hongcheon, where the crime occurred, Min-ju discovers that In-seon is actually a childhood friend from elementary school who drifted apart due to a serious incident. Although In-seon admits to all charges, her motives and some of her statements do not align with the evidence, raising doubts. Min-ju exhausts all efforts to uncover the truth behind the case. A Girl with Closed Eyes heightens narrative density and tension with its meticulous structure. It also sharply critiques police incompetence and media malevolence. Unveiling the terror and brutality of this world with stark realism, A Girl with Closed Eyes is a solid and astute thriller, as well as a heartrending film of solidarity.",
