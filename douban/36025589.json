Karen, with a small team, will set out on the town of Carver Cove, a small town in Southern Georgia, in which Tessa used to live and where five dead bodies were also found. Each day, there is a new killing, and time is running out for the team to try and find whoever (or whatever) is murdering the towns residents, and why.",
