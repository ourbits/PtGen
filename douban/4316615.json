    "introduction": "A fairly brilliant take-off of Chris Marker's \"La Jetee\" in that the film is in black and white, told (almost) entirely with still images, but here the sense of fun is higher. A scientist discovers a serum to turn into a dog.Harden has the mode pretty right. French voice-over, pleasant but somewhat droning music beneath. Nice shots of dogs running through the streets of Paris. The \"fake\" aging process on the film looks a little too fake, but it's a lark. Smart and it does not wear out its welcome. It could have made its point at a handful of points, 3 minutes in, 5 minutes in, etc., but he manages to give a nice twist to the plot to keep it going.Be a great opener to \"12 Monkeys.\" Nearly political in tone, too.",
