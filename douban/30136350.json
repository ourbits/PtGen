There is an unspoken past that resonates in his melancholy crying saxophone solos. He walks around a bit lost until he meets Akiko, an elderly woman who takes him under her wing. She drives him around the beautiful green island and in the meantime talks boldly about her own life. As their relationship grows, Alex begins to feel more and more at home.",
