    "introduction": "Marianela Maldonado’s observational documentary charts nine years in the lives of young Venezuelans whose musical talent offer a chance for them to escape poverty.In the heart of the city of Valencia lies the neighbourhood of Las Brisas. Crime and poverty dominate daily life, but for Dissandra, Edixon and Wuilly there is an opportunity to break away. ‘The System’ is a state-funded orchestra programme that gives young talent of limited means a hopeful future. However, as the years pass, the children face new obstacles and when their dreams are almost within reach, Venezuela’s economic instability could jeopardize everything. Maldonado’s film skilfully balances intimate portraits of its subjects with a more expansive overview of a country reaching breaking point.",
