    "introduction": "Maker Eisinga described this performance - which people can now watch - as 'a liberating experience' during which his body was taken over by insects.A man, a table, a camera and twenty-five kilos of bees: this adventure ended in hospital. Artist Jeroen Eisinga’s film performance Springtime is a contemporary rite of passage that leaves neither him nor the viewer unmoved. In his meticulously crafted tableau vivant the maker takes the beekeepers’ sport of bee bearding to the next level. The bees slowly take over his body, and his and our minds.",
