    "introduction": "EVA GRUBER (40) and her husband MAX (45) lead an uneventful married life. Both are well established in St. Gallen's cultural scene; he as an artist and unconventional but popular drawing teacher, she as a cosmopolitan culture journalist. Max has just completed a sculpture for an old-age home, and the unveiling ceremony is about to take place. But the artist himself doesn't arrive at the party his wife organized. Max was arrested by a young and ambitious public prosecutor. The accusation of abuse hangs in the air. Max's attempts to justify himself are quickly swept aside. And the fact that Max often incorporated his own unusual interpretation of the curriculum into his lessons and did not shy away from explicit discourses on art makes his position even more precarious. But for Eva - as for Max - the accusations are absolutely untenable. Instead, Eva sees the media-related and social witch-hunt against her husband as the result of society's increasingly over-sensitized and hypocritical approach to the topic of sexuality. Eva therefore sets out to help her husband and to find proof that the case is a serious miscarriage of justice or even abuse of the law. But she suddenly realizes that her husband has not always been completely honest with her.",
