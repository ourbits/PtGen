Midori senses her mother feels alone and isolated in her long distance marriage, but knows there’s nothing she can do. Midori’s own feelings mirror her mother’s. She spends time with her friends to help fill the void, although it never truely does. Meanwhile, Futa, in the same age, is also without his father. His mother is kind, but devoutly religious and frequently at odds with his rebellious older sister. Every night, Midori and Futa both fall asleep wishing things were different.",
