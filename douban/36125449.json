Although she seems to be an ordinary teenager, in front of the microphone, she gains incredible energy and charisma, thanks to which she can captivate crowds. However, in a testosterone-rich environment, it's hard to find a place for people like her. \"Zadra\" fights for dreams, but most of all for a better tomorrow for his family. Despite this, music is not everything, because love will have a key influence on the main character's life.",
