He moved to Israel from the former Soviet Union with his family in 1990, back when he still had his hair in two ponytails. Today, he has nothing more than an old car and a notebook. He tries to understand why. One day, on the road to Tsfat, the first city he lived in after moving to Israel with his family, he comes across an injured fawn and carries it to the local clinic. Between visits to the clinic and time nursing the fawn, Sasha decides to stay in Tsfat. He finds a job, sleeps in his car, visits every house and places he used to spend time when growing up, trying to catch up with his conflicting memories.",
