    "introduction": "Centrum and Actus, two godly artifacts passed down by the primeval gods, are enchanted with the magic power to bend time and space. Princess Yun of Li and Prince Jade of Yi, who had been childhood sweethearts and engaged to be married, had each inherited one of these powerful items from their ancestors. After Centrum was looted by a mystery man in a scrimmage and its whereabouts became unknown, the emperor of Yi, deranged by power and ambition, took the occasion to wage war against Li. With a former ally turned enemy, Princess Yun was caught in the double bind of choosing between personal romance and national interest. Fate seemed left up in the air for Yun. But as Yun's coronation day to become the Empress of Sun who reigns over eight kingdoms drew close, the truth behind the missing Centrum started to surface.",
