    "introduction": "Two men are in a quiet city remembering their estranged loves from the past. One ruminates her traces with a movie camera, while another writes poetry as he waits. Somehow these two get to know each other and end up work together in a film. Under the winter sky lies a snowfield, and that's where their unemotional gazes start to wander. Crossing the present with the past, remembrance with illusion, the film unfolds the landscape of their inner-selves while questioning the basis of recollection and its cinematic representation. On the last day of their journey, two finally succeed in capturing the images of their beloved ones. It could just be momentary illusions, or the landscape of their inner-selves being externally unfolded. Yoon Jong-Chan's [Views] is a tale of two men grabbing hold of memories and at the same time, an invitation to the mysterious moments. Such beautiful views are too plaintive to accept farewell; hopefully, they will part with memories and discover brand new encounters.",
