In a loose adaptation of Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol,\" Mr. Nezzer learns from a couple of visitors that Easter means more than plastic eggs and chocolate bunnies. The character Hope, voiced by Rebecca St. James, presents the story of Christ's death and resurrection in a song accompanied by a series of stained glass windows portraying the events.  Written by Jonathan A. CullumA retelling of Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol', adapted to Easter, and using Veggie Tales \"actors\", humor, and music. The story framework is a sequel to The Star of Christmas (2002) (V). When Mr. Nezzer tries to knock St. Bart's church down to make way for his new amusement park, Easter Land, he is visited by a vision of the late Granny Nezzer. She tells him to expect a visitor. The visitor, a small angel named Hope, shows him the past, present, and future of Nezzer's Easter, helping him see the error of his ways. Written by EJSawyer on IMDB.",
