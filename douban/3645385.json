    "introduction": "During the 70's, this film was banned in Brazil by the military government's censorship, and even its exportation was prohibited. When there's a crisis in power, the man who holds this power is also personally disturbed. His defeat is thorough and complete. A dictator, in a moment of serious national crisis, confronted in the streets and countryside by revolt and guerilla, makes a long speech on TV, looking for an illusionary peace. But reality is stronger than his fiction, and control gets out of hand. For him, there's only one way out: a pathetic confession and going off the air.",
