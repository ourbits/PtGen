    "introduction": "23 years before George Dunning made film history with YELLOW SUBMARINE he made this very strange, abstract animated short for the Canadian Safety Board. This short, using simple cut-out animation, and the song \"Three--- Blind--- Mice----\" tells of horrific factory accidents that befell three mice that work there. \"They didn't check their machinary....those three blind mice....\" is how some of the lyrics go. A bizarre party film.",
