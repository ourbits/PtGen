    "introduction": "Exploration of a particularly dark zone of the Francoism along with three executioners of death sentences still active in the Spain of the early seventies. Beyond the allegation against capital punishment, the documentary explores the personal story of the three men and their ways of understanding the trade they perform, those executed by them in the garotte or the crimes that are punished. An implacable reflection on power and an atrocious portrait of the society in which those hangmen operate.",
