    "introduction": "While filming a challenge video, famed YouTuber Marvin Weaver accidentally causes a fan’s death, and is swiftly banned from legitimate online platforms. Marvin’s manager, Randi, convinces him to do the right thing and reconcile with the fan’s parents. Unfortunately, Marvin’s half-hearted apology only makes things worse. However, Tag Taggart, an alt-right news host looking to reach younger audiences, invites Marvin on his show. After falling out with Randi, Marvin sees no other option. He goes on Tag’s show to make a public apology, but is manipulated into a cathartic denial of responsibility in the fan's death. With the episode drawing record views, Tag sees a future for Marvin on the show.",
