    "introduction": "ART HOUSE MASSACRE is a nail bitingly tense suspense horror set over one gruesome night. Ben (MARTIN LAURENCE) and Liz (EMILY BAXTER) are a married couple still coming to terms with Liz's recent miscarriage. Too distraught in the weeks after it, she quit her nursing job, and Ben is struggling to hold on to his accountancy job after a round of redundancies. Things are not that great between them right now. In a bid to make some money on the side to help out, Liz accepts a shady modeling job for Philip (RYAN ELLIOTT), an intense photographer who works from his sprawling house in the middle of nowhere. But Philip isn't what he seems... Now: Liz is trapped in the dungeon-like basement of the house, in the clutches of a murderous psychopath with artistic pretensions, and caught up in an organ-harvesting nightmare. Her only hope is Ben, the one person who believes she's in danger It's a race against time to save her, but can Ben get to Liz before she becomes Philip's next victim...?",
