    "introduction": "沈青怀着孕，压力很大。 她照顾着意外怀孕的学生和患有脑瘫的叔叔，后者有被赶出疗养院的危险。 成本不断增加，时间紧迫，但她和丈夫勉强承受。 当她收到自己的孩子有70%的几率先天残疾的消息时，她的婚姻陷入危机，沈青和她的丈夫为残疾胎儿的命运争论不休，而这个未出生的灵魂却同情地观察着一切。周洲导演凭借池韵的强势主演和脑瘫患者的参与，讲述了一个女人在一个对残疾人抱有偏见的世界里遵循自己道德的悲痛故事。 ——贾森·马赫（摘自大阪亚洲电影节官网）Qing Chen is carrying a child and a lot of pressure. She is looking after a student who has had an unplanned pregnancy and an uncle with cerebral palsy who is at risk of being kicked out of a nursing home. Costs are mounting and time is short but she and her husband are getting by, just about. When she receives news that her baby has a 70% chance of being born disabled, it ignites a crisis in her marriage as Qing Chen and her husband argue over the fate of their unborn baby who is observing everything sympathetically.With a powerful leading performance by Chi Yun and the participation of people with cerebral palsy, director ZHOU Zhou gives a harrowing look at a woman following her own morality in a world where some hold prejudice against the disabled.
