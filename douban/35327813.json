    "introduction": "Frank MacGuffin is just another small town cab driver trying to wash his hands of the past. Between fares, you can find him at the local watering hole or writing in his taxi. Indifferent to his father's legacy and disdainful of his mother's bullying ways, he muses on the twisted and bizarre underpinnings behind Fallingbrook's sleepy town facade. Haunted by a recently missing girl, Frank unwittingly begins to piece together the clues which keep falling in his lap. Frank can't help but get his hands dirty, and you know what they say about blood - It takes a lot of water to wash it off.",
