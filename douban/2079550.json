    "introduction": "I'm not a fan of Aussie movies much. Rabbit Proof Fence was shallow, Garage Days tried to be an underground masterpiece but ended up a trashy story that went 20 minutes longer than it should have...crackerjack had a good basic premise -- but stuffed it up big time. So as you could expect ever since Lantana I'd been hoping for the next great Aussie flick, and it's finally arrived...the acting from basically a bunch of new faces (refreshing, seeing that the 'top 5' Australian actors these days appear in everything and it gets distracting easily) is great, the writing is very smart and I guarantee will have you in stitches, the Directorial from Anthony Mir was first class....the way the scenes are executed you could swear its a big name blockbuster.I really thought this film was going to flop but when I walked in and saw around 100 people already seated -- I was glad. I wish the Aussie industry could learn from this and realise that they're only good at making comedies. The drama films they've been pumping out never work for me",
