After that, Asiyah's path crosses with Mahir, an unfamiliar stranger who helps them, who is dragged on an irreversible journey with his children for the sake of protecting his daughter. Mahir, who helps them with humanitarian feelings and takes them to his car, is unaware yet that he will change the fate of both himself and Asiye and their children with this decision he has made.
