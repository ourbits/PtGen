    "introduction": "Más Sabe el Diablo (The Devil Knows Best) is a Spanish-language telenovela produced by the United States-based television network Telemundo.[1] This melodrama features lovers embroiled in intrigue, betrayal, vengeance and unbridled passion.[2] It stars Gaby Espino, Jencarlos Canela and Miguel Varoni.[3] Telemundo says that about 1 million people tune in each weeknight.[4]Set in New York (yet mostly filmed in Miami[5]), the serial features the street-wise Ángel, who treats life as a game he plays to win. He tangles with the power-hungry Martín, who is engaged to a stunning, feisty lawyer named Manuela. She decides to defend Ángel, even though Martín wants to destroy him. Neither of the men know that Ángel is Martín's own son. Our hero learns that love is the only key to survival.[6]Telemundo aired the serial Mondays through Fridays from the 25 May 2009 premiere to the 12 February 2010 finale.[7] As with most of its other soap operas, the network broadcasts English subtitles as closed captions on CC3.[8] This show's working title was ¿Por Qué Diablos? (\"Why Devils?\", though also may mean Why the hell?), which is the name of a 1999 Colombian telenovela it is based on. A compressed version titled “Más Sabe el Diablo the Remix” will air with English language subtitles on the cable network mun2[9].Telemundo added a subplot at the request of the U.S. Government.[10] Perla Beltrán, a character who got a job for the U.S. Census, is used to promote the census to Hispanic Americans, who were (as of 2009) wary of the U.S. Census. The U.S. Census Bureau met with the producers of the series. Don Browne, the president of the television network, said that it maintained \"total creative independence\" during the process.[11]The title of the show is a shortened form of the Spanish saying or refrán, \"Más sabe el diablo por viejo que por diablo\". It translates approximately to, \"The devil knows more because he is old, than because he is the devil.\" It is meant to underscore the significance of wisdom derived from age and life experience.",
