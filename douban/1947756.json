    "introduction": "It still doesn't cease to amaze me how some Silent Movies, dramas or comedies, catch my attention so much, getting me so immersed in the plot, thus making me forget I'm watching a silent, an antique, a piece of history, enjoying the movie as I'd do with any \"talking\" movie.In this case, the images are so real (it was filmed on location) and so hauntingly beautiful, that make many later Hollywood films from the 1940's or 1950's, which depict \"South Seas Life\" look unreal, fake, notwithstanding their possible entertainment value.There's so much truth in this morality photo-play about a white man, identified as a \"derelict\" of the South Seas, previously a doctor, who finds \"Paradise on Earth\" (peace, love & happiness), on a certain island of the Polynesia. Monte Blue is great as this \"white man\".Most of the featured players of the film, one realizes, are real natives from the islands, and this adds so much truth to the storyline. Beautiful actress Raquel Torres, does not seem (IMHO) out of place at all as Monte Blue's native love interest. And Robert Anderson is a very nasty villain.There are some awesome underwater sequences, featuring octopuses, sharks, pearl-diving and others featuring palm-climbing, dancing, etc. Notice the different tinting (reddish, blue, sepia ...) of the sequences of the film; only at the beginning and on the end, plain black and white is used.Great Sound score for this late \"silent film\", the first used for a MGM film and the first time Leo-the-Lion roared! The original South-Sea Islands Film. Excellent.",
