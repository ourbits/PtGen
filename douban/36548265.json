    "introduction": "Largely improvised and without any dialog, the premise of the short is as follows: \"When a young Italian student, an american tourist and an African refugee selling roses each spot 400 euros on a bench, they decide to go on an adventure through Rome's most beautiful locations. At the climax of the short, they will see a young person who needs the remainder of the money more than them and give it away. The film ends with both characters at the Trevi fountain saying they're goodbyes and making a final wish that they will see each other again.\"",
