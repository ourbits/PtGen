    "introduction": "The end of summer in Like Never Before also means the end of a life. Vladimír Holas (Jirí Schmitzer), a painter, is dying. His country home in the middle of a beautiful landscape is his last resort, the death is unavoidable and he doesn't want to die in a hospital. The film has three key characters, the main hero and two women: Karla (Petra Špalková), around thirty five, is somewhat similar to her partner in life: a painter, bohemian, doesn't flinch at using bad language. Jaruna (Tatjana Medvecká), on the other hand, is very different from the other two, a married nurse of approximately fifty five and the maestro's former lover. The three of them lead useless battles against death, against themselves and among themselves –which brings a form of relief to each of them.",
