    "introduction": "Lin Feng, a famous singer, hit two persons on the roadside while drunk. To save his reputation, he asked his driver to take the blame. Tortured by repentance, he traveled as far as Nu Jiang River Valley to visit Xiao Tang’s parents, still ignorant of the truth, blamed their son for causing the accident. They refused Lin’s compensation money in gratitude. Lin Feng, completely lost, wandered into a remote mountain village of Lisu Ethnic people. There he met a kind Yama singing family. Their kindness, purity of heart, and beautiful voice, helped him to find where he belongs. Influenced by them, especially by their unique polyphonic choir, Lin Feng found courage to turn himself in to the police.",
