    "introduction": "An invaluable imprint of the world tour of the play Maria Callas: Letters and Memories, starring Monica Bellucci as the great opera diva. Through the chronicle of the tour, which lasted from November 2019 to January 2023, we observe and compare two different eras (the current one and the one in which Callas reached the apex of fame), while at the same time, we partake to and witness an essential dialogue between the great contemporary Italian actress and the voice that marked the 20th century: two women who, despite their different background, meet in retrospect due to their love of art. After Maria by Callas, Tom Volf collaborates with Yannis Dimolitsas to portray the iconic figure of opera with new narrative tools, looking back to her childhood in New York till her last years in Athens, following her footsteps towards international acclaim, and analyzing her inner demons with profound sensitivity.源自：https://www.filmfestival.gr/en/section-tiff/movie/1306/15353",
