    "introduction": "在新疆草原上，一个传统牧民家庭中的哈萨克少年即将成年。因为青春期的叛逆以及受教育理念与父辈不同，他与父亲的关系并不融洽。家中马匹的走失打破了父子日常生活的平静。在寒冬中，父子俩踏上寻马之路。雪地上的马蹄印也见证着少年的成长与转变。On the grasslands of Xinjiang, there resides a traditional pastoralist family with a Kazakh young man on the verge of adulthood. Amidst the rebelliousness of adolescence and a long-held divergence in educational ideals from his paternal elders, he holds a tense relationship with the traditional shepherd father. And the incident of the missing horses shatters the tranquility of the father and son's daily life at home. In the harsh winter, they embark on a journey to find the horses, with the snow-covered hoofprints bearing witness to the young man's transition to the adulthood.",
