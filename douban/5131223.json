    "introduction": "Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman explores the history of the blues from its beginnings in the despair of work songs to the driving passion of rock and roll. Rare archival footage, interviews, and a treasure trove of essential songs and performances chart the evolution of the blues across America. the evolution of the blues across America.He was called \"the quiet Stone,\" but it turns out that former Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman actually has a lot to say--along with an abiding love for the music that inspired him and his erstwhile bandmates in the first place. This documentary features many of the elements common to such programs: history; nice footage of bluesmen both famous and obscure, both vintage and contemporary; plenty of music; interviews, and so on. But it's Wyman's personal touch that separates it from the pack. Not only does he have an encyclopedic knowledge of the music and a photographic memory (no one who has read his amazingly detailed Stones memoir, Rolling with the Stones, will be surprised that he can tell you exactly where he was when Robert Johnson made his first recordings in the '30s, when Wyman was a baby); but some of the later blues giants, like Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters, are people he played and/or recorded with. Wyman's odyssey is an entertaining and enlightening trip. --Sam Graham",
