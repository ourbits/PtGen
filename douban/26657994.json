Southbrook hospital sits empty and has been that way since the riot in 1986. With the sale of the property pending, the buyers want peace of mind. Enter Eradication, Inc. Damon (Josh Pack), Jared (Joe Moore), Rowan (Eva Marcus), Kristin (Survivor's Natalie Bolton) and Ellie (Sydney Fergerson) are the most sought after Ghost Hunters in Texas and are about to enter Southbrook. Is Southbrook all legend or is there a darker evil lurking in the halls.",
