    "introduction": "Marcos Marquez (Bichir) has just turned 50. He's a serious, respectful, knowing man living in Tijuana, owner of a Chinese restaurant he inherited from his parents. But Marcos isn't thrilled about celebrating his birthday because it reminds him of his vanishing youth dreams.But this time it's different: he's just received an invitation to Clara's wedding, the only girlfriend he ever had, as well as threats from a Chinese mobster who's forcing him to sell his business.Since he hates flying, Marcos decides to drive to the wedding in Monterrey (a city on the opposite side of the country). What he doesn't know is that Fernando (Hernández), his 18-year-old rebellious employee, is riding in his trunk.When Marcos finds Fernando, they're forced to ride together, pushing Marcos to experience things he's never had the courage to do, realizing that even though he's 50, he's still capable of making his dreams come true.",
