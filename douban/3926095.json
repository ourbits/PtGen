    "introduction": "Exposure is a short-film oriented science-fiction anthology series that aired on the Sci Fi Channel between the years of 2000 and 2002. The series showcased the short sci-fi films of both unknown and known (Tim Burton, George Lucas and Kevin Smith) filmmakers, giving rise to the channel's own Exposure Studios. Hosted by actress Lisa Marie, the films presented a wide range of science fiction subject matter. The series received poor ratings and was canceled in the fall of 2002. The series was originally shown on Sundays at 10:00pm EST and was repeated the following Saturday at 2:00am EST, later on the time was changed to 11:00pm EST and still repeated the following Saturday well after Midnight, which probably is a major reason for the poor ratings this show received. The series also had two guest hosts. Terry Farrell (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine) would host the \"Best of Season One\" episode and director Kevin Smith hosted the \"Star Wars Short Films Showcase\".",
