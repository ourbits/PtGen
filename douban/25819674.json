    "introduction": "Nobody Owns Me is a story about Lisa growing up with her single father, he works as a hardener in a small Swedish industrial town - a working class hero, her father slowly breaks down by the ruthless time clock. The fight of social change is confronted by the fear of standing out. Humor becomes a life strategy for a small family during the rise and fall of the “Swedish Middle Way”.After her parent’s sudden divorce, Lisa stays to live with her father. Despite his self-medication with alcohol, their relationship grows stronger every day. They are each other’s best friends and they share a conviction: the idea that all people are of equal value.But as Lisa grows older she is torn between shame and loyalty. Her father is sinking deeper and deeper into alcoholism and one day she is forced to choose – leave him or go under herself. Despite all the difficulties and the inevitable betrayal, Nobody Owns Me is a daughter’s deeply touching declaration of unconditional love for her father, and a promise to pick up the fight for what is right.",
