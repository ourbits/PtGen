    "introduction": "A teenage boy, who has inherited colourblindness and a disfunctional knee from both of his parents, bottles frustrations and anger inside his adolescent heart. His drunkard of a father abuses his mother who says she has no other choice but to stay, and has given up hope of starting a new life. Fed up and hating his life at home, he one day takes up marathon at school despite of his bad knee, and starts running along the field tracks. He continues to run, his malfunctional leg limping, as if to run away from his damned life.",
