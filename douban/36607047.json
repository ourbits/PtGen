    "introduction": "Throughout this season of UNDERGROUND MARVELS, historians, engineers, and experts reveal underground structures that seem to defy human imagination, from Southwest England to Moldova and beyond. In South Dakota, a decommissioned military bunker lies abandoned 200-feet below the ground. Now, 50 years later, how has this massive silo been repurposed for a new generation? In Exeter, England, a mysterious underground tunnel system lies hidden below the city. Who built these secret passageways? And how have they evolved over the centuries? Thousands of miles away on historic Route 66 lies the entrance to a network of deep caves, the largest dry caverns in North America. But how much more remains undiscovered? Whether exploring decades old mines fraught with danger or investigating impossibly complex underground tunnel systems, UNDERGROUND MARVELS leaves no cavern, tunnel, bunker or mystery unturned.UNDERGROUND MARVELS is produced for Science Channel by Phoenix Television. For Phoenix Television, Miles Jarvis and Jaimi West are executive producers. For Science Channel, Lindsey Foster Blumberg is executive producer and Jennifer Gross is producer. © Discovery, Inc. | NewsroomS2 E1 - Hotel Bunker of the ApocalypseS2 E2 - Mystery of the Kentucky CaveS2 E3 - Cincinnati's Secret CavernsS2 E4 - Buried Lab of the Black HillsS2 E5 - Ireland's Underground AlcatrazS2 E6 - Subterranean Silo SurvivalS2 E7 - Italy's Subterranean SecretS2 E8 - Grand Canyon's Lost TreasureS2 E9 - Murder Raid TunnelsS2 E10 - Medieval Maze of Secrets",
