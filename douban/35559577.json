Sophia shares the belief that “although Elena, an award-winning theatre director, herself couldn’t conceive, she is now perceived as ‘mother’ by thousands of children on two continents”. For years her humanitarian project Artists for Children has been helping orphans in Bulgaria and Kenya to develop their creative skills through theatre and art.",
