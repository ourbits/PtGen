    "introduction": "This is Emma Dante's third feature film. The first two premiered at the Venice Film Festival, after which they have been shown in many countries. However, the author has gained even greater recognition as a playwright and theatre director. “Misericordia” is born from a play written and directed by the director, which can still be seen on the stage.Three prostitutes live in the wasteland by the sea, where a village of outcasts has emerged. It is life in a harsh reality of poverty, ignorance, and violence. And the only ray of light in their lives is Arturo, whom they care for together. The young man is a weak-minded child in an adult body. His mother died in childbirth, and the women took him into their care as a newborn. What will the fate of this young man be in an environment he has not chosen and cannot choose because of his disability?Presumably, this work of art would not have been born if the author had not become a mother herself. The film is dedicated to her adopted son. The director, who has a background in theatre directing, has emphasized the theme of general conditionality. At the same time, she has turned it into near-life realism in storytelling thanks to her skilful use of film techniques. The director has said that she is not interested in men as the main character. She is interested in the Woman. As a male viewer, however, it is extremely interesting and instructive to get to know a woman's world through Emma's eyes.Mihkel Möölman源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/misericordia/",
