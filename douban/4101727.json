    "introduction": "Dan Petrescu 59 mins – Tottenham Hotspur v Chelsea, 6th December 1997.Remember when Frank Leboeuf angled a superb ball over the Spurs defence and Dan Petrescu gracefully chipped a stranded Ian Walker to increase the Blues’ lead in a game that eventually finished 6-1 and left White Hart Lane feeling Blue all over?Eidur Gudjohnsen 86 mins – Manchester United v Chelsea, 1st December 2001.Or what about when Eidur Gudjohnsen sprung the United offside trap to calmly slot the ball past a despairing Barthez and cap off an emphatic display that silenced the Old Trafford hordes?Gianfranco Zola 90 mins – Chelsea v Everton, 21st April 2003.But how can you forget when Gianfranco Zola lobbed Richard Wright in the Everton goal from an acute angle, to seal a crucial victory that put Chelsea’s Champions League charge back on track?Re-live these goals all over again and 97 more as we look back at Chelsea’s all-time Top 100 goals of the F.A. Premier League. From Stein to Spencer, from Petrescu to Poyet and from Zola to Zenden, they are all there plus many more. This is a non-stop action-packed Chelsea goal feast.",
