    "introduction": "The surroundings in this film is not merely a background, but a key axis of the images. A young couple from Tehran moves to a temporary residence in a hope to make a better loving relationship. The wife lost all her family members by a car accident, and has somehow become mentally disoriented. The husband quits his job as a photographer, and takes care of her who is suffering in the middle of imagination and reality. However their relationship falls in jeopardy when the car they rented to a new marrying couple gets involved with a car accident. This film is not about a plot but the overwhelming terror of the claustrophobic building which is about to be collapsed. The characters get easily hysterical in this pale blue background which is in contrast with a vast green image of hills which rarely appear. They try to take care of and to protect each other, which ironically leads to conversations that might be either lies or excuses. Their memories are written separately, and the threatened truth leads destruction in relationship. There cannot be an exit without leaping into a new surroundings. (PARK Sungho)",
