    "introduction": "In film, carnivals tend to be sceneries prone to terror. That mysterious environment allows the Adams to play with the manias of Seven, Maggie and Eve, a family of carnies whose hobbies are presenting a show around the US and committing crimes all around the country during the Depression. When one of the killings goes wrong, young Eve is forced to steal a devilish artifact in order to save her parents. This is only a part of the latest insanity by this trio of filmmakers, who once again provide the best example of the DIY model—not only do they direct the film, they also write, produce, edit, star in and musicalize it. We welcome you once more to the Adams family’s blood-drenched universe.源自：https://www.mardelplatafilmfest.com/38/en/pelicula/where-the-devil-roams",
