    "introduction": "This is a sequel to the classic, \"One Froggy Evening\", in which a poor demolition man finds a singing frog in the cornerstone of an old building.The new film depicts the adventures of \"Michigan J. Frog\" throughout history. We discover that his secretive vocal gifts and the human misfortune resulting from them have been repeated throughout the history of mankind. At each epoch of human civilization we see a dim-witted, would-be impresario trying to make money off of a frog that will sing only for him. A caveman, a Roman and even Robinson Crusoe all fall victim to greed upon discovering the frog with a taste for turn-of-the century songs. Each of them meets a fate similar to the poor schmuck from the first film. In fact, the money-mad characters in this film even resemble the character from the original.The animation is first-rate, with none of the plastic-looking, digital sheen of recent Warner Bros. animation. It looks exactly like a classic 50's Warners cartoon short. Chuck Jones really outdid himself with the story, direction and animation found in this film.",
