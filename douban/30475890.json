In order to get hold of it, the powerful are ready to start wars, conquer, destroy, and even plant a zombie-virus. Mico, a bon viveur from Zagreb, whose daily routine includes massage parlours, restaurants and cinemas, where he watches a movie series featuring his favorite actress Franka Anic, is caught completely off guard by the zombie-epidemics. Nevertheless, he boldly embarks on an Odyssey accompanied by his movie heroine, with one highly unattainable, goal: to survive.",
