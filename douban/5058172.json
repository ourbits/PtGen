    "introduction": "urfers are being brutally murdered. Is the culprit a sea monster or just one of the teens' jealous parents?A young girl is killed at the beach in Malibu. Professor Otto Lindsay suspects that it is some form of mutated fish. However, his son Richard, who was a good friend of the girl, thinks that it is a madman who has a grudge against Richard and his friends. Soon the list of victims grows to include one of Rich's surfing buddies, Rich's bitchy stepmother Vicky and his friend Mark who was crippled in an auto accident.At California's Malibu Beach, you'll find everything: hot, hunky, sun-bronzed surfers; bikini-clad chicks stacked to Pasadena; rock n' rollers; beatniks; booze; beer and something else--a hideous reptilian monster with a hunger for bitchin' babes.Dance to the rockin' tunes \"Monster in the Surf\" and \"More Than Wanting You.\" Chill to the ghastly monster as it stalks its prey. Thrill as the surf-studs ride the big ones in a drive-in '60s romp that will scare the yell out of you! Great fun.",
