    "introduction": "Is love nothing but an illusion mixed with memories and imagination? Or is it a fantasy that keeps lingering in one's head throughout the life? 50 yeas ago, a boy and a girl rowed together on the famous outing site in Taipei: the Green Lake. 50 years after the trip, as the once-invincible old man shares the story on that clear summer day, one becomes bewildered by the indescribable connection between the boy and the girl. No one is sure what really happened, except that all the sceneries upstream along the lake remain mesmerizingly appealing. 90% shot on the lake, Rowboat captures what we all experienced: a crush.",
