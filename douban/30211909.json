Thousands of young migrant workers come from a remote village on the highlands of Northern Vietnam. Now they lives in a Hanoi suburb, a district developed around one of the biggest industrial production sites in the world. Thes worker' life strictly follows the rules of the great Industrial Park. Every single woman is apparently following a stereotype of tireless work and obedience to keep up with the pace of industrial production. Step by step the movie reveals the bases upon which the productive chain is built: the conditions in which the young workers are into, the tight control and the difficulties on the workplace.",
