    "introduction": "Reticent Saruul loves to draw, but at the wishes of her parents, she is studying nuclear engineering instead. One day, a friend slips on a banana peel and breaks her leg. She asks Saruul to fill in for her at her part-time job at a sex shop. Although it seems like the least likely job for Saruul, her friend, hoping that Saruul would be the most discreet about her secret job, convinces her. The work involves selling all kinds of oddly-shaped pleasure enhancers, making occasional deliveries, and delivering the day’s earnings and cat food to the shop owner Katya at the end of the day. Saruul starts working at the shop, and over time she grows fascinated by Katya, who seems to know all about things that she doesn’t know or hasn’t experienced. The two women’s special friendship changes each other’s lives. Charming direction and music in unexpected places stand out in particular.",
