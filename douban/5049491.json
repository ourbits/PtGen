    "introduction": "Meet the inhabitants of the \"Casa di Riposa\" in Milan, the world's first nursing home for retired opera singers, founded by composer Giuseppe Verdi in 1896. In his documentary film Tosca's Kiss, which has developed an underground cult following over the years and is a favorite among opera and music lovers worldwide, director Daniel Schmid has captured a world in which these wonderful singers (many of whom had significant careers on the opera stage) re-live and re-enact their triumphant roles of the glorious past. Tosca's Kiss is a touching and often hilarious film on the subject of aging and the power and timeless capacity of music to inspire.",
