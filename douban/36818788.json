    "introduction": "Fleeing the misery of a year in lock-down in Melbourne, El and Sim, a couple in their 30's, relocate to the Byron Shire to pursue a unique opportunity. El, a poet, is the subject of a new video masterclass produced by the charismatic and domineering author Christian Divine. While El is drawn by the intoxicating pull of the local creative scene, Sim's own writing career is going nowhere. As their relationship strains under the pressure of jealousy and deceit, Sim's desire for a family seems increasingly incompatible with El's burgeoning career. The love that binds them begins to unravel.",
