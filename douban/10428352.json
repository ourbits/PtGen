    "introduction": "A Christmas Wedding Tail is the story of a pair of passionate pooches, Labrador Rusty (voiced by Jay Mohr, \"Ghost Whisperer\", \"Jerry McGuire\") and Poodle Cheri (voiced by Nikki Cox, \"Unhappily Ever After\", \"Las Vegas\"), who fall head-over-tails in love. The two smitten pups conspire to get their respective owners, Susan (Jennie Garth, \"Beverly Hills 90210\", \"What I Like About You\", Girl, Positive) and Jake (Brad Rowe, Your Love Never Fails, National Treasure: Book of Secrets, \"General Hospital\")  to wed. Despite Susan's and Jake's compatibility, their new blended family - with five kids! - turns out to be more than Rusty and Cheri had bargained for. Now, the calculating canines must put their poochie powers to the test to keep their family from ending up in the dog house. A Christmas Wedding Tail proves that a little puppy love can go a long way.Jennie Garth (90210) stars as Susan, an unemployed Los Angeles museum curator and widowed single mom temporarily living in a small Californian town with her three sensitive sons. Jake (Brad Rowe, General Hospital) is a single dad of two tomboys who owns a local winery. When Susan's dog Rusty (Voiced by Jay Mohr, Ghost Whisperer) falls for Jake's poodle Cheri (Voiced by Nikki Cox, Las Vegas), these canine matchmakers help their owners fall in love too. Now with a Christmas Day wedding to plan - and major complications threatening to unravel it all - can two mismatched broods find a way to make one happy family? Tom Arnold and Catherine Hicks (Seventh Heaven) co-star in this heartwarming holiday film from the producer/director of The Dog Who Saved Christmas Vacation and Your Love Never Fails.",
