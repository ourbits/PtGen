    "introduction": "June 6th, 1944. A titanic fleet take on the beaches of Normandy. Their goal: liberating Europe from Hitler's yoke. Thanks to the lessons learned from the Dieppe raid of August 42, and supported by the Provence landing of August 44, the mission is a spectacular success: the Second World War Allies succeeded in moving beyond their political differences, overcoming logistical difficulties and carrying out an operation with unprecedented military stakes. How, before and after D-Day, did the authorities, soldiers and civilians experienced this turning point in history?Narrator: Mathieu KassovitzProduction: CC&C, Mediawan",
