    "introduction": "Jessica Sarah Rinland’s mesmerising debut feature-length work intimately examines the process of museological and ecological conservation through the production of a lab-engineered replica of an elephant tusk. Working alongside conservators in various institutions across the world, Rinland traces the tusk through its many stages of construction, revealing the exacting craft and care involved in the physical reproduction of the natural world. With tactile, tightly framed 16mm photography and delicate, detailed sound design, Those That, at a Distance, Resemble Another is a close study of the people and processes behind the production of museum objects, and a probing inquiry into the act – and art – of preserving and constructing history.",
