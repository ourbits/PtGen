    "introduction": "The lucid madness of Marco Ferreri is a journey into the unique cosmos – both supernatural and terragno – of the author. A man who abandons veterinary studies but never animals, choosing to deal primarily with the human being in his bodily and desiring essence. To get closer to the jagged and organic world, for some obstinate Ferreri, the film offers clips of his Spanish, Italian and French films, including El cochecito, The bitch, The last woman, Dillinger is dead, The big binge, Asylum seeker , Hello male, Story of Piera, The monkey woman. We listen to the controversial director reflecting on the name of “provocateur” who has always followed him, perennially accompanied by censorship, scandals, protests, poisonous accusations.",
