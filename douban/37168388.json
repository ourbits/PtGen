    "introduction": "The village priest must call upon the last nine remaining habitants to dig up the graves of their relatives and move them to the top of the mountain, to make space for the newly deceased. The spirits of those long gone awaken to fill the profound emptiness of this depopulating island town. This docufiction has a classical approach that befits the island, with the same gentle timelessness of the people it captures.",
