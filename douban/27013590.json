    "introduction": "Bhu Tenzin- My Son Tenzin is a story about an elderly Tibetan monk from Tibet who visits San Francisco Bay area to look for his long-lost son, Tenzin. As the luck would have it, the monk who doesn't speak and understand English meets a young Tibetan cab driver at the San Francisco International Airport. The driver then offers a free ride to the monk to go to his son's place. But to their surprise, Tenzin had already moved out of the apartment long time ago. The cab driver has no option other than keeping the monk at his residence for some time. Although many Tibetans live in the bay area, no one seems to know much about Tenzin and his whereabout. While finding Tenzin, they begin a memorable journey that will change the life of the monk and the young Tibetan cab driver forever.",
