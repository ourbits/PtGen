    "introduction": "Basque Country, 2009. Lide is a security guard for the high-speed train works, a project that generates social protests in the streets. Coming home after work and partying all night, she makes breakfast for two, but her teenage daughter, Ane, is nowhere to be found. The next day, she’s still not back. Lide isn’t particularly worried, believing that her disappearance is probably connected to their huge argument of the previous day. Looking through Ane’s things, she gradually realises that her daughter is a stranger to her. Together with her ex-husband Fernando, they set about investigating their daughter’s whereabouts. The two immerse themselves in Ane’s world, an activist, unstable and adolescent space. Ane is the story of a search, of communication and lack of it, of care and carelessness, of works and reconstructions, because all relationships have a little of each. Debut film.",
