    "introduction": "A revolutionary, fighting against dictatorship in Brazil, is wounded in a gun-fight with the police, and is isolated in another man's apartment, where he meets a young woman who will change his life.A Movie about Despair, Lost Tenderness and Redemption. Cabra Cega tells the story of Thiago, a young marxist guerilla man that is severely injured during a confrontation with the Brazilian police.The year is 1971, and Brazil's third and worst military president, Medici, controls the country with iron fist, crushing every dissident voice that appears on the political scenario.Thiago, being tenaciously chased by the police, is forced to \"cool down\" on a house of a leftist sympathizer. There, with his access with the outer world completely broken, he faces loneliness and despair.His only contact with the world outside the tiny apartment is Rosa, the militant responsible for bringing food for the injured combatant. She is his only company, and his escape route. Together, they will need to face the hostile world that surrounds them.Accurate, sensible and austere, Cabra Cega is a movie about despair, lost tenderness and redemption. Worth every minute.",
