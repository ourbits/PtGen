    "introduction": "Even a bird needs a nest', is a documentary film about forced evictions in Cambodia, a phenomenon that is raging throughout the country. The government grants land concessions to powerful companies who use them for commercial purposes. However, some of these belong to the people. Facing threats, intimidation, and a corrupt justice system, those who dare to protect their land risk their lives doing so. In Phnom Penh, the state capital, residents of the Boeung kak district are forcibly evicted from their homes, obliged to live in relocation camps, without basic services and infrastructures. Furthermore, the camps are far from work opportunities. Those who refuse the government's proposition, have their homes bulldozed by the private companies, with the violent assistance of the police forces.",
