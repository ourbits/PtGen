    "introduction": "The show follows the misadventures of the infamous Black Hat, a vulgar and sharply dressed narcissistic inhuman fiend who does his part to make the world a little more vile and its heroes a little more dead. Aiding him (with varying degrees of consent) are his cohorts, meek scientist Dr. Flug, the neurotic and adorably failed bestial genetic experiment 5.0.5, and his biggest (and most violently deranged) fan-girl Demencia. Written by Cameron Iacono",
