    "introduction": "This film is reality based on fiction. It's director Aneta (lives and works in Holland) mixes her life and those of her friends with a fictional situation that she has invented herself. As most of her friends in her home country Macedonia are actors and filmmakers who do everything but act and direct (due to no funding possibilities in a land in transition), she decides to give them false hope in order to make her film. Aneta lies to her friends that she found producers who will fund her film if they will help her out by sharing their life stories. She films the whole process and what was meant to be the making off becomes the actual film. Does it hurt? is the first Balkan, as well as the first Dutch film shot according to the Dogma rules and is the directors 10 year celebration gift to the Dogma movement.",
