    "introduction": "A film report from the Dar Pomorza (Pomeranian Gift) sailing ship's training voyage to Stockholm to celebrate King Gustav V's 80th birthday. The film shows the daily life of the sailors on board the ship, including physical exercise, entertainment and playing with the crew's mascot, the anteater Bear. \"Dar Pomorza\" was a ship of the Polish merchant navy in the 1930s and at the same time a training ship of the Maritime School in Gdynia - in 1930 it replaced the former sailing ship \"Lwów\". It was on this ship that the future sailors of the Second Republic of Poland gained experience. Thanks to the reportage \"Dar Pomorza to Stockholm\", it is possible to see the ship at the time of its greatest glory.  The film was reconstructed in 2022 based on two copies found after the war in the USA and the Soviet Union.",
