    "introduction": "The grey and depressing British industrial town Hull was a suitable place for a nihilistic avant-garde collective, which at the end of the 1970s aggressively confronted every conceivable taboo: sex, pornography, violence and self-mutilation. But COUM Transmissions was only the beginning. Led by the artists Genesis P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti, COUM soon mutated into the visionary, transgressive and absolutely uncompromsing industrial/noise band Throbbing Gristle, who were famously named ‘the wreckers of civilisation’ by a shocked conservative politician. Throbbing Gristle reinvented music by destroying it, and has to this day set an untouchable standard of radical otherness. The many rare archival clips already speak for themselves, but ‘Other, Like Me’ is an oral history narrated by the former members on screen for the first time.",
