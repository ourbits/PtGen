    "introduction": "Once upon a bedtime,in a place a lot like here,there lived a boy, let’s call him Danny,who dreamed to one day disappear.It wasn’t sticks or stones that hurt him,and though he pretended not to mind,so often words, a lot like weapons,would seek him out to be unkind.Though unlike any of his classmates,he held a cosmic kind of hope.He studied space stations and star maps,each night behind his telescope.A true explorer of the infinite,to him, it really was child's play.His knowledge spanned each constellation,that shone throughout the Milky Way.So, on a day that didn’t matter,he trundled home with a heavy heart.This is the story of the Spaceman,and it’s the perfect place to start.",
