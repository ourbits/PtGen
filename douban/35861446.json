    "introduction": "2022 Winter Olympic Games will be held in Genting Snow Park ChongLi County  He Bei province of China. As part of the venue and supporting facility construction, Chessboard Ridge, a village near ChongLi County was set to be demolished, villagers relocated, making way for expressway exit, parking lot and high speed train station, etc.This film records the whole process, documenting the original landscape of the village, including a small old Catholic church, the daily routine, and the real situation of contract signing, moving, demolishing of the houses, as well as the fallow up scenarios of various relocated villagers. Spanning four years, the project aims to give a candid and balanced perspective on the great change thus brought about of the land, the village, and the people.It’s experimental, as the whole video-audio recording has been done with iPhone in 4k-60fps format. No additional equipment was applied.",
