    "introduction": "Urban community gardens have a long tradition both in the Czech Republic and internationally. While they are often categorized as public vegetation, they function mainly as private gardens. Capturing four seasons of the year at a community garden, the film shows the clash between the old and the new. While the senior gardeners have been working on their lots for decades, taking good care of them, growing fruits and vegetables in an invariable rhythm, new gardeners have appeared over the past few years, bringing new approaches such as community gardening, shared responsibilities, and return to more ecological methods. Over the course of one year, we follow a new gardener as he joins the community garden and clashes with the established ways of nature maintenance.",
