    "introduction": "Seems like an ordinary trip to a remote beach. Four young women enjoy the warmth of the sun, the coolness of the sea and one another's company. None of them is \"Winona\". They spent the day on silly games, girl talk, songs and dance. Laughter punctuated by tears, the tears washed away by make believe. Slowly the day comes to a close and our four heroines must say goodbye. An unassumingly mysterious and deeply moving story revealing itself with a language of intimacy, woven out of love and grief. Its secret will be kept till the very end.",
