    "introduction": "Back in the days of video games, Martino, an 11 year old boy, wonders if the tree in the courtyard of his building is bored of never escaping the four concrete walls that surround it. He takes a shopping cart and sets out to discover the world with his new green friend. An innocent and ironic adventure that brings children and adults close to the forgotten universe of nature and imagination. And an ending that leaves hope for a better world through the imagination of children.",
