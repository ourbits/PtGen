    "introduction": "Working with archival images from a key historic moment—the Iranian Revolution—the image-based study explores notions of duration (cinematic and historical), memory (virtual and image-based), and their sensory and emotional (affective) impact as historical and potentially ‘revolutionary’ themes. Repetition is explored as a principle of memory, as an aesthetic device, a space to inscribe meaning. Repetition is also explored as historical mimesis, as an eternal return, and as a possibility for reinvention. Finally, repetition is a means to question the role of agency in human nature. This image-based study is a work in progress and is carried out incrementally, whenever the need arises to examine, excavate and repeat the memory.",
