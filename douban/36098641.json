    "introduction": "Feng, a wrongly convicted former prisoner, tries to start a new life, looking forward instead of backward, in the City of Light. Since his release from prison, he has known that his past will come back to haunt him one day. That moment arrives when a pregnant young woman comes to ask him to save the father of her child; Feng’s son, Jun. Feng discovers that, since his arrest, his estranged son has become deeply entangled in a life of crime and is now in hiding near the border between China and Myanmar, where a river runs through the jungle. Criminals cross the border to escape from the crimes they have committed. Feng must find his son before it’s too late for him to return. He makes a deal to smuggle a package across the border himself to repay his son’s debts. However, the price that awaits an absent father in order to redeem himself, in the jungle on the border, will be way more than he can afford to pay.",
