    "introduction": "Acclaimed Shakespearean thespian Claire Bloom takes viewers on a made-for-TV romp through the women's roles of William Shakespeare in script, stage, and screen, many of which Bloom herself played in the decades of her classical theatrical career. Not only does Bloom read some of her most prized excerpts from her favorite of the famous playwright's works, but she also gives commentary to short screenings from some of the most famous film adaptations of his work, including herself with Laurence Olivier in 1955's Richard III. Other plays cited in this presentation include Hamlet, The Merchant of Venice, and As You Like It. In addition to chronicling some of the great works of Shakespeare, this video also toasts the career of the actress made famous by his work, and chronicles her successes, interpretations, and lifetime achievements in the arts.",
