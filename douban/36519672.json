This stunt was orchestrated by the Municipality of Tel Aviv as a 'White Surprise' for its residents and as a tribute to the winter Olympics in Torino. That same morning, the Dahan family, who resided in front of the city square and had fallen on difficult times, were facing an eviction notice, effective immediately.",
