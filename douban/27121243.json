    "introduction": "Always a master of color, Belson creates in Mysterious Journey a rich palette of hues in subtle metamorphosis which leaves the critic grasping at exotic fruit analogies (mango, papaya, etc.) to describe them. Also the imagery seems constantly in change, layered with rarely less than three actions transpiring at the same time, often melting into one another or transforming into something else quite different--and evoking a central spiritual mystery: is it being, the cosmos, that changes? Or the individual mind that wields an unstable perception? In either case, this flux is compelling, fascinating, fluid as auditory music that impells you forward, and like music yielding fresh perceptions and emotions with each subsequent viewing.",
