    "introduction": "Andres (Conrad Valenzuela) lives with his mother (Celina Font) and his older brother in Santa Fe. His mother is separated from her husband (Fabio Aste) and the relationship with your ex becomes increasingly strained. Following an accident, she dies suddenly, and both Andres and his brother Armando will have to live with his father and his mother (Norma Aleandro). The relationship between parent and children is rigid, albeit unconscious \"war\" for power erupted between Andres and his grandmother Olga, a war that resulted in the tragedy. On the other hand, adjacent to the family home there is a clandestine detention center, a \"secret\" that everyone knows and prefer silence.",
