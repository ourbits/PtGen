    "introduction": "Agon was a short-lived series in Japan, Agon being yet another giant monster who smashes buildings and leaves destruction all over. But this one is a lot of fun, the action starts pretty early and the monster destroys all the miniature buildings and sets with a lot of enthusiasm. I have it in the original Japanese language form, and it doesn't make a difference as you just wanna see giant monster action, which there is a healthy dose of. Directed nicely and fast-paced. There's also a tan-ish \"tint\" over the b/w film stock. All in all it's not a Godzilla movie but it is a lot of fun to watch if you can find it.",
