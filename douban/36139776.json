    "introduction": "José Celestino Campusano continues his task of exploring territories that haven’t yet been covered much by Argentine cinema, but with which, film after film, he managed to configure his own universe. This time, the prolific filmmaker traveled to the locality of Gálvez, in the province of Santa Fe, in order to collect town life experiences and, with them, shape his new feature. The Naked Queen is the result of this journey. Campusano’s sensitive gaze is set on Victoria, who has just suffered a miscarriage and a breakup. As she becomes involved in a legal issue that has to do with her father’s inheritance, the young woman tries to modify her hurried lifestyle.
