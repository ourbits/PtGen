    "introduction": "It is the Summer 1982. With the war raging in Lebanon, 13-year-old Gal works as a postman in a moshav nearly emptied of men. On his daily rounds he meets Haya, a 19-year-old girl suffering from heart disease, who corresponds obsessively with several soldiers in Lebanon. Only one soldier, the one who happens to write the most beautiful letters, doesn't send her his photo.The touching character of Haya enchants Gal, who becomes increasingly involved in her life. While she anxiously awaits the photo of the soldier, whom she has never met, Gal realizes that he has found his first love. He shares Haya's heartbreak and takes it upon himself to personally bring her the photo and defy death. In the surprising and heroic events that follow, entertaining in their naivet~~~~~~, Gal attempts to reach that soldier in the midst of the war in Lebanon.This is a film dealing with the connection between coming-of-age and death, about a boy's first love for a young woman. It is a love story that, despite its futility and the tragic ending, remains optimistic.This film was produced with the support of the Greenhouse Project Children and Youth films – Jasmine TV for HOT",
