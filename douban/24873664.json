    "introduction": "Following the atomic destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, internationally acclaimed novelist Nevil Shute prophetically and emotively predicted the devastating impact of nuclear proliferation in one of the most important anti-war novels of the 20th century, On The Beach, in which he depicts the end of the world caused by nuclear war. FALLOUT explores the writing and impulses of Shute's career and novel, and its adaptation into the famous film shot in Melbourne by Hollywood message director Stanley Kramer. FALLOUT investigates the ambience surrounding Shute’s prophesy of ‘man and machine out of control’ and the mismanagement of nuclear energy and the importance for all of us to be ever vigilant in the post Fukushima age. - See more at:http://www.documentaryaustralia.com.au/films/details/1544/fallout#sthash.OzryUSPL.dpuf",
