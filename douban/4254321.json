    "introduction": "Following the establishment of the East India Company in 1857, some Mughals, led by Sarfaraz Khan, decided to rebel against their British masters, killing many, and forcing others to flee. Three women from the Labadoor family, Grandma, Mariam, and Ruth, seek shelter with a local money-lender, Lala Ramjimal, who would like to recover his money from the Labadoors and has a vented interest in their survival. But he is unable to keep their presence secret, and Javed Khan and his men storm into his home, and take the three women to Javed's house. Under normal circumstances, these three would have been beheaded and Ramjimal and his family severely punished, but Javed would like to make Ruth his second wife. Mariam and Javed's wife, Firdaus, strongly oppose this move, but Javed is clearly obsessed by Ruth's beauty and nothing will deter him from marrying her. Then things gets really complicated when Ruth starts having feelings for Javed, and the British seek retribution for those killed by the Mughals. Written by rAjOo (gunwanti@hotmail.com)",
