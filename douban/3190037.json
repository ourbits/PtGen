    "introduction": "Frunze Dovlatyan (1927 - 1997) is one of the leading Armenian directors, he has started as actor in Armenian provincial theatres since 1941 and then Sundukyan Drama Theatre of Yerevan where he was awarded Stalin Premium (major award of that time) for the role of Hrair in the play \"These Stars are Ours\". After graduating the Directing Department of VGIK (master class of Sergei Gerasimov, he directed movies at Gorky Film Studio then at Mosfilm Studio. Since 1964 he was working at Haifilm Studio. His movie Barev, yes em! (1966) became a milestone and turning point in the history of the Armenian cinema.The achievements of Frunze Dovlatyan and Henrik Malyan are outstanding during this period. \"Hello, It is Me\" and \"Triangle\" are two films shot by these directors that play an important role in the history of Armenian cinema. A contemporary theme underlies these films and the author's vision drastically turns towards the deep understanding of the secret of the contemporary personality, the \"inner world\" of the man and the problems of his presence in this world. \"Hello, It is Me\" is a film of wide scope about an Armenian physicist and the trials his generation experiences, the feelings of responsibility so characteristic of him, and how he cannot forget the burdens of his past, and about love.",
