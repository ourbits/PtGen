    "introduction": "Puebla de los Angeles, Day of the Death, 1807. Leo is a fearful and insecure child but he must confront his fears and enter to an old big house to rescue his brother Nando, who has been captured by the Nahuala, a powerful and wicked ancient spirit. Once inside the house, Leo will defy fearsome creatures and will meet friendly spirits that it will help him to overcome tramps and riddles to face the Nahuala.A wonderful movie, very Mexican, in the tradition of being Mexican. Appreciating the movie, however demands certain amount of culture (particularly Mexican) and a knowledge of Mexican legends. The performance of the actors and actresses is absolutely traditional Mexican and it takes a Mexican to really understand it. I hope they make more movies like this. The amount of Mexican legends and traditions is vast and it is very refreshing to see something like this (as opposed to all the trash from commercial cinema aimed at children). There is nothing scary about this movie, it is completely clear that it is pure fantasy and based on traditional legends. The really scary part of this movie is how it has \"upset\" so many adults, confirming once more, the lack of sense of humor and ultimately how devoid of common sense are so many people in this \"new\" era of \"marketing at all costs\".",
