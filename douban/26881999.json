    "introduction": "Three undocumented teenagers - a Dominican girl, an African boy, and a Peruvian girl - are just about to graduate high school in the Bronx. Like most teenagers, all they want to do is hang with their friends, fall in love, and figure out where to go to college, but unlike their American classmates, these three live with the threat of being discovered by the authorities. When one of their teachers connects them with a lawyer to help them get their papers, the teens start to dig into their family histories to assist their immigration cases. As they continue to deal with the everyday problems of adolescence, the teenagers are forced to confront their past and, at the same time, fight for their future.",
