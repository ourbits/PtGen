CHARIVARI a fashion UPROAR is a documentary film recounting the story of one of America's most influential high-end clothing retailers; from the inspiration for the opening of the first store, how it \"grew into a retail mini- empire on the previously fashion-starved Upper West Side of Manhattan\", and to all of the ripples and waves it has made in the fashion world up to present day.",
