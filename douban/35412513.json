    "introduction": "Already in production with France, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Switzerland and Germany, Facing Darkness will plunge into the heart of the 1325 days of the siege of Sarajevo (April 1992 - February 1996). The first part of the documentary will be made up of film clips shot during the siege by young filmmakers who took their cameras with them as they defended their city concretely and militarily. The second part of the film will be made up of interviews with these filmmakers who today testify to this singular experience. Aged between 18 and 25 at the time, some had voluntarily joined the army, others had been mobilized, and still others had preferred to be integrated into the civil protection. How and why did they start or continue making films? Did they pick up their cameras as they might have picked up guns? 25 years later, they remember the dark experiences they had.",
