One day the man asks his friend Maledivivere to take her a message in which he announces his imminent return. But Francisco is killed in a fight between rival gangs. Lúcia shows up for their meeting, but waits in vain. Maledivivere has to break the sad news to her. To Lúcia, this means giving up any hope of escaping from her life and its oppressive system of values. The woman in the end accepts António's love.",
