His creation was an installation for two screens that was presented within the scope of the 1995 exhibition The World of Photography. The film Interface (Schnittstelle) developed out of that installation. Reflecting on Farocki's own documentary work, it examines the question of what it means to work with existing images rather than producing one's own, new images. The German title plays on the double meaning of \"Schnitt\", referring both to Farocki's workplace, the editing table, as well as the \"human-machine interface\", where a person operates a computer using a keyboard and a mouse.\"--3sat television guide, September, 1995",
