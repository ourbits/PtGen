    "introduction": "“Wonder” is set in a near future and revolves around the death of Noya, a 17-year-old girl who was apparently killed in a car crash. Her father Avner, a retired combat officer, and Daria, Noya’s best friend and a social media personality, join forces to investigate her death and discover Noya had a secret virtual life as part of a growing movement of teenagers swept up in the world of “wonder” — a new and mysterious virtual reality gaming app. Avner, who was mostly absent from Noya’s life, now faces a series of shocking revelations about his daughter. His and Daria’s investigation, along with flashbacks into Noya’s past, gradually unfolds the dark chain of events that led to her night-time accident in the desert.",
