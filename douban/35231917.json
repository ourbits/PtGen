    "introduction": "A documentary crew travel to a remote village in England to capture the lives of notorious cult 'Friends at the End'. F.A.T.E were once a growing religion but, after a miscalculated doomsday prediction in the 1950s, membership has dwindled. In recent years F.A.T.E have been linked to disappearances of former members, the leader Daniel Love has gone into self-imposed exile, and this year their crops are failing. Except the potatoes. In need of money, the gang recruit new member Rachel, at a local rehab facility. Rachel breathes new life into the group and, when she turns the head of lifelong member Comet, old relationships begin to fracture. As the comet that F.A.T.E believe will bring with it the end of the world approaches, the group's beliefs are tested. New secrets emerge which threaten everything the cult has been working towards.",
