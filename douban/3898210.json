Was premiered in 1976 and is based on the eponymous play by the same director. This was the first film produced in Venezuela with financing from the state after the critical and commercial success of When I mourn no tear (1972) and Wallerstein Mauritius Mexico's burning of Judas (1974) of the same Chalbaud.In Caracas the oil boom and the pacification of the 1970s, the former guerrilla Pedro Zamora returned to the capital and move to the pension of edicts, which becomes one more tenant. Despite appearances, Zamora came to play a revenge that is willing to carry out: to kill Diego Sanchez, the commander of the group that killed his fellow guerrillas.",
