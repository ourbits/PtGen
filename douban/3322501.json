Oh, did we mention that the craft services dude, Chicago, ends up playing the lead? But his role is perhaps short-lived unless he can save the film crew, who has been taken hostage by Hollywood superstar Richard Lynch (played by himself). Can Chicago save the day? Perhaps, if he does what any good actor does. He must improvise.",
