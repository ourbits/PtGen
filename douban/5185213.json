    "introduction": "The drama unfolds within the confines of an AFL locker room (colloquially – “the sheds”). Cunningham twists and turns aspects of masculinity like a Rubik’s cube. The emotional and philosophical conflicts between the three characters are where this show works best, but there are times when the acting, as well as the drama, seemed a little forced.",
