    "introduction": "It’s a blast from the past when the Croods find a man frozen in a block of ice, they thaw him and discover he was an old flame of Gran’s! When Grug saves Hope’s life during a dangerous mountain-side tartichoke harvest, rather than feeling grateful, Hope is desperate to save Grug’s life in return in order to not be indebted to him. And determined to show Hope that she’s just as good a cook, Ugga decides to cook a meal that will wow the farm residents. But when Ugga realizes she’s out of her element, she turns to an unlikely place for help: the punch monkeys.",
