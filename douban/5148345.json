    "introduction": "I didn't expect anything as I never read the book of Calaferte, nor I've seen any movie done by the same director. I even didn't know any actor except (surprise) the singer and former model Amina. I must say too that I am not against boring movies, I love Pasolini, Tarkovski or Kubrick, because their boring movies give me something anyways : great stories, things to think about for a whole life, great characters. I must say too that I'm not against movies talking about sex, whether they do it in an artistic, politic or even pornographic way... Well well well... Here, we have a self-contented movie about women and sex. The author (of the book ?) doesn't know much about women I'm afraid (but I'm sure he has a she-cat), and the director can film anything but sex (good point is that the actors won't be embarrassed but what they did on screen, as it is never even a little \"hot\"). But that terrrrrible movie, really terrible, is well photographed. The night scenes of Paris peripheric boulevard are nice, all the outside scenes are nice actually. That's one good point. For the rest, well, well, well, Mr director, pick a good book next time.",
