    "introduction": "This series explores the most extraordinary and sometimes deadly engineering disasters around. Why did a brand-new bridge suddenly and tragically collapse? How did drilling for oil trigger the largest whirlpool the US has ever seen? And which Paris landmark hid a deadly design flaw? From a skyscraper that threatened to rain lethal chunks of marble over downtown Chicago to a gas pipeline that shook southern Spain, we uncover the engineering that created the chaos.With access to design teams, eye-witnesses and a panel of experts, we analyse what went wrong, investigate why errors went undiscovered and reveal how engineers are working to prevent future disasters.S3 E1 - Curse of the Swamp MonsterS3 E2 - Nightmare in FloridaS3 E3 - Curse of the Devil's DamS3 E4 - Terror in TacomaS3 E5 - Crash of the TitanS3 E6 - Houston's Hurricane HellS3 E7 - Chicago's Tower of TerrorS3 E8 - Boston's Big Dig DisasterS3 E9 - Olympic Stadium FiascoS3 E10 - Deepwater DisasterS3 E11 - Apollo 13: The Secret Evidence",
