    "introduction": "How can something so beautiful be so feared? Priceless, precious, and perilous, the Hope Diamond has been a gift to the world, but some say, a curse to those who have possessed it. Trace the epic journey of this famous 45.52 carat gem, from it's origins to a journey across three continents - passing from monarchs to thieves to millionaires - to its final home at the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History. This mythic stone has inspired superstition and passion and its enigmatic past has been a marvelous riddle... until now. See \"Embracing Hope\" the spectacular temporary setting, voted by the American public and designed by world-renowned jewelers Harry Winston, inc., in celebration of the 50th anniversary of its donation to the Smithsonian.",
