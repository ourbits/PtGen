    "introduction": "I AM THAT GIRL is the story of Maxine, an anti-typical Asian American woman who lives a life of partying, funded by her eighty-thousand dollar credit card debt that she pays for by working at her ten-dollar-an-hour desk job. Desperate for affection, Maxine grabs hold of 'Noodle,' an enigmatic wanderer on his way to the Sierras, and convinces him to take her on his road trip where she discovers the beauty of nature. On their journey, Maxine falls for Noodle, but his haunting secret keeps him distant. Part comedy, part drama, I AM THAT GIRL is a love story that truly captures the spirit of D.I.Y. film-making and comments on American credit card culture while revealing the beauty of the simpler things in life.",
