    "introduction": "They live in the Warsaw district of Wola, in a social housing estate inhabited by alcoholics and people living in the margins of society. Who got a chance, moved out of the estate. The building will soon be torn down, only those who have nowhere else to go stay in it. Among them are Bartek and Paweł. They have known each other for years and were inseparable. Growing up in an orphanage, 21 year old Bartek, came to live with his alcoholic parents when he turned 18. Paweł is a couple of years older than Bartek, and when he was a teenager, he became a father. He lives cooped up in a tiny apartment with his partner and daughter. Bartek works in a poultry slaughterhouse and wraps up meat all day long. Paweł is jobless, he is an amateur boxing coach and wants to practice mixed martial arts professionally. Soon he is to take part in his first illegal fight for money.",
