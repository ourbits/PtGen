She realizes that her escapes are a form of withdrawal from her parents and the grown up world.Monika manages to convince Mr. and Mrs. Hagedorn that their daughter is not mischievous or insidious but that her parents should consult a Psychotherapist with her. But as usual all the therapists are booked out and have a long waiting list for patients. So Ute is left alone once more with her helpless parents and she is more and more drawn to the zoo and her beloved crocodiles.Thanks to Monika’s sense of responsibility and her commitment, Ute manages to break free from her isolation.”",
