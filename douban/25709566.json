    "introduction": "A 1968 entry in the BBC's venerable 'Omnibus' series, wherein film historian/collector/director/impresario and cheerleader without portfolio Kevin Brownlow asks the Musical question, Why has Abel Gance, this relentlessly inventive film artist of almost occult formal gift, been so comprehensively forgotten?It is a question, admittedly, more pressing in 1968 (when Gance really was languishing in cinephilic obscurity) than in 2011, when a handful of his masterpieces . . . with no small thanks to the prodigious labors of Kevin Brownlow . . . are readily available to those who would seek them out, but that doesn't make Brownlow's decades old quest any less compelling.",
