Despite his fellow Korean student soldiers' advice, he does not repent his behavior. He then gets to know Hurasen, a woman resistance soldier, who fights for the independence of Burma. Through her, he realizes at heart the sorrow and anger of the oppressed people. Then, finally, he turns his barrel toward the Japanese invasion army and joins the Burmese independence front. By the time, he meets the independence of Korea on the 15th of August.",
