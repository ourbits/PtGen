    "introduction": "The hottest girl in school, a $10,000 dress, a prize-winning Pomeranian dog, vintage low-riders, Mexican gangsters and champion body-builders. It's prom night and Brad's got a lot of things on his mind...Bradley Miller gets a final chance for excitement in his otherwise boring high school career when Stefanie, the hottest girl in school, auctions herself off as a date to the Prom. He wins the bidding by promising her the pink Ralph Lauren dress Gwyneth Paltrow wore to the Oscars. But what Brad didn't count on was the dress's $10,000 price tag or that Stefanie's parents are World Champion Body-Builders who will crush him if he doesn't make their princess happy. Brad's best friend, Angela, has a plan to get the money that involves pawning Brad's Mom's prizewinning Pomeranian dog to buy a vintage low rider to sell to a Japanese businessman in order to buy the dress, unpawn the dog, get to the Prom and not get killed. But Brad's Mom is on her way home, Stefanie's parents are waiting for him, the low-riding gangster he had to cut out of the deal is after him, and to top it all off, Brad's beginning to think he's asked the wrong girl to the Prom.",
