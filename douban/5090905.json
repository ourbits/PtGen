    "introduction": "This is the Summer of 1943 and the place is rural France. The weather is fine and sunny and life is sweet. On one of these beautiful days, Nanette, a fourteen-year-old peasant girl, meets a slightly injured young man near the farm she lives on. Named Claude, he claims to be an English paratrooper, sent there to organize resistance to the Nazis. Although her parents have taught her to worship Pétain and the Germans and hate the English, Nanette accepts to hide him in the attic. Day after day she brings him food and cares for him. It does not take long before she falls in love with him and discovers the ecstasy of physical love. But after she has helped Claude to come into contact with the local resistance fighters, he disappears.",
