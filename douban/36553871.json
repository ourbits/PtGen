    "introduction": "Somewhere in the mountains between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Anne and Nuri know each other only a little. Nevertheless, they have come here from Berlin to spend some time together at his parents’ house. She wants to write a screenplay, he wants to make progress on his master’s thesis. But instead they splash around in the pool, relax and chat – about Germany, Israel, their ex-partners. Every now and then, a rocket appears on the horizon and is intercepted by the Iron Dome. Very gradually, Anne and Nuri edge closer to one another, exposing themselves while at the same time maintaining a protective shield. Sensitively and sensually staged, the erotic game of attraction and distance is allowed to run its course. - ›Salty Water‹ deals with being genuinely open towards others. It’s a vignette as if taken from life and, for all its lightness, it achieves great profundity.",
