    "introduction": "A bored youth, a bored fish, a can of pop - the results are explosive!In a sparsely furnished living room, a man with a wide mouth and toothy grin watches his large goldfish, whose head and face closely resemble his own. After a while, the man's attention is diverted to a can of soda pop. When the can reacts spectacularly to being opened, the goldfish sees a chance to make a sea change, into something rich and strange.",
