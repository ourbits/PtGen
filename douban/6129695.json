    "introduction": "Lena Sander is a good-hearted, spirited, attractive young woman. She lives in Cologne since her birth and became a trained clerical worker. A profession Lena hasn't much fun with, which leads for her to climb from job to job. Lena is living together with her boyfriend of six years, Tony Weiss, and with his eight-year-old son Luca, whom she loves like he is her own child. And her parents Frank and Pia live together with her younger brother Michael right across the street. Lena has a normal life with which she is pretty much pleased. But the day Lena meets Amelie von Arensberg, her life is about to change. After a bad day, Lena almost runs over Amelie with her bicycle. She brings the confused countess home, where Lena meets Amelie's grandson David. Between Lena and the composer begin sparks to fly - but both are in a relationship.",
