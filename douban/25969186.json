    "introduction": "When Clare Church left the Greater Manchester Police (GMP) in the mid-90s, she turned her back on a world of misogyny and chauvinism, where it seemed you had to think and act like a man to succeed in a man's world.Ignored in the office and second place in her relationship with her married DI, Clare found solace instead on the remote island of Canna, with her new man, Norrie, and daughter Megan.Now, as four bodies from Clare's past investigations are unearthed, Clare finds herself getting pulled back in to a world she'd long since left behind and a case that only she can solve.Battling her own demons, Clare feels the dual pull of a vocation that sustained her and a man she once loved… but can she protect herself from the darkness this time?",
