    "introduction": "A film tribute to our friend Jonas Mekas. Re-working imagery from our 2005 work Drift, Leah Singer and I created this film to honor Jonas. First projected at a memorial evening not long after his passing in early 2019 at 96, with live accompaniment by me, it has been re-edited with a new soundtrack. It is being presented at Ki Smith Gallery, 2 locations in Manhattan, as part of the group exhibition To Jonas With Love. 197 E 4th St and the larger 181 Mott St (where our piece is) November 18-December 20, 2020. Jonas was an inspiration to both of us, the model of a consumate artist, always inspirational! The original material is Leah's unique technique of 16mm film loaded and shot in a still camera and projected in special analyzer projectors at variable speeds, forward and reverse, a body of work that was in progress when we first met in 1989.",
