    "introduction": "The story of the film is about the tiny tenor Ricardo. He is famous and loved because of his beautiful records and radio performances, but more than anything else he would like to perform on stage. Because of his exceptionally small stature nobody dares to take that risk. When he finally succeeds in getting a stage contract, it appears that he has to perform, dressed as a clown, a comical act together with his handsome friend Rigo (played by Viktor de Kowa). Ricardo is very disappointment, but decides to do it anyway. A stage is a stage. And besides, he is in love with record saleswoman Nina (played by Charlotte Ander) and that seems to be the only matter that counts. Until he finds out that Nina is actually not in love with him, but his friend Rigo. Ricardo is not happy in love, but at stage, in the end without his clown costume, he gives a fantastic performance.",
