    "introduction": "This is the poignant untold story of warmth and compassion after a terrible war. Thousands of Jewish survivors, landed in Southern Italy, after WWII, on their way to Israel. To their surprise they were welcomed by the poor locals. In this time of psychological and physical healing, hundreds of children were born. The film follows the story of three Israeli women who were born then, in Santa-Maria-Di-Leuca. The film weaves rare historical footage with unique current testimonials capturing a ray of light after great darkness.",
