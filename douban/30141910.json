    "introduction": "Game Girls follows Teri and her girlfriend Tiahna as they navigate their relationship through the chaotic world of Los Angeles' Skid Row, aka the \"homeless capital of the U.S.\" A dilemma fuels the tensions between the two women: if Tiahna has resigned herself to a life of fending for yourself and petty smuggling in the streets of Skid Row, Teri is driven by a powerful desire to move on. Together with other homeless women, they attend a weekly Expressive Arts workshop where they are looking to reflect, dream, and heal. Can their love survive the violence of their past and their current environment?",
