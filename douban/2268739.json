    "introduction": "The \"April Morning\" here is the famous April 19, 1775 upon which the \"Shot heard 'round the world\" was fired, signalling the start of the American Revolution. Faithful to author Howard Fast's somewhat revisionist view that the skirmishes between the Colonial militia and the British troops in Lexington and Concord (Massachusetts), were precipitated as much by fervent American patriots led by Solomon Chandler as by any \"Redcoat\" belligerence. Written by Robert James O'Brien",
