    "introduction": "I don't understand some people. If Govinda stars in his \"Govinda Comedy's\"they say Govinda does the same rle over and over again (nobody says that Shah Rukh does the same thing which he HAS been doing ever since Dilwale Dulhan ia lejayenge -double standards anyone??). But when Govinda tries to do something different like in Chhote Sarkar (Divya Dutta, Shilpa Shirodkar and Kadar Khan(, Shikari (Tabu and Kareena Kapoor) or this Albela co starring Aishwariya Bachchan and Jackie Schroff with Namrata Shirodkar, everyone strats crying! Such double standards. At least Govinda is trying in contrast to Shah Rukh who is either Raj or Rahul in all his crap movies. The story of the film is different (actually a little based on Roman Holiday (Audrey hepburn and Gragory peck) which was already done in Tabu's first released movie Pehla Pehla Pyar starring Rishi Kaoor. Only this time the story is more Indianised. The songs are above average. Govinda gives a damn good performance. Jackie is just about okay. Aishwariya is nice but Namrata steals the show from Aishwariya. Okay, she's not as good looking as her sister Shilpa but she can act. Though must say Govinda and Shilpa were much better together in Aankhen, Hum and the forgettable third flick which name i forgot. Still worth a watch",
