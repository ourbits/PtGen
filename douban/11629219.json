    "introduction": "Pistrino is composed of time-lapse sequences shot in north west Umbria, Central Italy. Most of the shots are made to a uniform plan, which involves taking one frame every minute, thereby compressing a long summer's day into about half a minute. The film invokes some pre-cinematic technologies, mainly shadow plays, which are manifested as the movements of trees and other objects cast by the sun onto white walls, and onto other surfaces, including patches of sand, which both emulate and interact with film's grain.",
