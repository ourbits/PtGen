    "introduction": "\"Rua São Bento, 405\" is more than just an important address in São Paulo's downtown: it's the place where the Martinelli Building is located, the very first skyscraper built in Brazil and for many years the tallest one in Brazil and South America. The short documentary gives a brief presentation on its years of elegance and cultural point to the then 1970's decadence after being taking over by the government - who evicted its residents of whom we have the chance to hear some of their stories. —Rodrigo Amaro",
