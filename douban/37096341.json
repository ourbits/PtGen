    "introduction": "The Inquisitor tells the story of Barbara Jordan, an American politician, lawyer, educator, and public servant. Jordan’s ethical principles and interrogational skill served the United States at pivotal points in history, from the revision of the Voting Rights Act to the 1987 Supreme Court nomination hearings of Robert Bork.During the impeachment hearings of President Nixon in 1974, Jordan was a 38-year-old junior Texas congresswoman. During a speech recognized for its political oratory, she reminded listeners of the constitutional agreement made for the collective experiment of democracy. With praise from both political parties, she earned the title of ‘inquisitor.’ Jordan’s political purpose became clear then—to compel people to ask hard questions and face the answers. One week later, Jordan was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. At the height of her career, Jordan left politics but continued in public service as an educator and ethical guide for leaders such as Bill Clinton and Ann Richards.While Jordan’s political legacy is the center of The Inquisitor, the film also looks at her personal life. Colleagues and friends, as well as the public, learned of her illness only after her death. The Inquisitor explores Jordan's intersectional identity navigating a landscape of politics and discrimination.",
