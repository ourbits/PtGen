    "introduction": "The former shepherd, Jean Lassalle, decides to run in the presidential election. Neither one nor two, Pierre Carles and Philippe Lespinasse, two filmmakers labeled left, but a bit politically lost, decide to take action: They proclaim themselves his campaign advisers, with the secret ambition to reveal his true nature, that of an anti capitalist revolutionary, lost among the centrists for 30 years. And if Jean Lassalle, after all, was a Correa with Bearnaise sauce? Against all odds, the mountaineer qualifies for the first round. Victory? Our spin doctors nickeled feet and their champion are not at the end of their surprises .",
