    "introduction": "1978年鄧小平設立深圳為經濟特區，廣東經濟迅速發展。無數工廠拔地而起的同時，也吸引了無數人來此淘金。30多年過去了，當初離家的青壯年也已至中年，而廣東也漸漸成爲了打工的代名詞。繼續吸引著一批批對未來迷茫而又渴望成功的新一代年輕人。本片即围绕三个90后工厂男孩的故事展开 。In 1978 Deng Xiaoping set up Shenzhen as a Special Economic Zone in China, and this decision led to the rapid development of Guangdong economy. Numerous factories have been established, millions of people are attracted because of gold rush. Over 30 years later, young people who were away from their home have already stepped in the midlife. Guangdong has become a representative of job hunting and has been drawing a newly young generation who has faith and uncertainty to the future. This video revolves around three working-class boys who are the 90s generation.獲獎經歷獲2014臺灣南方影展全球華人競賽人權關懷獎♦ Human Rights Award, Chinese Films Competition, The 14th South Taiwan Film Festival, 2014.第二十二屆北京大學生電影節第十五屆大學生原創影片大賽評委會特別獎♦ Special Jury Award, The Fifth College Student Original Film Competition, The 21st Beijing College Student Film Festival, 2014.第五屆大連藝術影展主展映單元♦ Screening Programme, The 5th Dalian Art Film Festival, 2014.第二屆重慶青年影展主展映單元♦ Screening Programme, The 2th ChongQing Youth Art Film Festival, 2015.",
