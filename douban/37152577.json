    "introduction": "Just as disco was collapsing amidst a fiery backlash, young Chicagoan Vince Lawrence embarked on a journey that would change music history. From his father’s record store to the underground clubs of the South Side, Vince and a group of visionary friends experimented with drum machines and synthesizers, crafting a revolutionary new sound: house music. Elegance Bratton’s joyous film is an electrifying tribute to the pioneers who turned a local scene into a worldwide phenomenon. With rare archival footage and vibrant interviews, the film chronicles how house music transcended genre trappings to become a movement of liberation, unity and pure, undiluted bliss.",
