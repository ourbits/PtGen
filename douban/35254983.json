As she avoids starting a new book, spending more and more time on Facebook, her husband, an ambitious TV writer, begins a demanding new job as a show runner on a sitcom. As both have fantasies about other people, they navigate the challenges of commitment. A relatable, sometimes funny exploration of our obsessions: the pursuit of success, happiness, social media, nostalgia, monogamy, and the meaning of life.",
