    "introduction": "An old rich aunt offers to her nephew – a 35-year-old orphaned bachelor, to make a bet. If he - Chakalov, succeeds to captivate the hearts of 14 women and the old lady sees with her own eyes these 14 kisses, she will leave to him her enormous legacy. Chakalov is forced to accept the old lady’s offer and to play the role of a seducer. But by nature, he is not that kind of person and this puts him in countless funny and awkward situations ending up in absurd outcomes. Chakalov’s endless love for books and their world, rather than for easy living leads him through the maze of the craziness of surrounding life.",
