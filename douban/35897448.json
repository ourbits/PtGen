    "introduction": "A triptych about projections on bodies, made by projecting on my body. In the spring of 2021, I found myself pulled by two different research projects, one about a person who lived in the 1880s who was being co-opted and re-co-opted by projections; the other is a story of a 17th-century poet who for a moment managed to escape the self he was shut up in when he was born.",
