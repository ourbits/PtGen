    "introduction": "A group of young girls take a renewed look at the female body and art history in a simple but original guided tour through the world of culture.Old norms and truths are being re-evaluated, even in museums. A group of girls and women aged between 7 and 19 comments on the paintings and sculptures at a German museum. The female body in art history, power and authority, and beauty ideals - it all changes with the times. The girls’ immediate reactions and thoughts are both profoundly insightful and full of surprises. But more than attitudes are at stake in a film that uses professional depth to explore the contemporary in (art) history - and vice versa. The approach is simple, but Shelly Silver’s original guided tour has a broad reach.",
