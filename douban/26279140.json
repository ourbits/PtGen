    "introduction": "The story of the tragic life and glittering career of the French singer who, despite numerous personal setbacks, became a music icon. It explores the harsh realities of Piaf's private life and features interviews with her childhood friend Mômone and her accordionist Marc Borel. Extracts from Jean Cocteau's play Le Bel Indifférent, written for and starring Piaf, as well as an extraordinary interview at the time of her manager's murder, makes this a truly unique documentary, offering a rare opportunity to understand the emotions behind some of the most dramatic ballads of the 20th century.",
