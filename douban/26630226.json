    "introduction": "Yan Can Cook is primarily based off of entertainment. Yan is in fact a good cook, and at the same time, he is overall a great entertainer. The best part of the show is when Yan constantly repeats \"Oh look at that\". The first time I saw this show was July 4th, 2000, and I was very impressed. Yan has very good cutting skills, and he is also very creative. His show sort of bogged down a bit since then. In his new shows, he made a different beginning intro, and he has changed \"look at that\", into \"Can you smell it?\" Probably the best cooking show on TV today. The show is great, Yan is a great entertainer, and a great cook that has great cutting skills. I give this cooking show a 10 out of 10. Call me crazy, but I love this show.",
