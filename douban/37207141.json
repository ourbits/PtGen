    "introduction": "As girls, they dreamed of growing up to perform like Daniel Day-Lewis, Nicolas Cage, Goldie Hawn — even an Ewok. As women, they have turned in some of this year’s most daring and moving performances. In November, Annette Bening (Nyad), Lily Gladstone (Killers of the Flower Moon), Greta Lee (Past Lives), Carey Mulligan (Maestro), Margot Robbie (Barbie) and Emma Stone (Poor Things) gathered in Los Angeles for THR’s annual Actress Roundtable. And while they have taken on weighty work, in this conversation it became clear the industry’s leading ladies are really ready to laugh at themselves.Annette Bening ('Nyad'), Carey Mulligan ('Maestro'), Emma Stone ('Poor Things'), Greta Lee ('Past Lives'), Lily Gladstone ('Killers of the Flower Moon') and Margot Robbie ('Barbie') join THR in Off Script With The Hollywood Reporter. The stars talk about how their families react to their work and getting comfortable on a set. Plus, Margot Robbie shares how she was able to pitch 'Barbie' to Warner Bros. and Mattel in this updated roundtable format hosted by Yvonne Orji.",
