    "introduction": "A 13-year old KID leaves his home and starts a journey along the Venezuelan coast. In order to survive, he captivates people by telling them anecdotes from the Mudslide Tragedy. Sometimes he is rescued by his mother, who sacrifices herself to save him; some other times it's his father who dies. These stories, however, reveal some of the truth, and his past becomes clearer. Ten years ago, a mudslide tore his world apart. Many disappeared, his mother among them. Now the memories, carefully threaded by his father, contradict each other and push him to search for his own story. He has a difficult road ahead of him, where he will also find his own universe of affections and feelings. While crossing the desert, the KID doesn't know whether to laugh or cry, but the crack in his soul is starting to heal.",
