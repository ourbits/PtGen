    "introduction": "20 years ahead of its time in addressing the issues surrounding people without fixed addresses, this film also explores the cruel ways humans often interact with each other, the ignorance responsible for those actions, and the accidental event that transforms the antagonist into one who better understands the events surrounding the misfortune of others. Set In Manhattan's Central Park, this film is the poignant story of a teenage girl's encounter with a homeless old woman (movingly portrayed by distinguished actress Mildred Dunnock) who carries all her belongings around in shopping bags. This encounter eventually leads to the girl's understanding of the problems of aging and the dignity of all individuals, regardless of their place in society.",
