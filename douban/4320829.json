    "introduction": "Single mom Michaela has been unemployed for a year when a job offer brings her out to a wellness hotel in the countryside near Berlin. The hotel owner being a survival freak, her only chance to get the job seems to be to join a 5-day-survival-training with Tom, whom she dislikes at first sight. Not so her son Oskar, who unlike his mother is an outdoor freak and admires Tom fervently. Tom's daughter Sonja, on the other hand, thinks that fashionable Michaela is pretty cool. The rest of the team are Jack, would-be Bundeswehr hero, Gisela, workshop-aficionado and lover of trees, and Rashnapur, an Indian cook who got lost. Not to mention some other creatures moving among the trees of the forest.",
