    "introduction": "Writer and ex-pat Marina receives an invitation to her school reunion. Overtaken with nostalgia, she flies from Europe to the small town Novoustinovsk in which she was born, a town which was then part of a country that no longer exists. Here, much has changed and clocks keep track of a new era. In this middle of nowhere, she finds only her memories and her old girlfriends. Yet even they are as ephemeral as the TV shows of a different lifetime. This is a common story about the fates of regular people, about quarrels, about spiritual growth, about falling, about hope, and about the volatility of memories.",
