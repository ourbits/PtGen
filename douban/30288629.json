    "introduction": "Julio is a young adult with poor social skills. He works in a laundromat trying to avoid clients and hiding his shyness behind pieces of other people's clothing. One day he finds a curious object in one of the pockets and he discovers a different side of himself, a side that enjoys sneaking into other people’s houses to steal their most intimate belongings. He starts to discover a whole new world, populated by different and fascinating people, halfway between fantasy and reality. But who cares, isn’t fantasy far better than reality?Alex Muñoz in his debut manages to convert the story of a social dysfunctional young man in a captivating and engaging urban tale, a story of loneliness & alienation, romance and hidden desire and yes, even love. Loneliness is a constant in today's life, let’s accept it, but through an amazingly created cinematic world, the filmmaker makes Julio an intriguing and charming character who dives into the paradoxical feeling of lonesomeness both while being in a crowd and on his own with his stolen things. Together the fluid camera movements, a map of evolving sounds and perfect music track choices transfer the film into pure poetry and a search for love. Will Julio find it?",
