However, she starts getting visions of a girl. At first, she dismisses it as hallucinations due to her PTSD. However, she finds out that the girl had died 20 years ago. On the pretext of writing a book, she starts investigating into the matter and finds striking evidence which otherwise could never be found. Things point to certain prominent people of the place, but then they end up dying one by one. Alisha doesn't know that she has put her own life in danger. How far will one woman go to give justice to a dead girl? The answer lies in that incident which happened 20 years ago. The incident which shall tell the world - The Other Side of Her story.",
