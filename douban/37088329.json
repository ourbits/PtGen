    "introduction": "On a thrilling ride, we spin back in time to an extraordinary prehistoric world: Alaska in the Cretaceous period, 70 million years ago – the last great flourish of the dinosaur era. BBC Earth invites you to come on a journey through the seasons, and experience a year in the life of dinosaurs fighting, feeding, migrating, playing and hunting.Spring signals new life as many species of dinosaurs start to lay eggs, rearing the hatchlings to ensure a chance of survival. But as the young grow through summer, they are vulnerable to predators like the Troodon. Cool autumn months spur the dinosaurs to migrate, but not without risk from natural catastrophes and packs of Gorgonsaurs hunting. In winter, temperatures drop and the sun ceases to rise. As spring approaches, the mature dinosaurs go in search of a mate. For the Pachyrhinsaur, scientists believe the frill on its head could help to attract a mate or do battle with a contender. Once mated, the pair will migrate back to their nesting ground to start their own family.With the most ambitious CGI visuals, this film reveals the story behind the lives of the dinosaurs and the challenges they faced in a constant battle of survival.",
