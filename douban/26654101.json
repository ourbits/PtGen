    "introduction": "Beirut, September 1994: the systematic reconstruction of the city has begun. The civil war has been over for two years. Randa Chahhal, a Lebanese filmmaker whose family was politically and militarily involved in the conflict, depicts these seventeen years of war from a very personal viewpoint. She questions her family and uses her personal video collection and the 16 mm movies she made between 1975 and 1994, returning to the ruins of a city whose reconstruction marks the passing of a part of her life. Is it possible to miss the war?",
