    "introduction": "This story follows Drew (played by emerging musical artist, Vyse), an aspiring young rapper as he is faced with the life struggles that led to his residence in a group home while balancing his job, untamed anger, family life and the pursuit of his musical dreams. Deacon, a music studio owner, sees Drew's natural talent as a gift that he can develop and takes him under his wing. Blinded by his fast rise, Drew does not see the corruption that lies beneath Deacon's involvement and the destruction his success has caused to his friendships and family. This honest narrative shines a light on the very real struggle to succeed in the music industry while surviving on the streets of New York. The fierce competition and at times fatal consequences are the reality Drew faces as he forges his own path in search of fame, fortune, love and ultimate redemption from his past.",
