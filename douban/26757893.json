    "introduction": "Chavela Vargas and Federico Garcia Lorca are the main characters of this story . Poetry and music are the places of their meetings . Chavela explains that when she lived in the same room where Lorca studied decades ago, she was visited by a bird that contained the soul of the Spanish poet. In her last year of life, Chavela fulfills her last wish: to make a tribute to Federico and finally meet him in the ranks of death. The Nightingale and the Night, is a documentary that chronicles the transition from life to death of Chavela, her union with Lorca, dissolving the borders between reality and dreams.",
