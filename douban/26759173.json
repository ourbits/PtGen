    "introduction": "What is it that saved Tokyo from a nuclear disaster? A pool of foreign journalists, including reporter Pio d'Emilia (Sky), is allowed to enter the Fukushima-Daiichi power plant: they have waited two years to uncover the truth about the 2011 accident hidden behind those walls. The ex-premier Naoto Kan takes us back to the days of the accident and reveals the events as they really happened. Manga animations represent Japan's history, while digital reconstruction allows for the darker side of this story, which is so complex from a social and scientific point of view, to emerge. There are no mere suspects anymore: many defendants are to be held accountable for the accident.",
