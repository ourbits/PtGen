    "introduction": "A unique experience that immerses us in the history of experimental 3D techniques. Programmed and presented by filmmaker Blake Williams, the spectator will combine a diversity of three-dimensional glasses (Anaglyph, Pulfrich, ChromaDepth, Diffraction) with 16mm works by Paul Sharits, Hy Hirsh, Ken Jacobs, Takashi Ito, Kerry Laitala, Jeff Scher and Jodie Mack. Filters that change from one eye to the other, optical polyrhythms and illusions of depth, all will be part of this unforgettable Cinema of the Spectacles‘ journey.",
