    "introduction": "《好时光，坏时光》是一部 1969 年加拿大电视纪录片，由唐纳德·谢比布 ( Donald Shebib)创作，约翰·格兰尼克 (John Granik) 担任旁白，其中穿插了战时镜头对退伍军人的采访。谢比布对战争和加拿大退伍军人社会地位的描述是直率且“非浪漫化”的。该片广受好评，是谢比布最杰出的短片。它荣获加拿大银幕奖最佳纪录片长片奖。Good Times, Bad Times is a 1969 Canadian short television documentary film created by Donald Shebib with narration by John Granik featuring interviews with veterans intercut by wartime footage.Shebib's presentation of war and the social status of Canada's veterans is blunt and \"non-romanticized\". The film was well-received and is Shebib's most distinguished short film. It won the Canadian Screen Award for Best Feature Length Documentary.现存的BBC第一次和第二次世界大战纪录片中的战斗镜头和老照片与第一次世界大战退伍军人的当代镜头交织在一起，回顾他们在加拿大皇家军团大厅、阵亡将士纪念日和退伍军人医院的经历。Combat footage and old photographs from extant BBC documentary footage from the First and Second World Wars is intercut with contemporary footage of First World War veterans[4] recalling their experiences at Royal Canadian Legion halls, memorial day commemorations and veterans' hospitals.",
