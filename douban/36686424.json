    "introduction": "South of Sanity is a dark comedy spanning from 2018-2022 and follows Lacy Hilgreen, a recovering addict, and her dysfunctional Alabama family through the flea market circuits of the Deep South. Fresh out of rehab, fresh out of money and fresh out of options, Lacy is forced to leave Los Angeles and return to her home in rural Alabama and help with the family business to make ends meet. The flea market is no place for a recovering addict, however, as the family uses their booth as a cover for their meth operation. Using the code word \"wholesale\", customers of the Hilgreens' booths can purchase some of Alabama's finest crystal. Sex tapes, STD's and meth-laced candies are just a few of the topics tackled by South of Sanity, not to mention the family's dealings pre, mid and post pandemic. The Hilgreens keep it brutally real in its depiction of recovery, redemption, and hilarious roadblocks encountered along the way. Lacy is joined on her journey by her brother Mike and sister-in-law Ila, who run the family flea market, her hellion nephews Rowdy and Ryder, wild niece Rebel, Ila's cousin and resident alcoholic Jeff, her cousin Tori, the only \"sane\" one in the family, and a one-night stand that lasts way longer than planned. SOMETIMES THE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE IN, IS THE ONE THAT MAKES YOU FEEL THE MOST ALIVE.",
