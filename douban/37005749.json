    "introduction": "In the Historical Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina, alongside a monument to Josip Broz Tito, the body of a Zenica miner has been found. Everything points to suicide. Inspector Mido Zec decides to look into the details of the case, which takes him to Zenica, his hometown. Police there are not troubled by him, but Chief Inspector Vera is. Chief Inspector Edib Pašić prepares to receive a commendation for solving the Haggadah case, but the ceremony is interrupted by a bomb threat. Edib’s former wife, Tanja, arrives in Sarajevo and gathers her old friends together for a party. Senči also attends, paranoid and fearing the revenge of Smiley's people. In Zenica and in Sarajevo, Edib and Mido confront seemingly simple issues but end up investigating not just their cases but also their personal choices and lives.",
