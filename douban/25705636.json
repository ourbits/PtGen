They arrive at a small town and are lodged by Mr. Hasim who is an old member of the Party of Union and Progress. His daughter Elif is a shy and a melancholy girl. One night, she and Refik meet by the lakeside and a romance between them is kindled. Ahmet also is smitten by Elif. His attraction unrequited, Ahmet remains in the town just to be near her. As the years go by, Elif continues to wait for Refik.",
