    "introduction": "The plot revolves around Lincoln Raider, who is suspected of murdering six young women in a small town. He earned the moniker “The Huntsman” for allegedly leaving the victims’ hearts in decorative boxes alongside poisoned apples. With only one body recovered so far, suspicion weighs heavily on Lincoln. Max Mason, an ICU nurse, volunteers to read to Lincoln while the latter remains in a coma.As the narrative progresses, Max becomes Lincoln’s live-in caregiver upon his awakening despite the objections of the nurse’s sister Darby Albright, the lead detective of the case. But Max may have an ulterior motive for moving in with Lincoln and his beautiful wife Jolene, an accomplished sculptor and mother to their new baby girl Rosy, a motive that may lead to the most shocking revelations yet.",
