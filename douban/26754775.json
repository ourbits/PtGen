    "introduction": "The dangers of LSD are driven home to teenagers in this classroom training film, which is \"narrated\" by an LSD tab. The \"tab\" tells kids that he is \"a depth charge in the mind!\" and various teenagers are shwn babbling about their LSD experiences. \"Experts\" are presented who warn that LSD makes kids \"paint themselves green\" and has various other horrible side effects, the most serious of which is that it gives users a police record, and that there is \"no known way of getting your fingerprints out of a police file once they're in there.\"",
