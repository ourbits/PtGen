    "introduction": "We think we know everything about the emblematic “Frenchie” with his 90 films and 160 million viewers worldwide. However, as through his entire life he alternated among cinéma d’auteur, the new wave of Godard, Chabrol, and Truffaut, and the popular cinema of Verneuil, de Broca, Audiard, and Lautner, Belmondo remains an enigma. This documentary, made with archives, sketches the portrait of an exalted man who had only one obsession: to entertain all his audiences. In movie after movie, Belmondo has fun and gives us a fabulous lesson in life: to know how to enjoy each day and dare everything, playing as he lived, at a thousand miles an hour.",
