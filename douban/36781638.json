    "introduction": "Every Thursday. 9pm. Tom and Evie watch a film together in her garage. Evie lovingly decorates the space to match the film of the week - from a yellow brick road for The Wizard of Oz to a space craft for Alien. It's magical. They’re there for the love of the movies. Or at least, that’s what they tell themselves.In reality, Tom is madly in love with Evie. What he doesn’t know is that Evie is in love with him too. But when Tom accepts a job at the other end of the country, their happily ever after comes under threat. He's leaving in six weeks. That means Evie has six film clubs left to tell Tom how she feels, or risk losing him forever.Evie is going to have to navigate all of this amongst the chaos of her family home – her eccentric and unconventional mother, Suz, and her younger sister Izzy. A trio of women full of love, and dysfunction, in equal measure.A piercingly funny and utterly heart-warming screenwriting debut from two of Britain’s most exciting voices.",
