    "introduction": "Dan has just been released from prison, and Lois is terrified. While he was behind bars, Dan's brother was shot and killed while trying to escape from the police, because Lois had told the police where he was hiding. Everyone whom Lois asks for help knows that Dan holds her responsible, and will not help her. So Dan confronts her in her room alone, prepared to kill her no matter how hard she begs for mercy. Dan is then baffled when Lois tells him to go ahead, since she is in despair and has nothing to live for",
