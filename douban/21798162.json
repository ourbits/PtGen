    "introduction": "Edited film from the 1974 Turkana Conversations film project about the semi-nomadic Turkana camel herding pastoralists living in north-western Kenya. The last in a series of three, this film explores how the Turkana, especially women, view marriage. The film focuses on three sisters and their opinions on a system of polygyny that allows men to marry multiple wives.  While the women talk openly about their lives and why a woman would want her husband to take a second wife, the filmmakers track down the rumours that another wedding is about to take place. By preserving traces of their filmmaking encounters in the final film, the MacDougalls reflexively reveal as much about their own perceptions of the Turkana as they do of the Turkana themselves.",
