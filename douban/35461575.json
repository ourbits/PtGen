    "introduction": "An intimate portrait of legendary, master filmmaker Werner Herzog at work on MY SON, MY SON, WHAT HAVE YE DONE, by that film's co-writer, HERBERT GOLDER, a close friend and long-time collaborator. Unlike other documentaries that have been made about Herzog, in which he stares almost defiantly into the camera and, in his inimitable way and in his famous voice, articulates his views on life, this film shows a side of him known only to his friends and close collaborators. Although refreshingly candid and surprisingly revealing, this portrait in no way diminishes Herzog's mystique -quite the contrary-but it does deepen our appreciation of his humanity, and offers, through Golder's running commentary-as much an ongoing conversation with Herzog himself as a conversation with the viewer-an insider's insight into his craft and an exploration of some of the most abiding and deepest themes of his films.",
