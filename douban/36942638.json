    "introduction": "Released from prison, Ken is met by his younger brother Kinya who tells him of the existence of a long-lost younger sister. Bewildered by this shocking revelation, Ken is persuaded to go along with Kinya, who is set on meeting her, and they immediately start out for Chichibu City where she lives. They pick up a female hitchhiker who has lost her wallet—what will happen now that she has joined them on their journey? The role of Ken is played by director Shuichi Okita, a central figure in contemporary Japanese film. He exudes a warmth in the role that calls to mind his style as a director.刑務所から出所した兄・健は、出迎えられた弟・欽也から生き別れた妹の存在を聞かされる。衝撃的な事実を聞かされた健は困惑するも、妹に会ってみたいと言う欽也に連れられ、二人はその足で妹が住んでいる秩父へと向かう。道中、財布を無くしヒッチハイクをしていた女性を車に乗せ、旅を共にするのだが…。兄・健役は、いまの日本映画界に欠かすことできない存在の沖田修一監督が好演。沖田監督の作風のような、ほのぼのとした味わいを醸し出している。",
