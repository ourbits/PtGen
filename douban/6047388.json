    "introduction": "Rearing roosters, maintaining them and using them for fights are a way of life and a matter of honor and lifeline to many people. In such a tenement, Pettaikaaran (Jayabalan) leads a very respectable life with his key aides Durai (Kishore) and Karuppu (Dhanush) along with others. His main adversary in hen fights is Rathinam, the police inspector. Pettaikaarar is known to have an impeccable track record of successes when it comes to fowl fights especially with Rathinam's. In an unexpected situation, Pettaikaaran challenges Rathinam to a fowl contest which witnesses Karuppu violating his mentor Pettaikaarar's word but emerging successfully with enviable proceeds. This results in the swelling of his status among his folks which plants the seeds of animosity in the minds of Pettaikaaran. What follows is an interesting and unexpected path with twists and turns highlighting on the way the multiple layers of human emotions with sense playing truant.
