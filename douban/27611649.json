    "introduction": "Sylvia Syms explores the BBC archives for a look back at the life and career of one of Britain's best-loved actors, Sir Roger Moore, who died in 2017, just months before his 90th birthday.Interviews with the star from over the years reveal how he went from knitwear model to one of the world's most recognisable faces, thanks to TV shows like The Saint and The Persuaders. They also show how Roger always seemed destined to play James Bond, and how the humour he brought to the franchise and his self-deprecating style guaranteed its success throughout the 1970s and 80s - and made him Britain's greatest cinematic export of the era. We also get the tale of his life post-Bond, which included working as an ambassador for Unicef, a role he judged his most important - putting it even above 007.",
