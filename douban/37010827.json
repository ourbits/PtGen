    "introduction": "Ana was accepted into a renowned dance academy in Europe, so Pablo, her best friend, plans the perfect farewell in her old cabin in the middle of nowhere.Their trip is cut short when Ana, in a fit of drunkenness, decides to send the location of the cabin to her toxic ex-boyfriend.Alex's arrival becomes an ordeal for Pablo, who simply decides to spend the weekend with the couple in reconciliation, while he watches his platonic love fall once again into the clutches of his favorite manipulative narcissist.Pablo decides to leave them on the road to take a truck to the airport and end their suffering, not knowing that what he experienced the previous days was only the beginning of the real hell.That same night, Alex returns to the cabin and tells Pablo that a deadly pandemic has broken out all over the world and that Ana did make her flight, but he did not.After an intense discussion, Pablo gives Alex the opportunity to stay in his car until he can find a place to go. The days pass and Alex begins to secure his days in the cabin, until Pablo allows him to enter.Together, the two enemies begin to do everything they can to survive in an isolated environment without food.Both, having only the car radio to know what is going on in the outside world, realize that they only have each other.The differences between Pablo and Alex slowly begin to become part of the past, until the true demons of each begin to shed their masks.Pablo and Alex will have to be smart, intelligent and above all honest enough to preserve their lives from a threat stronger than the virus itself... their true instincts.",
