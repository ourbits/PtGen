Hoscheck, a former bankmanager has lost his job and his marriage is broken too. In his loneliness he thinks of the better times he once had: vacation at the sea, birthday parties, school and collegetime and his engagement ... under the influence of alcohol and pills Hoscheck loses more and more the ability to see the difference between reality and fantasy.So he gets visited by allegoric figures - such as the Death and the Ghost of the 70s, but he also gets visited by his very real female neighbour he always had a crush on when he was young on years.Heinz Hoscheck's desire is also water: so he pushes himself for the last time to find a job and becomes life guard in a public pool.",
