    "introduction": "The digital debut of a new updated and reedited version of Sirens. An earlier version of the piece was first presented by Metrograph in August. Goldin’s first work made up solely of found-footage video, Sirens was scored by Mica Levi and assembles clips from movies by the likes of Kenneth Anger, Lynne Ramsay, Michelangelo Antonioni, Henri-Georges Clouzot, and Jack Smith, as well as wild documentary footage from the Manson family. “Echoing the enchanting call of the Sirens from Greek mythology, who lured sailors to their untimely deaths on rocky shores, this hypnotic work visually and acoustically entrances the viewer into the ecstasy of being high,” says Goldin. Sirens was inspired by Donyale Luna, the first Black supermodel, who overdosed at the age of 33. This new version is even more euphoric. Donyale’s face looms large.",
