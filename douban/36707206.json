Lucy is an actor about to make her Off-Broadway debut, and Lucien's vying for a solo show at a prestigious art gallery. But when their cousin Matt inexplicably appears, dredging up painful shared history, Lucy and Lucien both struggle to maintain their sanity and sobriety. As their breakout moment arrives, both are forced to grapple with a legacy of childhood trauma, addiction, and loss. They must rely on their chosen family of artists and sex workers to help bring them through.",
