    "introduction": "Two years have passed since series three. Caroline is about to embark on a new headship at a challenging state school which means moving her family out of the beautiful home in Harrogate to a farm house “with potential”. Having agreed to host Christmas Day, Caroline is overwhelmed by so much change. But a chance encounter with a new acquaintance gives her a different perspective. Gillian is racked with guilt over Eddie’s death and is convinced he’s haunting her and Robbie. A séance at Caroline’s new, supposedly haunted, house is enough to tip Gillian over the edge as she makes a life-changing decision. Meanwhile, in a bid to keep her brain active, Celia joins the local amateur dramatics club, encouraging Alan to do the same. But Alan is forced to admit that his memory isn’t what it used to be, leaving the part wide open for Harry, much to Celia’s disdain.",
