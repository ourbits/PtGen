    "introduction": "This British Channel 4 Production (also the source for Queer as Folk) is a hip, action and music filled vision of a multi-racial and pansexual London with oodles of beautiful guys and gals. This amusing, fast-paced series includes all of the staples of a naughty adult soap opera - cheating lovers, fabulous hair and costumes, copious sex and drugs, even an attempted murder.It opens with its enthusiastic cast (all clad in their underwear) singing the show's theme song, \"It's All About Love.\" As the more than two dozen characters play out their lives and loves in this light-hearted romp through London's Notting Hill, audiences will quickly get caught up in the action.The central character is 17-year-old Kwame (Noel Anthony Clarke), a straight boy (\"because somebody has to be\") whose gay dad Max (writer-director-creator Rikki Beadle-Blair) has just broken up with his longtime companion Jordan (Karl Collins). While he tries to get his two dads back together, Kwame also aims to hook up with the beautiful (and perhaps unattainable) Asha (Rebecca Varney). Meanwhile, Kwame's two best friends (both cute and gay), Dean (Paul Keating) and Bambi (Davie Fairbanks), are having their own romantic dramas: Dean has a crush on Max (much to Kwame's dismay), while Bambi is unable to get his older boyfriend Robin (Michael Dotchen) to settle down. Love is not much better for the ladies of Metrosexuality. Max's sister Cindy (Carleen Beadle) is having trouble with her girlfriend Doris (Dee Dee Samuels), who becomes jealous when Cindy's long ago ex-boyfriend re-enters her life. It's easy to see why Metrosexuality is so addictive.",
