    "introduction": "The Taste of Tea explores uncanny AI-generated visuals depicting a body undergoing decay over time, symbolizing the circle of life and the fusion of digital technology with traditional paintings, using AI imagery. The inspiration is drawn from Kusôzu, ‘painting of the nine stages of a decaying corpse’ in Japanese Buddhist paintings. It begins with a depiction of a female body and illustrates the stages of decomposition, ultimately to nature. This was a practice rooted in the aesthetic ideas of impermanence. (源自: Courtisane Festival 2024)",
