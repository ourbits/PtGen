    "introduction": "This documentary film follows the first manned expedition to RMS Titanic in nearly 15 years and captures the wreck for the first time in stunning native 4K. The program follows Caladan Oceanic’s deep-ocean exploration team, led by explorer Victor Vescovo, as they set out to solve some of the wreck’s greatest mysteries. Using the submersible camera systems, the team performed dedicated photogrammetry on the wreck, allowing highly accurate, photo-real 3D models of RMS Titanic to be produced. The 2019 expedition received world-wide news coverage last year when the initial results of the dives were announced.",
