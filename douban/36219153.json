    "introduction": "A young girl (Lou Deleuze) accompanies her nail beautician mother to meet new clients in an imposingly large home. There, she meets three girls who bring her away from the adults to play a uniquely cruel board game downstairs. Joséphine Darcy Hopkins’ third work to bless the Fantasia screen, following THE DAY MY MOTHER BECAME A MONSTER (2017) and CLOUD (2020), SWEET TOOTH pieces perfectly into her gripping, character-driven oeuvre of genre storytelling, with startling performances, potent allegorical weight and moments of shock that will freeze you.源自：https://fantasiafestival.com/en/film/sweet-tooth",
