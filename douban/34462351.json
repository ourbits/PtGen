    "introduction": "Tito (played by director Grace Glowicki in an unrecognisible transformation) is a young man ruled by fear and paranoia, unkempt and constantly terrified that the predators who have plagued his life might get him. One day Tito is shocked to discover a neighbour intruding into his home. The neighbour befriends Tito, but he never seems to leave. With her debut feature, Glowicki has skilfully crafted a study of predatory abuse and fear, flipping them back to the masculine psyche from where they have originated, and presenting a film which is often hilarious, but just as often harrowing.",
