    "introduction": "Petr Vok (Martin Ruzek) changes entirely after the death of his wife Katerina, although in fact he has not been particularly fond of her. He is uninterested in women, and is often gloomy and silent. Vok also resists the amorous snares of the Countess of Montfort (Iva Janzurová), who would like to take Katerina's place. His friends and family try to distract the noble lord, but without success. Neither graceful young girls nor the sight of his court full of his illegitimate children cheers him up. Vok receives a visit from the Archduke Matyás, who wants to persuade him to join a conspiracy against the Emperor Rudolf (Zdenek Rehor). Vok refuses, and on the contrary saves Rudolf from his enemies in his steam coach.",
