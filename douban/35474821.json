    "introduction": "Filmed in front of a live audience on tour in Australia, Dylan Moran’s DR COSMOS offers his unique take on love, politics, misery and the everyday absurdities of life, all served with his trademark poetical panache. Dylan Moran has been called the Oscar Wilde of comedy and his famed style – deadpan, witty and with crackpot lyricism – makes for an unmissable journey through his interpretations of the world, swerving cliché to offer a cutting blow to our idiosyncrasies.",
