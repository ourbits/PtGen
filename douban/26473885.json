    "introduction": "In a forest town, Anton is ridiculed and bullied by most other kids as a nerdy Scaredy Cat. Hunter Joseph isn't inclined either to believe his claim of sighting the first wold in a century, but still digs a trap just in case. He has two admirers, the mayor's snob wife and her seamstress Annemarie, whose impish daughter Little red Riding Hood is Anton's friend and the pride of Annemarie's weird but inventive mother, who lives alone in the forest. When the girl is sent to bring her sick granny provisions, a pack-evicted old wolf is roaming for easy prey, like humans, and craftily manages to eat each in one piece. Anton and Joseph however patrol the woods, and take on the voracious predator.",
