    "introduction": "A poor girl is lured into a world of crime and haunted by the ghosts of her guilt and conscience. Experimental by nature, To Caterpillar from Butterfly follows traditional film grammar to reflect real life in all its absurd societal norms—only to subvert its own rules as the society it represents collapses. As the picture unfolds, the focus begins to blur, the screen is split into multiple windows, the sound goes off-sync and the dimensions of images change. Eventually, the film and real worlds merge and (faced with the constrictions of the Coronavirus pandemic) the filmmakers set the remainder of their work inside a single room.",
