    "introduction": "In July 1995, the world's first UN Safe Area became the site of Europe's worst massacre since World War II. That month, the Bosnian Serb army staged a brutal takeover of the village of Srebrenica and its surrounding region, while a Dutch peacekeeping battalion of United Nations forces helplessly looked on.In the course of the destruction, Bosnian Serb soldiers separated Muslim families and systematically slaughtered more than 7,000 Muslim men in the fields and factories around the town.As investigators continue to exhume the bodies from mass graves and the details of the tragedy continue to unfold, the killings lead us to urgent, fundamental questions. How can genocide occur in Europe in this day and age, despite the presence of multiple diplomatic agencies intended to prevent such barbarity?",
