    "introduction": "The documentary presents a lesser known, yet very important scene of the retribution that followed the 1956 revolution and fight for independence, the Kisfogház (Small Prison) through the reminiscences of the one-time victims. People sentenced to death for political reasons were executed in the courtyard of the prison. Three of the protagonists of this documentary escaped death by hanging in the last minute, however, many other prisoners were murdered. The film offers a shocking portrait of the impossibility of processing this trauma and the survivors' incessant compulsion for remembrance.",
