    "introduction": "Billie Holiday is one of the most phenomenal and tragic jazz vocalists of all time. The Philadelphia-born star's life was wrought with personal turmoil and numbed (and ultimately destroyed) by drug dependency. Jazz aficionados and novices alike are given an opportunity to see and hear the legendary jazz singer through rare TV and movie footage, commentary from fellow instrumentalists and singers, and narration from Holiday's autobiography, \"Lady Sings the Blues,\" as read by stage and screen star Ruby Dee.",
