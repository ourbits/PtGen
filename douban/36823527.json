    "introduction": "Phonograph is a short feature film by Kirill Serebrennikov, shot in 2016. The film shows an episode from the life of Pyotr Tchaikovsky and his entourage that occurred in January 1890, when recording enthusiast Julius Blok brought Edison's phonograph to Russia and offered to record Anton Rubinstein's playing on the phonograph. Rubinstein refused to play, and as a result, Tchaikovsky and several musicians participated in the recording, mainly with joking phrases. The recording itself, lasting just over one minute, was considered lost for a long time, but in 1997 it was discovered in the Pushkin House; It is the only surviving recording with Tchaikovsky's voice.",
