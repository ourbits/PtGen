    "introduction": "In a quiet seaside village, Xiao Kui, a lively girl with many dreams, is just as eager to help her mother Hongjv with her Maoqiang opera performances as she is to play with her friends. Since Xiao Kui’s father never returned from the sea, Hongjv has shouldered the burden of supporting the family alone. Her most shining moments are when she steps on stage as an opera actor. But now, with few people interested in traditional opera and Xiao Kui falling ill, their lives are suddenly swept into a turbulent current. While the film depicts unavoidable moments of pain and loss, its true theme is resilience—how we bounce back from such moments. Much like the balloons fluttering around the village, wishing for the safe return of those who went to sea, pain is ever-present in their lives, but so are the warm wishes for each other’s well-being. Blue Sea is a heartwarming film brimming with such kindness.",
