    "introduction": "In this end of year review show, Rob Rinder casts an unflinching eye, razor sharp legal mind and acerbic tongue over the events of 2018 to judge once and for all whether the year will be chalked up as being a 'good' or 'bad' one. With the help of celebrity guests, Rob will delve deep into all the news stories, people and talking points of the year.Uncompromising, perceptive and funny, Rob will make us all reconsider what we previously thought about 2018 with a fresh take on the big issues while also bringing us the hilarious tiny details we've already forgotten in our post-Christmas booze haze.",
