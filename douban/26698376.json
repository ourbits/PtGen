Home movies shot during the 1970s, at their center is a lovely young blond-haired girl, Larisa. Teaming up with a photographer friend, Pardo decides to track down Larisa. ---From MUBIDrawn from more than 2,000 feet of Super-8 film home movies shot between 1970 and 1980, purchased at a Mexican flea market 30 years later by director Andres Pardo. In screening the reels, he finds episodes of the childhood of the charming and expressive Larisa filmed by her father, and stumbles onto the story of a family that somehow becomes disconnected from its memories. The filmmaker teams up with photographer Santiago Cassarino to create a documentary that searches for answers and ultimately, Larisa. ---From IMDB",
