    "introduction": "If it's true that we are what we eat, then we are having an identity crisis. These days, food's journey from farm to plate is a strange one. And the distance that separates the fare on our tables from living beings has wiped out the traditional connection between the eater and the eaten. The old women has a simple relationship with her animals – she raises them, loves them, kills them and eats them. When she goes to town, her goat becomes an object of curiosity. The townspeople are disconcerted by the unexpected presence of this goat in their midst, then find themselves won over by the animal's charming tricks. For the old women, however, the goat is both companion and livelihood. The urbanites, once fascinated, are ultimately repulsed by such intimacy with their food.  10 mins",
