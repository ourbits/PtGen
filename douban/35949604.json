The only clue is a strange partial letter found on him that warns of grave danger. Melchior’s attempts to understand the circumstances of the young man’s memory loss lead him to uncover a hidden dead body. The partial letter gives Melchior an idea how to lure the killer into a trap... but this time the danger comes too close to home.",
