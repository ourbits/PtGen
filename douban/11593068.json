    "introduction": "Antonio is only eleven when he wins a scholarship and leaves his house in a little village in the Madonie Mountains to study at the Convitto Nazionale “Giovanni Falcone” school in Palermo. But Antonio suffers from homesickness and becomes listless and stand-offi sh. His teacher Mr Carella tries in vain to involve him in working on the school paper which is preparing its commemoration of the anniversary of the Capaci attack. During the school year a football tournament is organised and Antonio decides to fix the deciding match, blackmailing his friend Salvatore, who is going to be the referee. However, doubts and remorse torment him – he is “one of the Falcone schoolboys” as his teacher is constantly reminding him. How can he commit an illegal action on the exact same spot where the judge assassinated by the mafia went to primary school?",
