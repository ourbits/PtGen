Their development of cloning technology replaced many workers with replicants, including the police.

Kinder, a mega-fan of the show and avid hologamer, has won the \"Be A Baddie\" contest and is placed undercover with the criminals. However when he develops feelings for Cipher, the gang's computer hacker, Kinder decides to help them escape certain death using his obsessive knowledge of the show.",
