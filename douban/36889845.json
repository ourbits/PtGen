    "introduction": "Concerts in the woods, at the church, on the rock and at the train station – Time in Jazz festival is inherently linked to the place where it has been organised since 1988. The town of Berchidda in Sardinia offers beautiful natural surroundings as a background to absorb a variety of music traditions ranging from jazz improvisation through world music to Nino Rota’s compositions performed in the streets. Combining contemporary footage with archival materials, the film provides a portrayal of this atmospheric event. Above all, it is made by people, i.e. the festival artists and its faithful audience, organisers and local residents.",
