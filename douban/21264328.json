    "introduction": "The third Series has been filmed and started on Thursday 8 April 2010 at 9:30pm – 10:00pm on BBC One.[7][8] Series 3 introduces Pete's mother Sandra, who has a gambling problem, in the first two episodes. Another new recurring character throughout the series is Kelly (Anna Skellern), a young woman who lives nearby on whom Jake has a crush. Auntie Angela also returns for one episode. Granddad, Barbara and Jo all fail to make reappearances, and the same can be said for recurring character Jane (who has previously appeared in one episode of each series and the Christmas special), however, she was mentioned discreetly in episode 2 when Jake says \"Jane\" is on the phone, and has to tell Pete \"not annoying Jane\" before he would take the call. This series averaged 4.99 million viewers. The series finale aired on 20 May 2010.",
