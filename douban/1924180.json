    "introduction": "From the Back Cover1421: Year China Discovered America? Presents a startling journey of adventure and exploration that could turn the conventional view of world history on its head. This fascinating documentary examines the mystery surrounding the sailing exploits of the legendary Admiral Zhen He and his 30 year command of a gigantic Ming fleet. The Chinese court burned all records of Admiral Zhen He's daring voyages and achievements, and unwittingly created a mystery that tantalizes the world 500 years later.-------------------Product DescriptionThis special examines the theories outlined by Gavin Menzies in his best-selling book. An amateur historian and former submarine commander in the British Navy, Menzies poses an argument that could change the way we perceive global history forever -- that Chinese admirals discovered America and Chinese junks first circled the earth. Traveling across the continent, the film combines history, science and technology with adventure and exploration.",
