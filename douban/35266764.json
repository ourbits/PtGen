    "introduction": "Wildlife gets busy in the long, warm days of spring. Millions of shorebirds set off on incredible journeys that will take them to the top of the planet. In New Jersey, they cross paths with the horseshoe crabs that spawn on the beach, gifting the birds with fuel for their trip north. In the Hawaiian Islands, goby fish climb a colossal waterfall--an Everest-sized feat for the tiny fish. In Alaska, a sea otter must leave her helpless pup to fish. In Minnesota, a massive boar threatens a family of black bear cubs. In the Wisconsin woodlands, ducklings face a perilous leap to reach their home pond. It’s a wild ride in the American spring.",
