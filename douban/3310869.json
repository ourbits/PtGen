    "introduction": "UPAL / HEAT, which Kutz made in 1964 as a sequel to the \"Kabaret Starszych Panow\" / \"Old Gentleman's Cabaret,\" is practically a cult film today. At the time of its release, it met with strongly differing reactions. Some valued it for its surrealistic sense of humor, air of the grotesque and outright absurdity, while others criticized it for lacking cogency, calling it incoherent and an unfortunate coincidence in the director's career.Based on the old Polish variety theater, Kabaret Starszych Panow, or \"Old Gentlemen's Cabaret,\" this cult comedy classic is renowned for its slapstick gags and absurd humor. Two entertainers in top hats and tails wreak havoc around town as they search for a venue to showcase their \"talents.\" The loose structure is an excuse for assembling a collection of old-style comedy sketches, songs, and jokes from the Polish cabaret scene of bygone years. Heat is a departure for Kazimierz Kutz, a renowned director of serious dramas who began his long career as part of the Polish School of the 1950s.If you crossed \"A Hard Day's Night\" with Monty Python and Polish variety shows, you'd get something along the lines of this exercise in slapstick and absurdity from Poland. The comic exploits of two well-dressed gentlemen cavorting about town in their top hats and tails forms the loosey-goosey backbone of this film packed with gags, songs, and sketches in the cabaret style. Jerzy Bielenia, Wieslaw Golas star. 82 min.",
