    "introduction": "The Broken and the Bad is a short-form documentary web series inspired by the most memorable characters, situations and themes of the Better Call Saul and Breaking Bad universe. Hosted by Giancarlo Esposito (who played Gus Fring on the shows), all six episodes will become available on July 9, 2020 on AMC's digital platforms in the United States, coinciding with a week of special Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul programming.The series will connect with the shows by showing real life scenarios that relate to their fictional characters and events, introducing viewers into topics such as the psychology of con artists and hit men, and the economics of massive drug operations. One episode, for instance, has the appearance of a town in America where those with electromagnetic hypersensitivity — like Better Call Saul's Chuck McGill — can live in peace.",
