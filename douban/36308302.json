    "introduction": "Bound is a parable on the laws of art, based on Ilse Aichinger’s short story Der Gefesselte. A man wakes up. He is bound. The bonds leave him room to move. He performs in a circus. A woman tries to match his movements in the bonds; she fails to seduce him. The bound man finds a wolf in the forest. In his bonds he is equivalent to the wolf. He brings him to the circus. They perform in the circus. The woman cuts the bonds. The wolf almost kills the man. The woman shoots the wolf. The man goes away.",
