    "introduction": "This is a story of lifetime. A story full of spiritual power biography, behind which stays a whole age in the national development of Bulgaria.Reality & Fantasy, 6 May 2006Author: lordsin from BulgariaThis is one of the best movies I've seen. Some may say it has no sense, but if you look closely you'll notice that this movie is a philosophical masterpiece. It shows several scenes of life in the village and then the brilliant Rangel Vulchanov puts reality into a boy's fantasies. The movie jumps from birth to death, from wedding to funeral, from joy to sorrow, from reality to fantasy, from war to peace. There are lots of laughable moments for the comedy fans, and there's drama for the drama fans. You won't forget this movie once you've seen it. It's a true gem! It will give you all you want even more...One of the best Bulgarian movies ever made. Better than all of the French movies altogether!",
