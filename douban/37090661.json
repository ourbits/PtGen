    "introduction": "In \"Gerhard Richter: 4 Decades\" Curator Robert Storr takes us through the artist's 2002 MoMA retrospective room by room, accompanied by the artist himself. The haunting and diverse collection features 188 of Richter's signature blurred photo-realistic paintings. From the political struggles of Western Germany to portraits of loved ones, Richter's body of work evokes a sense of both familiarity and dread. Storr and Richter's discussion of the artist's motivation and vision results in a deeply honest reflection on the retrospective as well as Richter's career as \"Europe's greatest modern painter\".",
