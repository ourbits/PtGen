    "introduction": "\"The Fassbinder Story\" narrates the fast and furious life of the German writer-producer-director and, above all, artist Rainer Werner Fassbinder, a life which had all the dynamics of a Hollywood blockbuster. A man who paid the price for a career shaped by ceaseless work and world fame. After his death in 1982, aged only 37, Fassbinder came to leave a total of 44 self-directed films, including two multi-part TV series. The chronological connection between his films, whenever showing autobiographical references to his life, sketches the madness of his being, uniting it with rare footage from film sets and previously undisclosed video and audio recordings into one composite whole.",
