    "introduction": "In the spring of 2005, an old mother living in Hanoi receives a diary. The diary carries the notes of a young woman doctor who worked at a national liberation front hospital for two years starting in 1968 until her death. The diary was first discovered by a US military officer, who kept it for 35 years. The diary was then published in Vietnam and caused a sensation. The long moving journey linking Vietnam with the US is depicted through a true story adapted by Dan Nyat Minh, one of Vietnam's top film directors. Written by Fukuoka International Film Festival",
