Their only purpose is to live in the present while battling the fear of being forgotten. Meanwhile, a woman facing an imminent loss of memory, tries to deliver a secret, asking for forgiveness for the guilt she has carried her whole life.Colonia Dignidad closed a long time ago and the enslaved children that grew up there are now adults. What do you do after such a deep trauma?Memory, wounds, redemption, scars, fiction, and reality are all different layers of the fascinating Russian doll which is this movie, an engaging and captivating jigsaw that will move you. One thing is certain, Matias Rojas’s skilful eye turns past traumas into enthralling films.Javier Garcia Puerto源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/winter-howl/",
