    "introduction": "VRIn a highly fictionalized and stylized approach, The Fury explores sexual exploitation of female political prisoners, referencing the Islamic Republic of Iran’s brutal treatment of political prisoners. We follow the psychological and emotional state of a woman who remains haunted by memories of sexual assault, torture and rape in prison. Throughout the entrancing and loosely tied narrative, Neshat poignantly addresses the issue of the female body as both an object of desire and violence. The Fury is an exhibition by acclaimed Iranian artist Shirin Neshat that consists of a two-channel video installation and a never before seen 360 video.",
