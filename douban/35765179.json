I would always draw manga by myself at school, but then someone started to follow me. “Am I being stalked?!” To run away from them, I hid in a random car trunk. “Okay, they can’t find me here.” But as soon as I thought of that, the trunk closed, and I got locked in. My phone was dead too. What do I do?!",
