    "introduction": "The story is simple, but effective: The Sheriff's wife has given birth, but to Siamese twins! And that’s happens during a lunar eclipse (beautifully represented with a hole in a piece of cardboard!).The poor creature has been chained, hidden in a basement. Any giving day the Sheriff has said “this seems like a good day to unlink the kids”, so he forced a doctor to make a dangerous surgery, in an old shack, they took no preparation at all, merely a bottle of chloroform, knife and fork! Well, the separation of the creature has bizarre and dying consequences.",
