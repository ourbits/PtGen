    "introduction": "Sol and Pedro have just finished school. Between their talks and walks, Sol practices piano –as she has since childhood– and Pedro shyly approaches writing. During those languid days when –perhaps for the very last time– there is not much to do other than hang out and think of the things to come, one gets the feeling that those passions that move them, sometimes in the dark, may start to become a path and a profession. In her first solo effort, Malena Solarz builds a small universe inhabited by characters that are at once unique and recognizable; she closely follows her protagonists and invites us to look into the small everyday gestures to discover how a possible future begins to take shape. Album for the Youth takes place at a very precise and unrepeatable moment in life: a suspended time, a parenthesis in which we can start to glimpse a new path and all that we’re capable of becoming appears at a distance.",
