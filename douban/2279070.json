    "introduction": "以色列人也能拍出好的超现实电影...真的.Mulli is on a journey through a surreal middle east, in order to retrieve his stolen backpack. On his way he's haunted by a song, that seems to constantly follow him. He discovers a strange place called planet blue. He's given a drug that resembles an onion bulb, which is supposed to be the ultimate high. After he meets an assortment of offbeat characters he heads to the dead sea. \"Planet Blue\" took me by surprise, I have never seen any Israili films before this one. I really didn't know what to expect from a film that's labeled a \"Hebrew stoner comedy\". I enjoyed \"Planet Blue\" because it had a style of its own that was completely original. The film is kind of like what might happen if director Richard Linklater got stoned at a Bar-Mitzvah and moved to Israel. This film is quite a cult sensation in Isreal. If you can find a copy, you won't be disappointed. Director Gur Bentvitch went on to direct \"Total Love\", a bizarre romantic stoner comedy about a love potion. So, if your looking for something strange and new \"Planet Blue\" is a film for you.",
