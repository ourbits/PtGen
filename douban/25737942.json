    "introduction": "“At the height of his creative output, director Joe Sarno was known for flinging out an ungodly number of softcore films each year with a surprisingly high standard of quality. Psychological insight, intensely erotic love scenes, and off-kilter dialogue were his stock in trade with films like All the Sins of Sodom and Young Playthings, but sandwiched in between these are some really oddball ones. Case in point: Marcy, a 1968 hayseed melodrama that feels like a stylistic precursor to the country cutie smut films of Harry Novak the following decade like Sassy Sue and Country Cuzzins, albeit with a lot less of that cornpone humor. The plot also feels like sort of a deep-fried riff on D.H. Lawrence’s The Fox, believe it or not, which Norman J. Warren also turned into a sex/sci-fi trash classic with Prey.The plot’s pretty simple. Out in the boonies, young Marcy (Love Toy’s Uta Erickson) has shacked up with the older June (Submission’s Britt), and word spreads like wildfire that the two women are enjoying each other’s company in a way that keeps �em really, really warm at night. Their handyman insists he hasn’t seen the women actually having sex, but they do tend to “rassle around on the ground outside” before retiring to their bedrooms. Hmmm. Muddying the waters even more, the local men all seem intent on bedding both of them to prove that it only takes the right man to make a girl swing, and the advances aren’t always refused. Of course, it’s only a matter of time before we find out what’s really going on as one of Sarno’s trademark girl-on-girl scenarios finally plays out for the camera.",
