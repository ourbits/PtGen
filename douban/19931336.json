    "introduction": "Jin-kyu loses his pension in a public toilet which he prepared for his son’s operation. He happened to find and accuse Myong-ja, the Chinese janitor who was there at the time, but failed to find the envelope. Jin-kyu keeps following Myong-ja out of suspicion he couldn’t get rid of; but loses his son eventually. Appearing with different meanings in the film, ‘suffocation’ is virtually the keyword with which the director summarizes the Korean society.",
