    "introduction": "Meet Romy Scott (Kristin Booth), a woman who has developed some phobias because of traumatic events in childhood and adolescence. She's afraid of the storm, getting outside, kissing, lobsters and opening boxes. As a result of that, she's never left her apartment since she was 24 years old. In order to pay her bills, this woman from Toronto works in her apartment as a self-employed travel agent. Moreover, Romy seeks the help of either of her neighbours - Erin (Shauna MacDonald) and Bessie (Rosemary Dunsmore) - to perform tasks like opening boxes for her.However, at some point in her life, Bessie passes away and Erin has less time on her hands for Romy. This is why Romy feels blocked in her life. Then comes Guy (Aaron Abrams), Bessie's son and Romy's new neighbour. As they begin to know each other, Guy will try to fulfill the impossible mission: make Romy conquer her phobias one by one. Nevertheless, can Romy really love Guy (and kiss him), a man who likes to go outside and travel?",
