    "introduction": "Kehri Singh is a poor farmer, who buries his new born girl child while she was still alive, because he believes that girls bring nothing but misfortune. However, the birth of two sons isn’t enough to change his fortunes for the better. Desperate, he turns to a traveling godman who tells him that the only way out for him is to adopt a girl child. A baby girl is brought home, whom he names Preet (meaning love), and assuredly, Kehri Singh’s fortunes turn. From being a nobody, he becomes the feared face of modern Gurgaon. Nikki Singh, his eldest son finds himself openly rejected, humiliated and constantly sidelined by his own father. In Gurgaon, the eldest son is guaranteed a seat at his father’s favored table, yet he finds Preet occupying that very place. Nikki uses the debt he owes to a local bookie as an excuse to set off a chilling chain of events that unwittingly force his cold-blooded father to confront his buried past.",
