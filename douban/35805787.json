    "introduction": "\"Whose Children Are They?\" is the groundbreaking and powerfully persuasive documentary featuring empowered parents, brave teachers, and front-line education experts who pull back the curtain about what is truly happening in our public schools today. This film is the starting point for a full cultural conversation about the need to return to the original intent of education, not indoctrination. \"Whose Children Are They?\" will inform and equip parents, teachers, grandparents and concerned citizens, to partner together for the innocence and well-being of our children. It will also educate all education stakeholders on the corrupting influence of teachers' unions, and the vital importance of removing them from our schools.—WCAT Production Team",
