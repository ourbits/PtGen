    "introduction": "The film tells the life of the ladies' tailor Wilhelm Weitling, one of the central spokespersons of German socialism in the first half of the 19th century, in the form of an acted documentary. Weitling was born in Magdeburg in 1808, worked as a communist agitator in Switzerland and Paris and was arrested in Zurich in 1843 and extradited to Prussia a year later. When the Prussian government refused to allow him to stay, he went to London, then to Brussels and finally emigrated to America after a major dispute with Marx and Engels. The film depicts the years leading up to Weitling's emigration to the USA. Uschi Reich relies on Weitling's original sources and on court records that have been preserved. These sources dominate the text version of the film. In the images, she attempts to reconstruct the time period.",
