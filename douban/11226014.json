    "introduction": "Tango Feroz: la leyenda de Tanguito (Spanish: Wild tango: the legend of Tanguito) is a 1993 Argentine movie blockbuster, freely based in the life of Tanguito, one of the first artists of Argentine rock (\"Tanguito\" is just a stage name, nor the artist or the movie are related with Tango music). Fernan Mirás and Cecilia Dopazo, unknown by the main public by that point, had the lead roles and became famous after the movie, directed by Marcelo Piñeyro. It was the most successful movie in Argentina at the year of its release.The movie deals with Tanguito's drug addiction, his love for Mariana, his friendship with Mauricio \"Moris\" Birabent, his madness and death.The movie does not include any of the songs written by the real Tanguito, such as La Balsa, as Piñeyro could not acquire the rights for doing so. In turn, it uses many other old songs of Argentine Rock. Ulises Butrón sang the hit \"El amor es más fuerte\" (Spanish: Love is stronger), in the scenes played by Mirás as the singer.",
