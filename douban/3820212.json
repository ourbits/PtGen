    "introduction": "This stunning and dangerous limited series spotlights both the controversial Japanese whaling trade and the tactics that the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society and its staff and volunteers use to cripple it. Aboard the Motor Yacht \"Steve Irwin\" the group seeks out the Japanese whaling fleet and then uses it's Delta Zodiac, helicopter, and other innovative techniques to enforce the law, including close-quarters ship-to-ship contact, to disable and/or sink the Japanese whaling ships in the fight to enforce international laws on the high seas where law enforcement is minimal or non-existent. The successful confrontations disrupt whale carcass processing and disperse the fleet of whaling vessels.",
