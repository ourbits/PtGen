    "introduction": "First broadcast on the UK’s Channel 4 in March 1988 this was episode 10 (of 11) of the series The Modern World, Ten Great Writers.It mixes documentary and interview with a part dramatisation of The Trial starring the still relatively unknown Tim Roth (he is fourth in the credits listing on Amazon). The voiceover is by the ever so serious but still rather good Melvyn Bragg and there are comments from the even more serious George Steiner who at one point makes the salient comment that Kafka is the only writer (or person?) ever to be identified by just an initial.The picture quality is not great but given the nature of the piece and its rarity that is not a great drawback. Please add to the Franz Kafka Collection.As ever, given its rarity, this piece is for the benefit of the members of this wonderful site and not for other sites and especially not for any public sites. If any member should see any of my uploads on a public site please let me know and I will kill, and then reload, the links.",
