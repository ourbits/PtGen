    "introduction": "Ambulances: Life And Death On The Streets (3 x 60′) – Observational documentary, which gives an exclusive insight into how London’s Ambulance service – that was last year put into special measures – deals with this ever-growing city and its health extremes.London is one of the most diverse and economically polarised cities in the world. The city is getting bigger, richer, poorer, unhealthier and older – all at the same time – and The London Ambulance Service is at the front line of these inequalities, and operates around the clock in one of the most challenging working environments in the world.Each episode provides a complete 360° look at the movements of the ambulances pulsing through the city, and unique access to the ambulance control centre, who wrestle with the complex logistics required to make sure they are dispatched in the shortest time possible and the most urgent cases are prioritised to save lives.Every call and call-out will be logged and analysed – with cameras capturing the dramatic shifts of paramedics and call handlers on the front line of emergency care. Using cutting-edge graphics, the data will be used to illustrate the wide-ranging challenges the service handles every day, and to create a heat map of London’s health issues.And behind the data, the series will meet the people who are working day in and day out, from paramedics to 999 call operators, to keep on top of the pressure and provide emergency care to Londoners across the capital.",
