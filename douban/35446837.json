He has a special ability: whenever he closes his eyes, he is able to see through the eyes of lost children and thus helps to find them. His work is his life, which he shares only with the old lady Aunt Mituk. However, everything changes when he makes a mistake and connects to the sight of an adult woman, Vera. Thanks to her, he begins to see the world differently and a special relationship begins to develop between them. They are getting closer and closer, but this unusual harmony cannot be maintained forever.",
