    "introduction": "夏天快结束了，树上的果实渐渐成熟了。爷爷给孙子一只风筝。当男孩被抛向空中时，爷爷抓住了他。然后树叶落了，爷爷变得虚弱了。一股强劲的秋风把他带到多云的天空。冬天来了，然后是春天。一阵温暖的微风又把他们聚集在一起了。这个故事讲述的是迷人的，丰富的纹理图像，是关于记住那些不再与我们在一起的人。Summer is coming to an end, the fruit is growing ripe on the trees. Grandpa gives his Grandson a kite. As the boy is tossed around in the air, Grandpa catches him. Then the leaves fall and Grandpa has grown weak. A strong autumn wind carries him off into the cloudy sky. Winter comes, then springtime. A warm breeze brings them together again. Told with enchanting, richly-textured images, this tale is about remembering those who are no longer with us.Summer is coming to an end, the fruit is growing ripe on the trees.
