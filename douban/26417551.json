    "introduction": "Film adaptation of acclaimed play, directed by one of the most exciting names in Polish contemporary theater. The main protagonists represent three generations of women living together below the minimum social level in a cramped Warsaw bedsitter, are: wheelchair-bound grandma, her daughter and granddaughter - little metal girl. The panorama of characters is complemented by their neighbors: a leaflet distributor and a highbrow director of the film 'Horse that rode horseback'. As well as, two actors, a TV presenter and a girl who wants to rescue all kinds of 'poor' people. A story full of grotesque dialogues comprised of perversely taken pop-culture quotes, mockery of the language of publicity and national stereotypes. All this, treating of post 1989 Polish society.",
