She is asked to collaborate with Uzi Silver (Rami Hoiberger), a revered former director, who has turned to religion and become a rabbi...and who now wants to make his comeback film - an adaptation of the biblical tragedy of King Saul. But working with Silver feels more like a war than a film production, and Sharon gets caught up in a whirlwind that threatens to destroy her mentally and financially, and endangers her relationships with those she holds dearest.",
