A deal with him soon brings her a little girl, who is looked after by young Št pán, the son of the Queen's chamber-maid. Št pán and the princess gradually fall in love with each other. When it is revealed that the contract stipulates that the princess is to become Lucifer's bride on her eighteenth birthday, the king holds a ball at which Št pánka is to be betrothed to a prince from another country and thus escape her fate... Lucifer, sees through the plan and turns Št pánka into a black specter.
