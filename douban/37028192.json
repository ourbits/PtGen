    "introduction": "Lydda Airport takes place at the eponymous location sometime in the mid to late 1930’s - the period in which the airport was under construction but also functioning. Built in 1936 by the British, Lydda Airport was an important stop along the “Empire Route” for their national airline, Imperial Airways. Until 1939 it was the world’s largest aerodrome. Central to the film’s narrative is Hannibal, one of eight planes which made up the Handley Page fleet; the largest passenger planes in the world at that time. Hannibal mysteriously disappeared in 1940 somewhere over the Gulf of Oman en route to Sharjah.",
