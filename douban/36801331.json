    "introduction": "The “Bossales” were the African slaves who won the Haitian war of independence. This term now qualifies as a rebellious person, like the protagonists of the film. Charlotte, a human rights defender, Foukifoura, a satirical columnist, Edris, a filmmaker of the insurrection, Michou, a worker struggling to survive, Ramoncite, an enigmatic voodoo priest. In the nowadays explosive social situation, they all embody the soul of their rebellious country: an incandescent home of political and spiritual resistance. (源自: TIDF)",
