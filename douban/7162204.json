    "introduction": "A legendary Scottish filmmaker who has made only one feature and three shorts from 1972 to 1991, Bill Douglas has nevertheless drawn praise from such noted directors as François Truffaut and Satyajit Ray. In 1972, Douglas won the Best First Film award at the Venice Film Festival for his affecting documentary My Childhood, yet in the years that followed, his work would become sporadic at best. While his 1987 film Comrades earned Douglas The Independent's Film of the Year award, it was also his last film to date. In this documentary, director Andy Kimpton-Nye explores the life of a filmmaker who rose from abject poverty to become one of the most unique storytellers in the world of cinema",
