Ryan is the lighting technician for his school’s play Romeo and Juliet, directed by his dad Philip, but struggles to keep his eye on the ball as he’s hopelessly in love with the play’s lead, Jasmine.As the story progresses, and to Ryan’s surprise, one night, the ghost of Shakespeare himself appears in his room and offers to teach him the role of Romeo so he can star alongside Jasmine in the play. Initially hesitant, Ryan slowly comes around to the idea and auditions for the play with Shakespeare by his side. But with Jasmine’s older friend Billy hanging around and her other potential Romeos getting in the way, how will Ryan ever capture Jasmine’s heart?",
