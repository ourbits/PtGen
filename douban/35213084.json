    "introduction": "Elin is a donor child, growing up with two mothers, and zero contact with her biological father. After turning eighteen, Elin is finally given the opportunity to meet him. At the F.A.R clinic they specialize at facilitating the first meeting between donor-father and child, sending them through customized therapy exercises to make up for lost time and thus give the relationship a kick-start. For Elin however, the first meeting with her unknown father proves to be more complex than she had ever imagined. \"Papapa\" is a humorous story about emotions and expectations, and how these do not always live up to each other",
