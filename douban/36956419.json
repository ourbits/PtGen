    "introduction": "The director of the unforgettable Big Phat Party once again proves her ability to find poetry where others see only the mundane metropolis. A girl breaks up with her boyfriend, and her neighbor's cherished dog passes away. While some might dismiss these events as unrelated, they'd be mistaken. Kinga Pudełek has crafted a film that's melancholic, amusing, and piercingly moving, weaving together two profound themes. The bad news? Grief is an inescapable part of life. The good news? Sometimes, out of the blue, we meet someone wise who guides us through it.",
