    "introduction": "\"Sensualidad\" is another masterpiece of Mexican melodrama. It tells the story of a caberetera, Aurora (Niñon Sevilla), that is sentenced to two years and ... one day (!) in jail on account of theft. The judge, Alejandro (Fernado Soler), that sentences her is a model of integrity and leads an exemplary life: 30 years of happy married life - a dedicated wife and a dedicated son.After having served her time in jail, Aurora returns to her \"seedy\" life. One night by chance Aurora meets Alejandro. She will succeed in seducing him - at first Alejandro is troubled and perplexed, but it will be no use fighting - he will fall completely in love with her. And then she will take revenge. The Pandora's Box is open now, only Alejandro still doesn't know it... Aurora's revenge will take catastrophic dimensions (as it is to be expected in a good Mexican melodrama) and raise havoc all around. But as the saying goes, play with fire and you may get burned.Sensualidad, like other caberetera films, mixes drama with musical numbers. Alberto Gout (Aventurera) directed it. \"Sensualidad\" is not so sublimely comic as \"Aventurera\", but it has the same style. Niñon Sevilla gives an outstanding and over-the-top performance as the unscrupulous seductress who stops at nothing to achieve her aims. Her facial expressions, her bulging (when in fear) or ironic eyes, her movements and especially her seduction scenes make \"Sensualidad\" a must.Some actors that worked with her in \"Aventurera\" are also present - Andrea Palma, as the judge's suffering and faithful wife, and Ruben Rojo, as the judge's noble and faithful son. Rodolfo Acosta, a cruel pimp in \"Victimas del Pecado\" plays a …… heartless pimp in \"Sensualidad\". The story is deliciously campy but it can be moving as well (according to your reading).The musical numbers give a light touch to \"Sensualidad\". I like particularly well \"Viva la Media Naranja\" and \"Se Você\" (sung in Portuguese with the backing of the Anjos do Inferno).Niñon Sevilla is in top form. She's a wonder to behold.",
