    "introduction": "The SS was the Nazi state’s instrument of domination and oppression, responsible for the intelligence services and the police. The SS committed a horrific range of atrocities, including the Holocaust, the persecution of political opponents, and brutal war crimes. Millions of people were victims of the Schutzstaffel, and many of the perpetrators were unrepentant to the end.This six-part documentary provides a comprehensive overview of the SS, describing how a small group of thugs rose to become the most feared organ in the Nazi state. With the help of international experts, the film examines common myths about the organisation. Interviews with eyewitnesses and unapologetic perpetrators take us closer to the psyche of the SS supporters in an attempt to make the inconceivable comprehensible.Episode 1 From the \"Protection Squadron\" to the SS StateEpisode 2 Heinrich HimmlerEpisode 3 The Executioner: Reinhard HeydrichEpisode 4 The Waffen-SSEpisode 5 The SS Death Head's UnitEpisode 6 Unrepentant: The SS and its myth after 1945Produced byDoclights for ZDF and ZDF Studios",
