    "introduction": "\"Unforgotten 24,\" is a feature-length documentary about one man's fifty-year fight to ensure his fallen childhood friend received the Medal of Honor and how his battle lead to twenty-four other servicemen receiving their proper recognition. From WWII through the Vietnam war men were denied America's highest military award - the Medal of Honor. Why were some of these servicemen overlooked for nearly 70 years? Was it discrimination or a simple oversight? Unforgotten 24 explores the fight to set the record straight and give honor to those who risked it all for our freedoms.",
