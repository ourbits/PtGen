    "introduction": "A 15-year-old Kurdish boy, Nehat moves to Istanbul from a war zone, where schooling had become impossible. His name means ‘one who goes but doesn’t return’ in Kurdish. He feels lonely and under pressure; so he finds himself moving in various directions. At one point, he takes a decisive step that will change his life, and he throws the small stone he took from his home village into the air, which falls into a different point in spacetime: a protest area. The story takes a new dimension: Zeynep, 27, tries to take a  step in her life with various encounters. She then meets Nehat, who is now in his thirties. Parallel to their paths, a river ‘tells’ its own life story as well as the life stories of those who have gone away never to return.",
