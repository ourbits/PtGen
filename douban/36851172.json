    "introduction": "Luca Tóth’s Vegan Mayo sweeps us into the life of its ostensible heroine. Sharp-witted and warmhearted, the film plumbs the depths of how we view ourselves. What starts out as an inspirational story turns out to be a humorous reflection of our identity full of twists and turns. Charmingly toying with the hero trope, this film is a tongue-in-cheek invitation to explore the deepest reaches of the self.",
