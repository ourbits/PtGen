    "introduction": "Egor Matveev is a young driver journeying to a small town in the middle of nowhere, re-encountering old friends and looking for love. In director Svetlana Proskurina’s words, ‘The main theme of the movie is the search for one’s inner self. Some find it when they are 70 and some when they are 20. The main character is a naïve sincere boy, who is in process of finding his inner self but it’s a dramatic process.’ A shocking and profound film, but not without its light moments. Also starring the outragous Russian rock musician Sergei Shnurov.",
