    "introduction": "KURAI KURAI is a myth in modern dress set in an unfamiliar land with unfamiliar rules, a desert landscape, the wind, and above all the ever rolling “kurai” (tumbleweed) -- a journey into the unknown. After he finds out that his lover, Vera, is pregnant but doesn't know who the father is, Emo decides to go on a journey. He leaves Vera and the city, to return to the land of his birth -- the land of the kurai -- to find out where he comes from and where he should go. Emo will learn to take life as it comes, and he finally understands the riddle of the kurai.",
