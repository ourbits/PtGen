    "introduction": "Joan Crawford’s close-up in HUMORESQUE. Michelangelo’s David and Boticelli’s “Birth of Venus”. Stendhal was overwhelmed by the cultural overstimulation in Florence, which Graziella Magherini described scientifically in 1979 as Stendhal syndrome. Mark Rappaport describes his fascination for the Austrian actor Turhan Bey, who made a career in exotic roles in Hollywood in the 1940s. A very personal essay about the effect of close-ups, the canvas idols of the dream factory and the role of their admirers and fans.(Stefan Drössler)",
