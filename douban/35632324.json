    "introduction": "The film Consciousness of Context tells through archival materials the story of a small Central European country - Czechoslovakia - strongly affected by the events and ideals of post-war European society. The story of her post-war cinema, which they nationalized on the basis of idealistic pre-war projects, was already abused by totalitarian power, but which gave rise to a climate that was decisive for the development of cinema throughout the region. Above all, however, it tells the story of the exceptional cinematographer Jaroslav Kučera, the architect of one of the most distinctive visual styles in European cinema, the author of the films Daisies , The Fruit of the Trees of Paradise , Diamonds of the Night and All the Good Natives .
