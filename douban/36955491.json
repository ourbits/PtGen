    "introduction": "Samuel is a piano student. He practices constantly and strives to be the best. He will soon have to enter a contest that will define much of his artistic career, or at least that is what he believes. At a party, he meets Camilo, a somewhat carefree actor. Camilo, listening to Samuel play, recognises the lack of something. He asks him to play with his eyes closed. It is at that moment that Samuel understands that playing his instrument is not just about playing well, but that, as in love, it must come from something much more intimate that goes beyond technique and the way everyone says it should be done.",
