    "introduction": "Abhimanyu, Rimbat, Dista, Panca, and Kusuma (10) are playing at their base, on a hill with an apple tree owned by Abhimanyu’s father. They were concerned one day because Abimanyu’s father was going to sell the land as it was barren and no longer productive for farming. They look for ways to keep the land by nurturing the only tree so that it produces fruit by watering, fertilizing, chatting, singing, dancing, and playing together. The tree bore fruit once more, and Abhimanyu’s father canceled the deal.源自：https://jaff-filmfest.org/golden-apple-squads/",
