    "introduction": "On March 11, 2021, a new form of prayer was born at Kiyomizu-dera, Kyoto Prefecture. Dancer and actor Mirai Moriyama dedicated his performance to the Buddhist temple upon completion of its large-scale renovation, done every 200 years. The motif he chose was Kusozu, a 1,000-year-old illustration of the decaying process of a corpse. He conducted fieldwork at sacred sites around Kyoto, with the aim of reinterpreting what he felt there. What did Moriyama create? Director Kosai Sekine documented the process. (Performance organized by PERROTIN / Film produced by NION)",
