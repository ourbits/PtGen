    "introduction": "The film captures a moment of transformation in the life of the protagonist, set against the backdrop of a heated marital crisis and complicated family relationships. We find ourselves on a day when circumstances shatter Amálka's world and bring to it a new, fully lived experience of darkness and personal crisis. This experience then leads Amálka to a different perception of herself and her world,” explains the director. Similarly to the previous films in the trilogy, Tiny Lights is supposed to be an intimate drama. \"Tiny Lights will be a tender story about fragile and extremely important things that happen in one family and fully affect the little girl. For me, personally, this is the first big film work with a child in the main role, but I am very happy about it all.",
