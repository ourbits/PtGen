    "introduction": "Passionate collectors are commonly thought to be loners, always seeking the valuables that will make up for the lack of intimate relationships. Such is American eccentric musicologist Chris King, a renowned collector of old 78 records, who found a sense of belonging when he discovered the folk music of Epirus in northern Greece. A powerful journey deep into the hypnotic and stirring music of a way of life that has been left behind; the portrait of a man whose life was transformed by these soulful tunes upon finding a sense of self and home in a foreign region far away.",
