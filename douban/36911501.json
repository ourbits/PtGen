    "introduction": "What You See of Me opens on Gwen, a young woman sitting in an airport lounge. She’s looking around for her boyfriend Adam, with whom she’s been backpacking. Tired of waiting, Gwen walks to the elevator, carrying her heavy rucksack. When Adam suddenly appears, he’s a little upset that she would set off without him. This couple may be in the same location but they’re clearly on very different journeys. And it’s a sense of disconnect which only deepens when the couple return home and decide to explore polyamory.",
