It was absolutely chilling.'Observer'It said more about pop than a year of Top Of The Pops.'Daily Express'With hideous, clamorous force, Tony Palmer's film about the pop world burst out of the TV screen last night - a disturbing piece of televisionwhich no parent could afford to miss. It was certainly not a film which will die,a psychedelic experience which 10 years from now will be the definitive document of its time. How often does TV really make you sit on the edge of your chair?'Disc & Music Echo'Magnificent - honest, accurate, unbiased and totally frank. As a comment on today, it was horrific and powerful, and as a protest it was stunning. Director Tony Palmer offered no personal comment. Questions were raised and thoughts recorded, but no editorial explanation or reason was forced on us. The conclusions were our own. It was absolutely superb'New Statesman'Brilliant and frightening.'Spectator'Remarkable...I have no doubt that wherever it is shown the film will win professional acclaim.'",
