Thinking she's found the perfect solution, she hires her neighbor, Owen, to be their nanny. Owen is exactly what the Bells need and Lauren couldn't be happier. It isn't long, though, until Owen crosses the boundaries between hired help and man of the house. He begins spying on Lauren and drives a wedge between Lauren and James' already fragile marriage. As his unhealthy obsession with Riley and Lauren continues to grow, it's clear that he will stop at nothing to make sure his new family stays together forever.",
