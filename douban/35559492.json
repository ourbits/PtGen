    "introduction": "After committing a horrible massacre in a village, killing twelve people, the killer shoots himself in the head but unexpectedly survives. Petar, a State Intelligence Agency operative, is attempting to get to the bottom of the case, investigating why the killer said the world \"katabaza\" before shooting himself – just as Petar's late son had done before committing suicide. Nataša, a psychologist, is assisting Petar with the case but, unlike him, she rationalises everything and does not believe there is anything mysterious at play. Tihon, a monk, warns Nataša that her daughter, Ida, is in danger and that demonic forces that possess human souls are behind everything. After attending a black wedding ritual in the village where the massacre took place, Petar increasingly starts to believe in the involvement of supernatural forces.",
