    "introduction": "A scientist creates a mechanical man but thieves steal it and send it out to kill and destroy a city. The only way to stop the creature is by creating another mechanical man to destroy it. This Italian horror film seems to have had an influence on Fritz Lang's Metropolis, at least in the look of the robots. It's hard to really judge the film since so much of it is missing but they did a good job at taking the current length and adding enough background so that we know what's going on.",
