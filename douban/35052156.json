    "introduction": "Eli is a man in his twenties with a calling on his life from a young age, but he's been running from that calling - a modern day Jonah. After being fired by his father, arguing with his girlfriend in front of their daughter, and then a visit to the local pub, Eli decides to get out of town. On a lonely mountain highway Eli misses a turn and careens over an embankment, landing deep in the forest. It is a place of mystery with no way out, but it is there where God works on his heart. Satan is not far behind of course, working to convince Eli to take a different path. In the end Eli is faced with a choice that will have repercussions on generations as his destiny is to be the Billy Graham of his time.",
