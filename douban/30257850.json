A young man deals with haunted nightmares of his abusive family past that seem to arise in his present. Dive into a complex, interracial religious family, whose faith is tested when dealt sexual tragedies and shocking truths. Finally a couple's consistent battle with pride and control leads to an untimely death in the family. Roots of history lie within a hidden deeper battle for their souls. That history shapes their present and fates their future. Before they face each other, they must first face themselves. In order for them to get to the end they must first begin. In order for them to begin to change situations in their lives they must first BREATHE.",
