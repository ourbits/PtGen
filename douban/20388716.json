    "introduction": "Gatling Pictures' \"Cure for Pain: The Mark Sandman Story\" examines the life and work of Mark Sandman, deceased frontman of Boston \"low rock\" band Morphine. From his Newton, Mass., roots to his travels across America and around the globe, Sandman left an indelible imprint as one of the most distinctive musicians of his generation. Along with revisiting the \"unique and sultry sound\" of his music, the film explores the meaning of family through this critically praised and personally conflicted singer, songwriter and innovative instrumentalist.- Written by Anonymous",
