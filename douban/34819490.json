Due to a twist of another aspiring husband turned dacoit Bullet Singh all plans get spoiled. Finally things take a hilarious turn and end interestingly. The celebrated actors have put in their best. But Anirban Bhattacharya steals the show with his deliberately faulty speech. Some elements do not make it a family movie though. In spite of the U certificate some references do not make it suitable for children.",
