    "introduction": "Jean is a Frenchman who heads upriver looking for the man who unsuccessfully tried to kill him—his partner in a shared diamond-mining operation. Jean starts out with vengeance in mind, but by the time he is very far along in his journey he has already been detoured into a series of mini-adventures. Religious processions and their music, several attractive women, fiestas, and other events distract him from his original purpose. By the time he gets anywhere near his goal, he has fallen in love with one of the women he met along the way, and his life and its purpose have changed considerably—but that does not mean he will not come face-to-face with his treacherous \"friend.\"",
