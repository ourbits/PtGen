    "introduction": "16 year-old Lena is a modern heroine ready to do anything to win over the love of her life. The problem lies in the fact that the 'love of her life' is her brother, Noah. He is everything to her: a brother, a friend and in her own oneiric universe, her lover. She is gripped by a real obsession. He is a powerful drug that drives her further away from a world she knows would judge her severely. The reality that surrounds her slowly but inexorably transforms her, pushing her further and further into madness. To distract herself, she encourages Noah's friend Enis. But she is so obsessed with her brother that she cannot curb her feelings. When she decides to openly confess her love to her brother, the rejection is palpable and drives her to find refuge in an unknown world of daydreams and disquieting illusions-allusions.",
