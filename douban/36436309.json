In the shadows of recent eruptions, these actors play a story that is written together with a volcanologist, sand miner, and a mystic–people who have a close bond with the mountain–potentially illustrating fiction and nonfiction situations that could and would have happened in Merapi.源自：https://ffd.or.id/en/film/monisme/",
