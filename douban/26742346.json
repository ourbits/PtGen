Busy mom Alexis has a new job as a morning news show correspondent, and after a three-year feud, Tamra and Gretchen meet to bury the hatchet once and for all. Tamra continues to sell real estate to make ends meet, and shows a very expensive property to filthy rich Heather Dubrow - a former actress, now mother of four - whom she later invites to a dinner party at Vicki's house.",
