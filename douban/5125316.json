    "introduction": "At a time when women's soccer had not yet received the media attention it rightly enjoys today, Aysun Bademsoy made \"Mädchen am Ball\" (Girls on the Ball) in the mid-1990s, a portrait of female players of Turkish origin in Berlin-Kreuzberg, whose Agrispor team was fighting for promotion at the time. The film reports on controversies in the families, in which some view the sport of their daughters or sisters critically. And at the end, it captures the racist structures that still existed in German soccer at the time, when one of the team's players was banned from playing for an incredibly long time.",
