    "introduction": "On the small island of Kihnu off the western coast of Estonia people have their own colorful culture and traditions. Mark Soosaar investigates trough the eye of a camera how the generations turn and pass but the people and the culture still stay the same.Kihnu Woman (Kihnu naine, 1974), directed by Mark Soosaar, earned rather widespread recognition for its vivid color schemes and playful camera techniques, rendering the island’s reality as a rainbow of artistic vision. Soosaar’s approach is characterized by convincing figurative expression and poeticism, but also by provocative staging/inducing of events.",
