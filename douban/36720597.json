His reaction - a completely different one than expected: the attack is taken as an offence and starts a series of liberating beatings that spread through the city like wildfire.\"Someone can't just smack me and declare it art.\" This statement by the then Minister of the Interior Zimmermann about his understanding of art and the change he initiated in the guidelines for film funding was the starting point for Pia Frankenberg's second film.",
