    "introduction": "What was downhill skiing in the 1970s? But more importantly, what did the Italian national ski team represent in those years? Two questions that can only intertwine into a single answer: a success the size and strength of an Avalanche, which could only be the \"valanga azzurra\", Blue like the team's color. Under the direction of a man of exceptional intuitions like Mario Cotelli, the Azzurri's technical director, and in the wake of a champion like Gustavo Thoeni, the team that would become the strongest in Italian history was born. In that period, Italy made the rules, imposing a style that dominated the \"circo bianco\". An unrepeatable cycle that would forever change the history of the sport in the country.A sporting hurricane, which the direction of Giovanni Veronesi brings to life through the voices of the protagonists, anec-dotes and behind-the-scenes footage and images of the time, in 4 episodes that will retrace its entire trajectory, starting from its dawn and ending with its inevitable sunset.",
