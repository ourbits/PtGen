    "introduction": "Mangokal Holi, a ritual to dig and move the bones of tribal ancestors to a new site, is a symbol of pride for Batak family who can afford the lavish ceremony. Unfortunately, the suitcase containing the skeleton of Great Grandpa went missing in the airport. Grandma and the whole clan were waiting, ready to party on the banks of the magnificent Lake Toba, the world’s largest caldera lake. The journey to find Great Grandpa's skeleton threw a family to many hillarious obstacles: racing across the winding road, chasing a dog thinking the bones were his meal, walking through the forest known for its hungry tigers, all in HIGH HEELS! Their family honor is at stake.",
