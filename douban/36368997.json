    "introduction": "The Giants explores the intertwined fates of trees and humans in this poetic portrait of environmentalist Bob Brown and the Forest. From a seedling to forest elder: the film is a masterclass that draws on Bob's 50 years of inspiring activism, from the Franklin campaign for Tasmania's last wild river, to today's battle for the Tarkine rain forest. Told in Bob's own words, his story is interwoven with the extraordinary life cycle of Australia's giant trees, bought to the screen with stunning cinematography and immersive animated forest landscapes.",
