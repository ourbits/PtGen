    "introduction": "Political prisoners’ struggle for their right to read in prison is portrayed through gloomy images of prison courtyard walls, the revolutionary imagination sparked by books, and the use of shoe polish, jam, and olive paste as substitutes for pens… While also employing the technique of re-enactment, Walls tells the story of a resistance that extends from prison courtyards to courtrooms.",
