    "introduction": "Bubble takes place in a tropical fish shop in the East End of London, the last of what used to be many. Tiny, watery dramas inside fish tanks accompany the thoughts of local fish-keepers, while father and son Big Tel and Little Tel work to keep the shop alive. Eleanor Mortimer’s film is a poignant portrait of a changing city and the many lives immersed in it.",
