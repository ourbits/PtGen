    "introduction": "If Earth is understood as a living organism, soil is its most delicate organ. Humankind, the ecosystem’s imponderable factor and major destructive force, has not ceased to inflict wounds upon the Earth’s skin over the last centuries. Whether by shovels, excavators or dynamite, several billion tons of earth are removed each year from their natural surroundings and habitat. An insightful and thought-provoking documentary that navigates through mines, quarries, and building sites, displaying the planet’s scarring. A seven-chapter warning bell over the massive consequences that lie ahead of us.源自：https://www.filmfestival.gr/en/section-tdf/movie/1276/14948",
