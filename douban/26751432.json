    "introduction": "Goldfaden's Legacy is a musical romp celebrating the songs, stars and stories of Yiddish Theatre. From the wine cellars of Romania to Tin Pan Alley and the Broadway stage, Goldfaden's Legacy is a celebration of the music of Yiddish Theatre, its role in the Jewish-American experience and its amazing influence on American popular culture. Like the Yiddish Theatre it celebrates, the film is spirited, colorful, vibrant and fun! Our guide on this musical journey is Zalmen Mlotek, the Artistic Director of The Folksbiene Yiddish Theatre, the oldest venue for Yiddish theatre in the world, founded in 1915. Mlotek, a dynamic performer and world renowned expert on Yiddish folk and theatre music, weaves segments of his one-man show with archival photos, film clips, recordings and interviews",
