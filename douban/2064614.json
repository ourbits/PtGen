    "introduction": "Jim White plays himself in this engaging journey into the Deep South. Director Andrew Douglas tracks the alternative-country crooner as he brings his music to such diverse establishments as churches, jails and roadside bars. Along the way, Douglas shows us the touching world of the impoverished whites who have been cast aside by modern society, only to create their own unorthodox culture. Also features music from Johnny Dowd and Lee Sexton.",
