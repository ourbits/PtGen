    "introduction": "The story kicks off with taxi drivers who are protesting outside parliament in reaction to drastic petrol price hikes. Having swiftly lost faith in Hungary’s newly-born democratic state, they cordon off the Hungarian capital, and soon the entire country, with their cars. The opposition supports them and urges a revolution. The President of the Republic, the press and the public are also on their side, while the various ruling bodies likewise abandon the government which has rapidly fallen out of favour as a result of its Draconian measures. József Antall, a former revolutionary of 1956, suddenly finds himself on the other side of the barricades. He's all alone, recuperating from surgery in a hospital. What should he do? How can he find a solution to this situation? Blockade isn’t just a chronicle of the four days of unrest led by cab drivers: it also shows the struggles behind the scenes of a prime minister fighting for democracy.",
