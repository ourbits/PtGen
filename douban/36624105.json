Our story is seen through the eyes of the two female doctors working in the emergency unit-Dr. Stalnikowicz, a Jewish immigrant from Chile, and Dr. Salameh, a Palestinian Israeli from the north-and from the perspectives of the ER patients whose stories reflect the world outside the hospital doors.",
