    "introduction": "Bonsai -Celebrating the Vision of Muhammad Yunus from micro-credit to social business. What if you could harness the power of the free market to solve the problems of poverty, hunger, and inequality? To some, it sounds impossible. But Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus is doing exactly that. Yunus did his part to fight poverty by micro-lending $27 to 42 women, an effort which has now grown to 8 million women and 8 billion dollars. But he didn't stop there; whenever he sees a problem he starts a social business - showing the world that complex problems sometimes do have simple answers. It's not about handouts, it's about a hand up.",
