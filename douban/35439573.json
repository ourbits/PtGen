    "introduction": "Stan Neumann's fascination for W. G. Sebald's novel \"Austerlitz\" is the departure point and driving force behind this essayistic documentary. While the director traces the life of the eponymous fictional protagonist, he also cautiously draws closer to himself and his own past. On the hunt for their hidden Jewish heritage, Austerlitz's motives and Neumann's emotional responses collide in a forensic investigation situated somewhere between war memoir and the field of art history.",
