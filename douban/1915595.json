    "introduction": "Greg Jerdon (Mark Hefti) is a man who has lost everything, including his will to survive. When he comes to an empty beach to commit suicide, however, his plans are undone when young Julie Peterson (Scout Taylor-Compton) intercedes and saves his life. Realizing that his near drowning was not unintentional, Julie begins the quest to save Greg emotionally as well by befriending him. In doing so, she must battle the alcoholic local police chief who wants Jerdon out of town, her over-protective father and unsympathetic stepmother, and a jealous not-so-secret admirer. Despite the obstacles, Julie is determined to give this broken man the gift of hope. In doing so, Julie sparks a chain of events that force those around her to face up to the loves they have lost and their fear of the future so that they can open their hearts to truly live",
