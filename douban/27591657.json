    "introduction": "影片原本计划围绕一对纪录片导演父子的旅程展开。儿子将旅行的目的地定为其父的出生地法国，也是为了挽救两人之间冷却的关系。途中两人不得不直面很多复杂的问题，在编辑影片初期就遭遇了意见不合，导致最终诞生了两部不同的作品。使用同样的镜头素材，两位导演将两个完全不同的视角结合在了一起。The initial plan was to make a film about the journey of Marcel Łoziński and his son Paweł, also a documentary filmmaker. Their joint trip to France, where the father was born, was the son's idea proposed in order to help them both manage their relationship. The experiment led to a confrontation with tough questions and, as a result of the difference of opinions, which arose as early as at the editing stage, two films were created. Using the same material, both artists adopted two different views of their journey made together.第35届莫斯科国际电影节 圣乔治银奖",
