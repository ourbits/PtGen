    "introduction": "It is a subversive comedy in which the release of primal instincts becomes the recipe for a successful relationship. Monika and Piotr are a fairly typical couple where passion and sexual attraction have faded away, but not jealousy. In order to do something about it, they go for therapy, but accidentally they end up at an evolutionary psychologists office. It turns out that, from the point of view of biology, their desires are perfectly natural and reasonable, justified by reproductive strategies shaped over millions of years of evolution. Bozena and Dariusz, in order to save their relationship, decide to live according to evolutionary psychology, how they were shaped by nature.",
