    "introduction": "The Outsider is an ultra-rare BBC documentary about the legendary American composer and instrument creator Harry Partch (June 24, 1901 – September 3, 1974). He was one of the first twentieth-century composers to work extensively and systematically with microtonal scales, writing much of his music for custom-made instruments that he built himself, tuned in 11-limit (43-tone) just intonation - meanwhile living as a railroad-riding hobo for 9 years during the Great Depression!",
