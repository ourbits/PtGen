    "introduction": "Bogdan Khmelnitsky is the one of the great epic war films. It is not so famous, like 'Alexandr Nevsky', but still great. And besides, it is much more stuck to the real history. 17th century, Ukraine is under the yoke of the Polish servitude for centuries. And there is almost constant war between Tatars, Poles and Cossaсks for decades. Finally Poles decided to eliminate the Ukrainians. But there was a time, when Cossacks lived in the Ukraine. The real Cossacks, they were brave, decent and devoted to their brotherhood. You can even be Tatar or Pole, but if you became orthodox and love freedom, they accept you like their brother. You only should not drink 'gorilka' after Cossacks set out against an enemy. May be they look funny to the western public, but you can find a lot of great deeds and sacrifices in this movie.",
