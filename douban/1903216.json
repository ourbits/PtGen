    "introduction": "Richard Condie, under the umbrella of the National Film Board of Canada, does some fairly odd and wonderful work. This one is pretty strange even for Condie! I am seldom at a loss for words, but trying to describe this one and do it justice is difficult. This airs somewhat frequently on O Canada on the Cartoon Network. The show itself is well worth watching. Catch this one if you can. Highly recommended!",
