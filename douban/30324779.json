    "introduction": "An extended investigation into the fur trade that China is estimated to produce approximately 85 percent of the world's fur products - and it has virtually no regulations or rules for the treatment of the animals. According to Mark Rissi, a spokesman for Swiss Animal Protection, which has documented abuse of animals raised for their fur as early as 1983, the China project has been going on for several years. The Swiss Animal Protection report said slaughter methods range from beatings with a metal or wooden stick or swinging the animal until it slams to the ground. Then they are skinned.
