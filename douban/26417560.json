    "introduction": "For a Brazilian kid, Junior seems to have everything going for him — which is to say that he has a lot of football talent. So what if his girlfriend is pregnant, he's living with his alcoholic uncle, and he's got no money? Hope can be a terrifying thing when it is full of the unspeakable fear that it might lead to failure. Junior knows that football is a game for men, but how to be a man? Hopefuls recently won the Carte Blanche prize at the famous Karlovy Vary festival.",
