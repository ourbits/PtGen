    "introduction": "A story of family, of dreams deferred, and of a final chance at redemption. David Paxton, nearing the end of his minor league baseball career, returns to his hometown as much less the hero he once assumed he would become. When he meets Joan, and her son Ross, David believes he has found a way to acquire the love, support and family he's long been yearning for. But his overheated romancing of Joan makes her wary, and his attempt to mentor Ross meets with the boy's undisguised contempt. It appears his dreams of a future have died, and David's simmering rage threatens to erupt into violence. But David and Ross, a disturbed 12-year-old heading down a path of increasing destructiveness, somehow find their way to each other and start up a most unlikely, mostly clandestine, friendship. David must break out of his own isolation to help the young boy and confront the dark secrets that haunt both their lives. He must become a father figure in a way he never imagined, and in so doing become a genuine hero off the field.",
