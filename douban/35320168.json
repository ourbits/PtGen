    "introduction": "After decades of living in Hamburg, Reyhan returns to İstanbul with her husband for a short while. On the eve of her return, she realizes that her sense of smell has gone. When a doctor’s appointment leaves her anxious about the possibility of a serious illness, she decides to follow her instincts to regain her sense of smell instead of undergoing more tests. To establish a new bond with life, Reyhan chooses to leave everything behind. She vanishes, secretly moves into her late grandmother’s flat, gets a random job at a hotel, and meets a blind man. Just as she assumes a new life seems possible, she realizes she has become a missing person. She considers this her chance for freedom.源自：https://www.antalyaff.com/en/movies/nationalfeaturefilm/23/316",
