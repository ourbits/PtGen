    "introduction": "As it's been already written in description Die Ausgesperrten is made after a novel by Nobel Prize winner Elfride Jelinek. If that wasn't enough of a recommendation, she has also co-written the screenplay and has an episode role in it as a teacher. It's also less known in comparison to Haneke's La pianiste, which was also made according to Jelinek's novel. For all the fans of Jelinek's work, this means heaven. For the rest of you, this might be a good introduction into her work/world. Dark, grotesque, violent are all the words that only half-describe Jelinek's critique of contemporary (Austrian) society. On the top of all that, our dear stefflbw made subs for it!Two young characters in this story of rebellious youth are named after two Germans, brother and sister Hans and Sophie Scholl who were imprisoned and executed for their anti-Nazi stance during World War II. In this film, the rebels do not have such a clear-cut enemy but nevertheless, they cannot accept the way life is heading in Austria of the 1950s and they revolt by stealing, mugging, and trying out terrorist methods (bombs). Their future seems to be inexorably heading on a collision course with the forces that have \"locked them out.\"",
