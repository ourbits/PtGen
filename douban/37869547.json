    "introduction": "A young boy commits an accidental murder which causes a stir in the community and forces him to choose between his loyalty to the gang -AND- saving what's left of his innocence by turning himself into the police. Inspired by the last days of Robert Sandifer's life, the story made headlines and appeared on the cover of Time Magazine - showing America a world where children become warriors, grown men give the orders and make the money, and the street gang is family, employer and executioner. —Chris Bailey",
