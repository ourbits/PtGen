    "introduction": "The fate of a championship is being decided on a soccer field, but along with it, the lives of many people who have decided to turn things around are at stake. Be it for money, as is the case of Italo - president of the Sporting team who bet everything he has left on the final result; be it for honor, as is the case of coach Bulla - who has never won a title his whole life; be it for a dream, as is the case of Antonio - the team captain who wants to go pro. Away from the field, the rest of the world keeps living, dying, and showing off its contradictions. But inside the game, time comes to a halt because it's the most important of all moments.-微博@摆渡字幕组 整理",
