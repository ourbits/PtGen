    "introduction": "Since the age of 16, director Chloé Barreau has filmed her lovers. Living between Paris and Rome, she has snapped photos and made videos of every man and woman she loved. From teenage crushes to long-distance commitments, one-night stands and deep devotions, her cameras captured each affair, suspending that version of each pair forever together on screen. But every relationship has two points of view, so Barreau embarks on a remarkable method of autobiography to tell the full story of herself: she arranges for each of her exes to be interviewed on camera by a neutral co-author, so they can freely describe their versions of her, the woman they loved. Layering these present-day conversations with her rich archives of the same relationship, Barreau constructs an engrossing and thoroughly original history of her heart.",
