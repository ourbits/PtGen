It provides a home for a demon that has also come straight from Hell. This DEVIL DOLL is the star of a pay per view Reality TV show that is hosted by a psycho, who believes that he is Count Dracula. Six young adventurers (three male, and three female) are offered $100,000 to spend all of Halloween locked in a room with the DEVIL DOLL, who has reportedly caused the deaths or suicides of over fifty people during the last two centuries, always on Halloweens when there was a full moon. THERE IS A FULL MOON ON THE HALLOWEEN WHEN THIS REALITY TV SHOW IS HAPPENING. The room that contains the adventurers, and the DEVIL DOLL has many surveillance cameras that broadcast whatever happens to the pay per view audience, who also have the option of betting on which horrific outcomes might occur in that room.",
