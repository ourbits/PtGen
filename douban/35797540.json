    "introduction": "Simón is vying for a position as a columnist for a prestigious newspaper, all he needs to do is submit an article demonstrating his talent on the very same day as the Apollo 11 moon landing. While having dinner with friends, Simón unwittingly hears a story with the potential to earn him the columnist role, as well as the success and fame he’s always dreamed of. It turns out that Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon, might actually be Mexican. Simón senses there might be some truth behind the rumour and sees in it a chance to win the coveted job but also his father’s longed-for approval. Joined by his partner in crime Carlo (Alessio Lapice), Simón decides to set off for a small city in southern Jalisco called Llano Grande, in a bid to find out the truth about the man we call Neil Armstrong.",
