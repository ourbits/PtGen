    "introduction": "Kuba and Jurek are friends. They work together clearing the forest and spend their free time together, too. Both live in the village of Olchówka where life goes by at its own unhurried rhythm - people know each other very well, the atmosphere is bucolic and leisurely. One day Kuba wakes up after a passionate night and finds himself in the middle of a field, accompanied by cows. Then he cannot find his mate. So he decides to look for the girl that they both met that night.",
