    "introduction": "There are a few places in the world where it’s possible to see a whale out your window. From a remote cabin at North-West Bay on Campbell Island in the remote sub-Antarctic Ocean, it is possible to experience the wonder and joy of whale courtship and mating.Braving the elements of ninety know winds, torrential rain and heavy snow, Maori naturalist Ramari Stewart reveals her own unique perspective on the island’s marine mammals and birds. We glimpse the special bond she had with the rare and endangered Southern Right Whale, Hooker Sealions, 3.5 tonne Elephant Seals, the Great Southern Royal Albatross, and the Yellow-Eyed Penguin.",
