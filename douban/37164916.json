    "introduction": "Wandering through the ordinary sights of day and night. How, in this vast cosmos, did all this happen? We live in a world of constant transformations. Somehow, aeons ago, consciousness came about. I'm often drawn to think of the earliest stages of life when we were swimming blindly in water. How was it possible to develop that bubble-like appendage to our brains that allowed the great miracle of sight? What a revolution in that infinite cosmos for consciousness to join with sight. (All this taking place among bubbles near a warm shore). Was this event some kind of mandate from the Universe so that it might know itself? Are we tools in that quest? How do these thoughts fit into the parade of ongoing distractions that make up daily life? CARELESS PASSAGE will answer none of these questions. Its purpose is to muse and swim among migrant sights seen by the transforming eye of a camera.-- Jerome Hiler",
