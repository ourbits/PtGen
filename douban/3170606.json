Mika dreams of going to her brother to Paris, but without money or passport she is forced to accept the help of a former stuntman who is now touring provincial towns presenting primitive rodeo shows. On the road they pick up a boy in search of his long lost dog who was trained to jump on and off trains. When the youngster realizes that the cowboy is going give up Mika to the police, he offers her a ride to Belgrade on his motorcycle. There she attempts to get a passport with money she stole from the cowboy, but her criminal friends deceive her and the boy's bike is destroyed. In desperation, Mika tries to get rid of the affectionate boy who still wants to help her and jumps on a passing train. Trying to catch up with her, the boy injures himself and falls under the train. With the horrific scene moving further and further away from her, Mika notices the boy's dog peacefully riding her train. Goran Paskaljevic, Yugoslavia, 1977, Serbian/Subtitles: Slovenian, 83 min, fiction film, DVD-ROMA girl named Mika, convicted for petty black-marketeering, makes her escape from the train transporting prisoners to prison. She has been dreaming of Paris for some time, and that's where she wants to go at all costs.Her freedom, however, is illusory: without money and identity she must accept the help of a former stuntman now touring provincial towns and presenting primitive rodeo shows with \"scenes\" from well known westerns.During his tour, stuntman also meets a young man, with no family and no job, who's searching for his long lost dog. He truly believes in love and friendship, unlike the stuntman and Mika, and will do anything to win their affection.",
