    "introduction": "An afternoon at the edge of a large film set somewhere out in the sticks in rural France. A trainee takes up his position. He is responsible for blocking off the street while filming is in process and reopening it to traffic as soon as the take is over. His only connection to the set is via walkie talkie. He begins to get bored. The mountains are magnificent. A tractor returns from the field. The trainee turns all the way round. Time passes slowly and we wait with him, merely observing the afternoon - without a single cut or a comma.",
