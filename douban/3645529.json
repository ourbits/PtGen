    "introduction": "Arcadia Lost tells the story of two teenagers stranded in rural Greece after a car wreck. Charlotte (Haley Bennett) is a sixteen-year-old with a deep desire to find connection who hides behind a sullen disposition and her newfound sexual power. Sye (Carter Jenkins) is her recent stepbrother, introverted, intelligent, but forever at an ironic distance from the world through his camera and caustic wit. As they wander the dusty roads and staggering vistas of the Peloponnese, they come across the vagabond philosopher-drunk Benerji (Nick Nolte), an ex-patriot American who is an odyssey of his own. They reluctantly adopt him as their guide, and begin an adventurous journey toward the mystic waters on the sacred flanks of Mount Parnassus that takes them through a landscape both ancient and modern, forcing them to confront the truth of their past and the frightening, beautiful reality of their present.",
