    "introduction": "Jonathan Miller first produced and directed ''Rigoletto'' in 1975. Instead of placing the action in 16th-century Mantua, as tradition would have it, he moved it up to the 19th century, which he felt would be more compatible with Verdi's score. Then in 1982, Mr. Miller went further, transferring the opera to Little Italy in New York City in the 1950's, the world of the godfather and the Mafia. The result attracted international attention, not to mention a cascade of bravos and Bronx cheers.Performed before an audience by the English National Opera, the production was taped by Thames Television. Already broadcast in this country, it is being repeated tonight at 9 on cable's Arts & Entertainment Network. If you haven't seen Mr. Miller's provocative interpretation of this opera chestnut, you should. The presentation runs for three hours, which includes, sorry to say, commercial breaks adding up to at least a half-hour. Tolerance will be rewarded.By JOHN J. O'CONNORPublished: February 23, 1989",
