Together with a small group of miners, they work the artisanal Cobra gold mine to survive. Father and daughter hide a treasure from the others: a vein of gold on which they secretly work at night. Like everyone else, they want to change their destiny. One day a miner discovers their secret and violently breaks into the gold mine. Carola decides to challenge the patriarchal structures and laws of the jungle as well as her own immaturity to continue the pursuit of her longed-for dream.",
