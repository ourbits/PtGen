    "introduction": "A commercially-driven, international Space Race has propelled us to this moment in the 21st century: within a few years, the Moon’s surface may be subject to permanent human occupation, its resources aggressively mined for profit, and its ancient nature-spaces polluted by private industry. Do we want to stand by silently as such irreparable damage is caused to our sister satellite? What if we actually listened to what the Moon had to say? Based on an original poem by award-winning Australian author Ceridwen Dovey, Moonrise is a striking, surreal montage of historical, artistic and scientific lunar imagery that invites us to consider the Moon’s point of view in the face of increasingly exploitative human activity in space.",
