    "introduction": "Although Jeff Buckley only released one album before his tragic death, the man and his music are brought back to life for a while in a new and breathtaking film.When David Bowie calls your album the best album of all time, you’re probably on the right track. Unfortunately, Jeff Buckley only got to release the album ‘Grace’ before drowning at the age of 30 in 1997. It was a tragedy in every way.Through intimate diary entries and home videos, director Amy Berg paints a complete portrait of the American singer. We are there from childhood, when his father Tim Buckley left the family and died of a heroin overdose at the age of 28. That kind of thing scars the soul, and coupled with a fragile spirit, Buckley’s meteoric rise was both a blessing and a curse.With a treasure trove of concert footage from before and during the big break, and interviews with those closest to him, Berg’s film is a gentle declaration of love – and a worthy farewell and thank you for the song to the man with the golden voice.",
