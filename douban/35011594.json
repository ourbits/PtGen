    "introduction": "Pop superstar Adelaide Kay is left behind in Preston, Virginia when her tour bus, controlling manager and entourage accidentally leave without her. She finds herself stranded in the freezing cold with no money, no phone and no plan. A local family, the Lapps, take her in. They know the true meaning of the season, even if they're close to losing their Christmas Tree farm. No one in the family recognizes Adelaide except Dillon, the oldest son--an emerging musician, hoping one day to follow his heart and move to Nashville. Adelaide enjoys the break from stardom and begins writing a new song with Dillon that shows her true voice, as opposed to that of her bubble-gum pop writers and manager. As Adelaide falls for Dillon, she realizes that their song has a chance at saving the farm.",
