    "introduction": "In Antioch, courtyards are separated from the streets with high walls and their doors are always closed. In Antioch, every courtyard is a world in and of its own. Among its inhabitants are Turks, Arabs, Christians, Jews, Armenians, Assyrians, Greeks, Alevites, Sunni Muslims... And a different language is spoken in every courtyard. Eleni is a 27 year-old, beautiful yet rather unkempt woman of Greek origin. She has three daughters ages nine, seven and five. After her husband's death, she has been alienated by her neighbors. Men have stopped speaking with her in order to avoid gossip while the women do the same intending to keep her away from their husbands. Imprisoned in her own courtyard with her daughters, Eleni makes up excuses to go over to her neighbors' courtyards every evening for some communication... In her neighborhood, there are seven courtyards on the same street. As is the case every evening... Written by Anonymous  from imdb.com",
