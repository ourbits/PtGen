    "introduction": "内容简介：新西兰是距离大陆最遥远的国度。它密集的火山活动、别具特色的的动植物群运动都是这座国度一道亮丽的风景线。人群的定居自然会对当地的地貌产生一定影响。本片就是向大家展示多彩的新西兰全景。New Zealand is one of the most remote countries in the world. Owing to the great distance from continents and, as a result of intense volcanic activity, unique flora and fauna as well as extraordinary landscapes have developed in this island country. The settlement of humans over the centuries has naturally also had an influence on the landscape. This film is an invitation to travel across the diverse landscapes of New Zealand.",
