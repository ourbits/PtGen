    "introduction": "One of the world's most legendary pianists reveals new aspects of his life and music in this pair of compelling films. In \"Off the Record,\" Gould revels in his freedom from the public at his college retreat near Lake Simcoe, Ontario, and plays for an audience of one: his collie. In \"On the Record,\" Gould arrives in New York for a recording session, joking and bantering as he reveals his role as a vigorous, sensitive, and critical creator and interpreter of music.",
