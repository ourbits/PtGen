    "introduction": "DIG! XX is the 20th anniversary extended edition of the rock documentary DIG!, which adds new narration by The Brian Jonestown Massacre's Joel Gion, features 40+ minutes of never-before-seen footage, and brings this epic tale through to today. DIG! XX looks at the collision of art and commerce through the star-crossed friendship and bitter rivalry of dueling rock bands -- The Dandy Warhols and The Brian Jonestown Massacre. Through their loves and obsessions, gigs, arrests and death threats, uppers and downers, and ultimately to their chance at a piece of the profit-driven music business, they stage a self-proclaimed revolution in the music industry.",
