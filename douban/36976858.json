At 13, Lili Mukaijima lives in solitude, crafting a dollhouse and daydreaming about alien abductions. A year ago, she lost her mother to self-immolation, and her dog ran away shortly after. Burning dolls’ clothing becomes a ritual for Lili to confront her trauma, while a dog-like monster in her daydreams frightens and comforts her.On her 14th birthday, consumed by despair, Lili considers self-immolation. Instead, her imagination soars to new heights. She encounters “Teacher” in a UFO, gains an understanding of her mother’s death, and transforms her trauma into a new beginning.",
