    "introduction": "Film follows a young couple who are parasites on the lives of others. The film makers largely leave out explanations. Viewers find themselves in the middle of a thriller-like story without knowing the background of the two, and is also left with questions at the end. In the meantime, a strange life becomes visible. The couple lives in a small camp in the woods, with a tent, sleeping bags and empty wine bottles. Isolated, but also unprotected. The girl visits a lonely old lady, for money. The boy also goes to see a married couple whose son died, for a fee. Both think they aren't doing anything wrong, but their work is not without risks.",
