    "introduction": "The extraordinary story of how Soviet ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev defected to the West during the first ever major tour of a Russian ballet company, at the height of the Cold War - and became a living legend.A dramatised documentary, it is a tale of love and betrayal, ballet and espionage; political intrigue and the triumph of artistic expression.The film immerses viewers in a thrilling recreation of the events in the four months that led to Nureyev’s defection at Paris’s Le Bourget airport on June 16 1961, helping to change the course of the Cold War. It shows how those events transformed not only Nureyev’s personal fame and fortune, but those of everyone else around him, and offers a chance to hear this story from those who participated in it.",
