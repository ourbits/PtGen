    "introduction": "ZUCKERBROT UND PEITSCHE (“Sugar Bread and Whip”) was the second feature film written and directed by Marran Gosov. For more information about him and the so-called “Munich group”, check out the biography below (well, kind of) which I typed up. While most of Gosov's films, albeit deeply melancholical, tend to cultivate a humouros perspective, SUGAR BREAD AND WHIP is rather dark and, instead of focusing on bohème life in “swinging Munich”, tells the story of two complete loners: Roger, a male model who, hoping to quit his work which he despises, brutally robs jewellery stores, and Helga, a young woman who is married to a dull arts dealer and withers away alone in his villa. Helga is turned on by Roger's double life and his criminal acts while Helga's bourgeois, but kinky husband is turned on by the fact that his wife sleeps with a criminal. Roger, however, does not have much of a say in the matter since he's running and hiding from two hitmen who have a score to settle with him.",
