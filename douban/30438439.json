    "introduction": "The series is also aired in primetime as a syndicated series. Based on Archie Comics' Sabrina the Teenage Witch, it was a spinoff of The Archie Comedy Hour. The series featured new episodes of Sabrina along with the Groovie Goolies. The series follows a teenaged witch who likes to hang out and fight enemies using her magical powers, without letting her friends at Riverdale High find out.The show's opening strapline is: \"Once upon a time, there were three witches, who lived in the little town of Riverdale. Two aunts, Hilda and Zelda, are choosing the ingredients to create an evil wicked witch. But suddenly, Zelda bumped right into Hilda and accidentally added beautiful girls' stuff as an extra ingredient. Thus, the grooviest teenage witch was born. She has white hair with a pink headband, and blue eyes. She wears a blue dress with a black belt and black shoes. She loves to goof off and battle evil forces using her ultra magical powers. It so happens that she is the first bewitching American superhero — Sabrina, the teenage witch!\"",
