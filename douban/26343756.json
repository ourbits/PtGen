    "introduction": "In 1944 in Alcolu, South Carolina, a 14 year old boy named George Stinney Junior was sentence to death for murder. Accused of killing two white girls, Betty June Binnicker, age 11, and Mary Emma Thames, age 8, George was coerced into confessing and was rushed unjustly through the system and straight to the electric chair. His trial from jury selection to sentencing only lasted one day and less than two months later, George was put to death. He is the youngest to ever be executed in the United States in the 20th century. There were only 83 days from the time of his arrest to the day of his execution.",
