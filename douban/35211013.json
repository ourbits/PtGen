    "introduction": "入围华沙电影节自由精神单元Gertrúd is a middle-aged music teacher. She lives with her art-restorer husband and their teenage son. She is weary of family life, and her relationship with her husband leaves much to be desired. Gertrúd’s settled world is turned upside down when a former student of hers, the beautiful Albán, suddenly shows up. Her presence prompts questions about the past, present, and future. Reality, memories and dreams intermingle dangerously, and the old family roles slowly begin to change. “I wanted this film to be like an enchanted box full of stories and surprises”, Péter Gothár explains. “Its drawers are meant to open in a mysterious rhythm, offering joy and food for thought. First, there was the music of Bartók, which then became the film's main organizing element. It formed around the music – this whole family story full of love and irony”.",
