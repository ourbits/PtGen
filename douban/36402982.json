    "introduction": "I film my grandmothers in their farewell: their hands, their portrait, the cadence of a fading voice. They enter into my camera lens like one who is writing a testament. I want to record their memory. The fragility of an image over time forces me to find the mechanism that keeps the past alive in the face of my great-grandmothers. In that space inhabited by memories, a family archive becomes a national archive. Like a promise, our heritage is a giant belly where other grandmothers once carried us.",
