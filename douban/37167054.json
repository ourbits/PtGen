    "introduction": "This is chapter 451 of Ohio Sonata, a neverending Tolstoyan novel of stock images. An ungovernable soap opera of imposterous photos where film genres devour each other. Filmmaker Lluís Galter reorders and rewrites the meanings of these packets of commercial images, which in turn had phagocytosed thousands of other images, forming a mocking composition that goes from the origins of cinema to the next chapter.",
