    "introduction": "Abbasov, one of the founders of Uzbek national cinematograph, brings out several issues and concerns, typical for the films of Soviet era – the effects of World War II on family life, life in Soviet orphanages and the ‘internationalism’ of Soviet life. Shot in 1963, it shows how children of different nationalities learn to live together as one family as it also brings out ‘Uzbek’ social values – the advantage of a big family and the connections with one’s close community, the mahalla.A touching story about an Uzbek family who gave shelter to 14 kids evacuated during the World War II while their own child was at the battlefronts. Children of different age and nationalities learn to live together in one house -- a Russian boy, Uzbek, Jew, Lithuanian girl, Tatar, Kazakh and others. Every child gets to the Makamov family accidentally but stays there by the good will of the foster parents, who understand that it would be better for the kids to stay at their house rather then at the orphanage during those difficult years. The film has wonderfully combined the ideas of patriotism, internationalism and expression of the national mentality of Uzbek people.",
