    "introduction": "Documentary focuses on 'Sona', the daughter of the director's brother who moved to North Korea from Japan in the early 1970s. Through Sona, the film shows the generation that migrated from Japan to North Korea and their offspring who were born and raised in North Korea. Sona's upbringing is quite normal, but the special aspects within North Korean society make their presence known in a subtle way. By showing the process of the migratory people establishing their identities within North Korean society, North Korea becomes a region that shows a universal view of human society in general and not just a closed society. This approach is a special feature of Yang. She adds normalcy through her depiction of a family to 'North Korea'; a name that we have come to regard as something quite special.",
