Mother Svea's unconditional welcome is balanced by father Heinrich's understandable doubts. To both's horror, having proudly unveiled his criminal profession, he sets off to face his godfather, arrogant local count Gustav. Rather than immediately ordering his execution. Gustaf sets the boaster a triple challenge, which he accepts: he must steal the best horse from the court stables despite guards; next, from the count's bedroom the sheets and a wedding ring; finally, the curate and sexton from the dilapidated parish church.",
