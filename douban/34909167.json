Meanwhile, her friends and acquaintances, regulars and strangers come to the bar. The guests sit, drink and discuss all kinds of topics, from giant snails and invisible cell phones to maggots eating away at corpses. The stories and lives of the guests intersect. Every detail and every anecdote contributes a piece to a larger story that makes this gloomy, smoky bar the best place in the world. But what if Leif never turns up? A smilingly told story about a bartender and her guests. A declaration of love to music and to that one bar around the corner that everyone knows, that home away from home, where you can be who you are.",
