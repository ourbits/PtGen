    "introduction": "Just watched this on the National Film Board of Canada site where they have about 300 of their material presented for your enjoyment. Having previously viewed and commented on a couple of shorts associated with animator Ryan Larkin, I was excited when Street Musique was presented on the NFB site twice in both French and English title form (otherwise, it's the same film). Starting with black-and-white live-action of a fiddle player and a mandolin player performing on a downtown sidewalk, Larkin then does abstract line drawings on white that become images that are very hard to describe. He then does some watercolor (at least that's what I think it is) images that are likewise. All this is done to the music of those two players that matches the drawings perfectly. Nothing else to say except for anyone who loves abstract animation, I highly recommend Ryan Larkin's Street Musique.",
