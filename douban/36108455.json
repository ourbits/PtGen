After one of the local hunter dies after a fall from a deer stand, the policeman Georg Treichel and policewoman Martina Schober believe on a tragic accident. But then it turns out that one of the rungs of the ladder was manipulated, and everything points toward a murder. Shortly after the farmer and hunter Hannes Guggenbauer survives an assault on his car, however Treichel get hurt badly and falls into a coma. Chief inspector Acham from Klagenfurt comes to support Schober. Now everyone suspects everyone else",
