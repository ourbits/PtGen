    "introduction": "Due to the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, tens of thousands of Ukrainians, fleeing the war, found refuge in the small town of Uzhhorod in western Ukraine. The local director decides to attract non-professional actors -displaced people – in bringing his dream into life – to stage the King Lear play. The theatrical performance helps them find themselves and their purpose in a new world where there is war, and the director finds an answer to the eternal question of what love is and why this world should not perish.",
