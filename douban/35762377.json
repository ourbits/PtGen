    "introduction": "Raphi, from France, fantasises about romances with princes, and about starting a traditional family. But in reality, things aren’t like that. She works in a call centre in Barcelona, struggles with at times embarrassing dates, and is diagnosed by her therapist as having gender dysphoria. During this confusing, yet valuable period, we follow this trans woman as she makes her transition, as well as in her everyday life. She talks candidly with colleagues, queer friends, and the men she meets through apps. In spite of all the advice she receives, it turns out that it is mostly time and experience that will help her embrace her place in this world.The screenplay for this social-realist drama came about in close collaboration with lead actor Raphaëlle Perez, as well as by drawing on the experiences of various queer communities. Filmed up-close-and-personal, intimate moments are interspersed with Raphi’s many meetings and her online persona, which changes as she gets to know herself better.",
