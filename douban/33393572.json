    "introduction": "A story of a retired teacher who gets really, really angry. Her arrogant and powerful rival relies on a presumption that normal people never fight against evil. “From now on no one will be so sure about this,” is what he hears from the teacher as she points a shotgun at him.But murdering someone is not easy - not only ethically but also practically. Her ex-student, a repeat offender, warns her: “Criminality looks easy and then there’s always a fuck-up.” More people get accidentally involved in the whole operation and make things really complicated. “Sorry we messed up your murder, mum,” says teacher’s daughter who showed up in the wrong place at the wrong time.No, the story will not turn into a crazy comedy. There will be blood and evil will be punished eventually – although the result will differ from what the teacher planned. The old lady will gain her dignity back and at the same time the author will successfully defend the imperative which claims that murder is wrong.",
