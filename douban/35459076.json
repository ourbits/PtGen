    "introduction": "Four lifelong friends, Greyson, Sloane, Henry and Callie, convene for their last college winter break before entering the dreaded \"real world\". But when Sloane unexpectedly reveals that her family is moving after the holiday, the pressure for a final, perfect Christmas together snowballs into a collision of looming feelings and past regrets. Greyson grapples with whether he should snuff out the torch he's carried for Sloane since grade school, or let it burn brighter than ever. Henry, who's picked up a \"soul crushing\" seasonal gig at the local carousel and its adjacent museum, suggests an overnight lock-in before both venues succumb to the threat of a looming shutdown; Callie, a starry-eyed thespian in training, enlists his help in going viral on TikTok, drudging up uncertainty about their futures, and whether or not chasing the spotlight is always worth it. And while Sloane reflects with her family on memories of loss and love, she realizes that opening your heart-and all the risks that come with it-is a far more meaningful gift than anything under the tree.",
