    "introduction": "What if there was an easy treatment for drug addiction, PTSD, and more “untreatable” afflictions? For many people, this is simply a pipe dream that probably wouldn’t be scientifically feasible. To some, however, there is already an effective treatment for the disease that afflicts over 20 million Americans: a psychedelic compound known as ibogaine. It’s found in the iboga plant that grows across the Republic of Congo and has been credited with helping former addicts heal from their withdrawals. However, for as many benefits as it could bring, ibogaine is far from a perfect solution.",
