    "introduction": "宝丽来纪录片In February 2008, Polaroid announced that it was ceasing production of instant film. 'Time Zero' is a documentary that tells the story of the last year of Polaroid film in three acts. Act I introduces the 'magic' of Polaroid through the perspective of Polaroid artists and former employees of the corporation. Act II begins with the discontinuation of instant film and covers the grass-roots movement to keep it alive. Act III centers on 'The Impossible Project' and follows their against-the-odds effort to reinvent instant film. -- IMDb 剧情简介: TimeZero: The Last Year of Polaroid Film (2011)",
