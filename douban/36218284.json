    "introduction": "Weaving audio-visual recordings of zoo-animals into a fine web comprising of actions and reactions, this video finally spirals into a collective animalistic concert. Relating the different animals to each other through audio-visual montage creates fictional relations amongst the animals; a society of animals. Zoologische Gesellschaft (Zoological society) thus comments on human communities, who created zoos as mirror images. There is an otherness there, and at the same time a disturbing proximity, which we’d like to dismiss.源自：https://www.annoren.com/copy-of-blue-1",
