    "introduction": "El Siglo de las Luces is a historical novel by Cuban writer and musicologist Alejo Carpentier. The book follows the story of three privileged Creole orphans from Havana, as they meet French adventurer Victor Hugues and get involved in the revolutionary turmoil that shook the Atlantic World at the end of the eighteenth century. Originally published in 1962, this is one of the most influential works written during the so-called \"Latin American Boom\".Regarded as one of Latin America's greatest historical novels, El Siglo de las Luces know as Explosion in a Cathedral in the English world deals with the impact of the French Revolution on the Caribbean. The main characters are all members of one family: two siblings, Carlos and Sofia, and their cousin Esteban. The narrative deals with the cyclical nature of control, destruction, and development during revolution. Stylistically, it contains elements of Existentialism and magical realism, and it mirrors the tension between Europe and Latin America found in many of Carpentier's other works.",
