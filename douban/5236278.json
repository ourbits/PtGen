Her husband, Stefan (Stefan Kurt), an erstwhile Stasi agent, is now a good capitalist earning a fortune with his \"investments.\" Ivonne has no interest in examining the past until she receives a letter from an unknown woman. Now in prison, Vera Glaubitz (Barbara Sukowa) claims she had an affair with Stefan, whom she knew as Peter, for years. A \"Stasi Romeo,\" he seduced her in order to get her to steal state secrets at the office where she worked. Ivonne visits Vera in jail, and their relationship goes through many phases of hostility, hysteria, bonding, and despair as Vera recounts her story through flashbacks and Ivonne ponders her marriage. Not much to think about there: it stinks.",
