In Volgograd, 17-year old Natasha was an A+ student about to get into a med school. And an orphan from Kostroma, 17-year old Veronika, was just one step away from finding a real family. Their lives were going in completely different paths until tragic accidents led them to end up in the same prison. What more does fate have in store for them? Especially in the light of them becoming friends and deciding to escape prison all together in order to start everything from scratch.",
