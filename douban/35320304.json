    "introduction": "For more than a century, the world has known and loved Charlie Chaplin. A burlesque genius, Chaplin has put his talent at the service of an ideal of justice and freedom. His best scenario was that of his own destiny, a destiny that is part of the political and artistic history of the 20th century. Carried by the voice of Mathieu Amalric, this documentary is the first all-in archive devoted to Charlot. It is based on anthology scenes from his greatest masterpieces and more surprising, sometimes unknown sequences. Real treasures drawn from dozens of archive sources around the world.",
