    "introduction": "An intimate and revelatory portrait of one of the world’s most influential political figures, LULA explores the rise, fall and triumphant return of beloved Brazilian leader Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva, chronicling his extraordinary journey in 2022 to regain the Brazilian presidency after spending nineteen months in prison.With unprecedented access to Lula and his closest advisors, Oliver Stone sheds new light on the charismatic politician in a series of unfiltered interviews and reveals the inside story of “Operation Car Wash” with the hacker and the Snowden Files journalist whose reporting led to Lula’s release from prison.Timely and compelling, the film is a cautionary tale of the increasing danger lawfare poses to democracies around the world and an examination of one of the great political comeback stories of our time.",
