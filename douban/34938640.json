His life will take an unexpected turn when he receives, during his children's radio program under the name of LA NAVE, a call from Gerardo, a child with very limited resources, but with a great imagination, which places Miguel at a crossroads when asking him to Help him fulfill his last wish before he dies: Travel in \"THE SHIP\" with his mother to finally get to know the sea. Miguel will have to put all his capabilities to the limit and leave his comfort zone in order to grant this request before it is too late.",
