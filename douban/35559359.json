    "introduction": "Filip is seventeen, but he is still a kid who loves skateboarding. His older brother will soon leave the family home to live on his own, but he is still a strong presence in Filip's life and tries to prepare him for adulthood. The two brothers have to deal with the recent loss of their mother and with the father whose grief and depression isolate him from the rest of the world and push him towards hard drugs. The broys, prematurely forced to fend for themselves, try to enjoy their last moments of their seemingly carefree lives. They skateboard, kill time roaming around the suburbs, roll joints, have sex in the first sports cars, and then use them to burn rubber in deserted hangars. Little do they know that their brotherhood is about to be put to the toughest test yet.",
