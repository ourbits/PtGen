    "introduction": "Arguably the greatest composer from the Baroque era Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750) composed over 1100 works. His works, particularly in regard to counterpoint, are widely regarded as being amongst the greatest compositions ever written. They are characterized by complex motivic patterns, flexible rhythmic structures, and an innovative use of traditional formsThe Brandenburg Concerti, originally titled \"Six Concerts � plusieurs instruments\", consist of six instrumental works for winds, strings, horns, and harpsichord. They were first presented to Christian Ludwig, a margrave at Brandenburg-Schwedt, in 1721.After their premiere the concerti became a hot topic for endless discussions due to the bold and imaginative use of contrasting instruments, which prior to Bach were rarely used together. The concerti were also orchestrated beautifully and eventually captivated the hearts of European audiences with their uncommon employment of complex harmonies.Because of their flexible texts the concerti have often been performed by large orchestral groups as well as smaller chamber ensembles. They are notably expressive and brilliantly composed allowing directors to easily transcript them. Not surprisingly, they are still amongst Bach's most commonly performed works in major venues around the world.",
