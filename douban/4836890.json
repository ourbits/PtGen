    "introduction": "\"Eyeball Eddie\" is the story of the stormy relationship between a prosthetic glass eye and the insecure boy stuck behind it. What follows is a dark comedy about the price of popularity. In the world of high-school wrestling, there is only the strong and the weak - and EDDIE MALICK may be the weakest you've ever seen. Shy, scrawny, and perpetually body-slammed, Eddie seems as fragile and pathetic as his own morbid glass eye. But when that eye accidently pops out during a match, Eddie seizes the moment, pins his horrified opponent to the mat - and suddenly realizes that the perfect strategy for victory sits in his socket. Of course, as Eddie continues to exploit this advantage, word of his victories spreads through the school - and Eddie becomes a freakish sensation. The bleachers fill with fans eager to see another Eyeball Eddie gross-out show - and while this sudden celebrity status has long been his dream, Eddie begins to worry...is my eyeball becoming more popular than I am?",
