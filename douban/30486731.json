Saved from doomed nonexistence by CQ, a wealthy debonair businessman with more going on than meets the eye, and introduced to a world he is not ready to navigate. We follow him as he chases his dreams -- while losing himself, one piece at a time. GOLDEN BOY is a story with universal themes. Trust. Seduction. Betrayal. Redemption.",
