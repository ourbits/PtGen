    "introduction": "Focusing on Pep Guardiola's impact on football across the UK and further afield, The Pep Effect is an hour-long programme with contributors from all levels of the game.Since arriving at City in 2016, Guardiola has become the most successful manager in the Club's history and cemented his status as one of the finest coaches the game has ever known. As well as lifting 15 major trophies with City and 36 in total as a manager, Guardiola's effect on how the game is played is unparalleled. The boss' style of football and innovative formations have become study material for coaches the world over.In this documentary, we hear from other managers seeking to emulate Guardiola, players who have played under him, journalists who admire his philosophy and amateurs who dream of playing in the same way. That includes the likes of Phil Foden, Rodrigo, Ilkay Gundogan, as well as The Times' Chief Football Writer Henry Winter and Blackpool manager Ian Evatt talking about why Pep's influence will be felt for many years to come in football.",
