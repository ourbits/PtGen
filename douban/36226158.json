    "introduction": "The documentary has recorded the fate of a former transformer repair plant 'Trafacka' in Prague starting from the moment when a group of artists converted the plant into a significant center on the cultural map of the Czech Republic. The documentary shows the gradual development of an alternative center for art, including the personal metamorphoses of the core actors who, as academic degree holders who recently graduated from artistic schools, took care of an industrial space and in a short period of time succeeded in transforming it into a living organism that became an arena for various cultural currents.",
