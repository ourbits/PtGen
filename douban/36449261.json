    "introduction": "On a cold December day in 2017, the bodies of Multi-Billionaire power couple, Barry and Honey Sherman, are found cruelly and bizarrely posed in the basement of their Toronto mansion. The case immediately becomes headline news attracting global interest. More than five years later, no suspects have been named, no arrests have been made, and the double-murder case remains unsolved. Now, in a four-part series, the nation's leading Investigative Journalist and pre- eminent expert on the case, Kevin Donovan, is on a quest to uncover the truth. Told from his perspective, Billionaire Murders reveals an intimate look at who the Shermans were and what may have happened to them. Featuring exclusive access to prominent Canadians who knew Barry and Honey, as well as Donovan’s fellow journalists and several people who are integral to the investigation, this series delves deep into the mystery of their murders including many twists, turns and outrageous conspiracy theories about “who dunnit.” © Crave Original- Producer: Vince Buda- Executive Producers: Joe Danisi, Vera Lubimova, Kevin Donovan, Jocelyn Hamilton",
