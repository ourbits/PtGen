    "introduction": "BASED AROUND A TRUE STORY Four young film makers have just returned to Sydney after filming a successful surfing documentary. Two international film producers visiting Sydney, fund their next surfing documentary and send them down to film at the Great Australian Bite. On their way through the eerie landscapes and the wide open desert of the South Australian outback, they make a detour from the main road to seek food and shelter in a real one horse town called \"Nowhere Else\". The film makers dine and stay for the night with an estranged man that owns a roadhouse in this dusty town. After an emotional and frightening experience, the film makers decide make a quick exit from the roadhouse. Soon after, their vehicle is immobilized by a flying object, which leaves them stranded in the baron desert. They find shelter for the rest of the night in an old abandoned church, which stands out of place in this barren landscape of nothing. What started out as an exciting fun trip for another surfing documentary, turns into a mysterious night of unspeakable terror and a fight to survive.",
