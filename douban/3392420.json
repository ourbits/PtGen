    "introduction": "Infinito ao meu redor is a documentary that covers two years of Brazilian singer/songwriter Marisa Montes world tour. Featuring her two latest projects, Infinito Particular and Universo ao meu Redor, the movie portrays her international shows during a period in which the music scene was changing radically. The music industry is going through a crisis. Free downloading on the Internet has shaken the structure of the recording industry and is redefining the role of the musician all over the world. Like an invisible fly, the documentary follows the tiresome routine of a world tour. Marisa herself is the guide and the first-person narrator who discusses the changes in her profession, evaluates her twenty-year career and unveils the day-to-day life of a musician in a fun, moving and revealing fashion. From the launching of the albums to the making of the show and the exhausting life on the road, the documentary accompanies Marisa around the globe, and treats the moviegoer as a close friend with whom Marisa talks and reveals the infinite around her. The documentary is co-produced by Conspiracao Filmes, Monte Criacao and Samba Filmes, and is directed by Vicente Kubrusly. Cláudio Torres and Marisa Monte wrote the script and Leonardo Netto and Cláudio Torres managed the production. The DVD also features nine songs shot during the tour for the documentary.",
