    "introduction": "Alex Jaromin (Noah Saavedra) has been living with his mother under a false name in the BKA witness protection program in Athens for 20 years. When she dies, he finds out that the deaths of his father (Daniel Lommatzsch) and his sister in 2003 were not, as he had assumed, the work of Serbian nationalists. In his search for the truth, he comes across evidence that his father was commissioned by the German government to bring a witness out of Baghdad - with the aim of preventing the impending US war against Iraq, which was based on dubious information from the BND informant \"Curveball\". Alex's research stirs up a storm in political Berlin, because some of the actors at the time, who have since made careers, appear to have been involved in the assassination attempt on his father. The more clues Alex follows, the more danger he is in. When he uncovers one last big secret, a race for life and death begins.",
