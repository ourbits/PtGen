    "introduction": "This new BBC commissioned series makes a compelling case against the dumb-it-down trend that has taken over most mainstream science related programming in the last few years.Jim Al-Khalili, the head of theoretical nuclear physics at the University of Surrey, brings absorbing and accessible views on the development of fundamental physics ideas to the screen for both non-scientists and scientists - my(very non-science) pre-WW2 vintage mum was captivated.Even if you already have a strong science interest/background, this captivating mini-series offers a different take on many familiar (and not-so familiar)names, their relationships and key events (Einstein, Bhor, Curie, Rutherford) that makes it well worth a viewing. Perfect material to encourage a real interest in youngsters as well as the more cynical \"eldsters\"",
