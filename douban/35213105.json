    "introduction": "Controversial political journalist David Freeman is met outside one of his lectures by a man with inside information about an imminent false flag event. An event that's responsible for the deaths of forty one women and children in a remote northern Canadian town. He's thrust into the middle of the fray when he's contacted by the shooter who claims not only that it's a US staged event but that he has information documenting all of the US's attacks on innocent people across the globe. With everyone searching for the truth, it is up to David to make sense of one of the most complicated black op plans in US history.",
