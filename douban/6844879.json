    "introduction": "As Cheng Kang’s [14 Amazons] is shown at this year’s Busan International Film Festival as a special screening, a Korean film [A Journey with Korean Masters] will be screened. It’s an omnibus film consisting of 5 shorts directed by 5 veteran Korean filmmakers that were once among the most prominent in the industry: Park Cheol-su, Byun Jangho, Lee Doo-yong, Lee Chang-ho and Jung Ji-young. It is a modest project about Seoul, produced by the A Journey with Korean Masters Production Committee. In this film, the masters collaborate with a wealth of actors of varying generations in promoting the city, integrating its past and present throughout the film. This special screening is an excellent chance to enjoy the hallmarks that define these mature, highly experienced directors. Although some may be familiar, others have not been in the public eye for almost twenty years.",
