    "introduction": "During World War II, in the summer of 1940, Winston Churchill faced a terrible dilemma. France had just surrendered and only the English Channel stood between the Nazis and Britain. Germany was poised to seize the entire French fleet, one of the biggest in the world. With these ships in his hands, Hitler's threat to invade Britain could become a reality. This documentary tells the story of what Churchill did next, and why and how 1,300 French sailors died as a result in what the French still call their Pearl Harbor. This is the forgotten story of Churchill's darkest decision: to sink the French Fleet.",
