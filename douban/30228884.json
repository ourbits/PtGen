    "introduction": "Ja/Nein is part of the anthology ‘20 Action and Destruction Films 1965–1979’, which the filmmaker Ernst Schmidt Jr. describes thusly: ‘This anthology represents a self-contained work of 20 films with durations from one second to ten minutes and is based on experience gathered over 15 years of working with the medium of film. Films 15 to 19 are documentations of happenings staged by the Viennese actionists, including the sensational action at Vienna University in 1968, which led after weeks of demonization at the hands of the Austrian mass media to the arrest of “ringleaders” Brus, Muehl and Wiener, a subsequent trial and long prison sentences for Brus and Muehl as well as to the emigration of the Viennese actionists.’The first part of the collection takes up practices from the realm of expanded cinema – featuring both real and projected curtains.",
