    "introduction": "Little Miss Westie follows two transgender siblings as they navigate puberty, school, family and transitioning during the Trump era. Ren is competing in the Lil Miss Westie Pageant as the first out trans-girl and her older brother Luca is coaching her on posing, make-up, and talent. He knows his stuff because he competed six years ago when he was living as a girl. Moving and unflinching, Little Miss Westie challenged basic ideas about gender, while entertaining audiences as this tween and teen bicker, struggle, and compete while coming of age.",
