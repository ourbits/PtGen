They arrive in an obscure town named Blackwood where they are terrorized by notorious serial killer, Hammerhead, who hunts humans and devours their flesh. His favored tool of death is a large hammer.What four teenagers thought would be a quick shortcut across the English countryside led them to a strange place called Black Wood. Instead of finding a quick route home they encountered Ed Craven; a legendary serial killer known as Hammer Head by the locals. His weapon of choice: A hammer! With the smell of fresh meat in the air, Hammer Head goes on a murderous rampage which includes hunting, killing and eating humans. The group discovers that some legends do exist but will anyone be left alive to tell the tale?",
