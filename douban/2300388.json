    "introduction": "This authoritative film, produced by PJ Productions and Springs Media, asks the question: What is the evidence for the existence of UFOs and alien life? It is a program that seriously examines what can be said about the unexplained phenomena around the world that so many people believe is proof of UFOs and alien encounters. Cases that raise the most vexing questions are carefully examined, drawing on almost 150 interviews with top scientists, investigators, those who claim to have witnessed UFOs, and those who claim to have encountered alien life forms. The program literally reaches for the stars to explore what serious scientists now believe about the existence of life in our universe. It is a program that investigates, speculates and ultimately celebrates the possibility that we are not alone.",
