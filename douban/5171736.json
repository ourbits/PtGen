Three guys from Central Florida that film Internet Comedy Sketches as \"Wooden Steel Productions\" set out on a cross country \"Skittin Across America\" trip and they made their own dreams come true. Shane Hartline, Scotty Trimmier and Drew Roberts hopped a train and began the journey of a lifetime. This was no ordinary journey because the final leg of it will hopefully end up helping thousands of America's youth. How could three unknowns from little Lake Wales, Florida really travel and film with famous people all over the United States? Well, it truly happened.",
