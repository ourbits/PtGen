    "introduction": "«No more everyday life» is a story without the traditional WW2 heroes, but two young women who were in love with life, the world and each other, and, as Gunvor Hofmo later expressed: «Did not know that such evil existed». Now they seem like modern human beings, who fought to take care of and protect the core of being human, but at a high price. In this documentary we follow in their footsteps, examining the ideas behind Hitler's racial state, and how this pursued them and lead to Ruth Maier being arrested and killed. As Gunvor Hofmo wrote in a poem: «If we should ever forget: It is on their ashes we tread.» Hofmo's fate was not to forget, but to try to turn the pain into poetry, and to preserve Ruth Maier's writing.",
