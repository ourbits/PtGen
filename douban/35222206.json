They wake up happy on their silver wedding anniversary, but the peaceful atmosphere does not last. The couple ends up in a huge fight causing Mrs. Gommesen to leave the house in fury. Her husband’s anger quickly fades when Lawyer Vinkel makes a surprise visit, delivering a present from Gommesen’s rich uncle in Chicago: A check of 25.000 DKK. Learning that it can only be cashed on the condition, that the Gommesens lead a happy, peaceful life together, Mr. Gommesen rushes out to find his precious wife. Will he make it in time or is he forced to give up the fortune?",
