    "introduction": "eachers and experts have long known that keen readers make good students, and yet more than ever before distractions including technology and social media make it harder to get a teenager to pick up a book. Some of our best-known faces take on the challenge of convincing a group of disengaged kids to fall in love with books and start a reading revolution in their schools.It will be an emotional journey as, with expert help and support, these personalities attempt to open children’s eyes to the worlds that lie between the covers of their favourite books – and be open about their own formative experiences in their hope of inspiring their class. But at the heart of the series will be the personal stories of the pupils as they reveal what has been holding them back from picking up a book, from peer pressure and other distractions to the stresses of modern family life.Can our passionate advocates convince a class of teens to go out, share their story and spread the written word? Might they even provide these pupils with a life-changing experience and turn them on to the joys of literature?",
