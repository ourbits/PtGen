Whilst anxiously awaiting his girlfriend’s decision about a certain life-changing matter, he has to accompany his first ever clients: Michael and Gordon. Two Chinese businessmen who have come to Barcelona with the aim of closing, in under 48 hours, a multi-million dollar contract with an American magnate. They’ll help each other, as they set out together on a journey to the edge, in a world in which dreams wander like an ownerless dog, pistols and prostitutes don’t do what they’re meant to do, and the questions have yet to find answers. But as long as there’s a reasonable amount of blood, then there’s nothing to worry about.",
