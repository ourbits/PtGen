He played Quasimodo and the eponymous lead in The Phantom of the Opera, and he also appeared in ten films directed by Tod Browning. This imaginative hour-long compilation of excerpts from his surviving works offers a new take on early films and comes with an unsettling soundtrack from Bernhard Lang.",
