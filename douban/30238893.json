    "introduction": "It asks a simple question, also quite complex: what is a good man to do in a war that is clearly wrong? At the film’s core is the story of the medal itself: a fabricated account that nonetheless describes an inarguable heroism. The stories are interconnected by reels of extraordinary color combat footage, shot by soldiers themselves and edited in-camera, unearthed from the National Archives in Washington.",
