You can just imagine these filmmakers spending years of their lives in darkened rooms watching \"Plan 9 from outer space\", \"The day the earth stood still\", \"This island earth\" et al. and you know they know all the classic lines from them.Acting, Story, Music, Photography all spot on, in short - Encore!!",
