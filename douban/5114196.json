    "introduction": "Annetta attends high school and lives with her parents and young brother in a modest house in a rural area of Sicily. She suffers from the lack of freedom granted to her by her parents, subjected to the common mentality of the place, very masculine and obtuse that requires women not to show any emancipated behavior. A freer friend invites her to a party during which she meets a boy she immediately likes. She decides to see him unbeknownst to her parents, but when she is discovered as a punishment she is locked up in her home and withdrawn from school and because of the stupid rumors that in the village already fall on her account she is sent to live at her paternal aunt's house. Here she is not well because of the abuses of her aunt's husband and then she decides to react, denounces her uncle for the violence suffered and marries her boyfriend for not having to go home to her parents and all that remains is to hope to give her daughter a more free, happier future, less slave of prejudices and taboos.",
