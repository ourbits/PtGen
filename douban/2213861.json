    "introduction": "Out West is a 1918 short comedy film, a satire on contemporary westerns, starring Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle, Buster Keaton, and Al St. John. It was the first of Arbuckle's \"Comique\" films to be filmed on the west coast, the previous five having been filmed in and around New York City. The idea for the story came from Natalie Talmadge, who was later to become Keaton's first wife.The story involves Arbuckle coming to the western town of Mad Dog Gulch (which the intertitles call \"the toughest town in the movies\") after being thrown off a train and chased by Indians. He teams up with gambler/saloon owner Bill Bullhorn (Keaton), in trying to keep the evil Wild Bill Hickup (Al St. John) away from Salvation Army girl, Salvation Sue (Alice Lake). Fatty and Buster have a series of adventures trying to beat St. John, until they discover his one weakness: his ticklishness.",
