Although commercially successful, their growth into a music powerhouse was not without tragedy.As brothers, the Bee Gees remain as the most successful family act of all time. From folk balladry to the disco falsetto, this biographical documentary will take you on a journey through the decades as the Bee Gees transform their musical style, reinventing their image to become the poster boys of the disco movement.",
