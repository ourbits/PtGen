    "introduction": "Placed on the driver’s cabin, the camera seems to lead the way! And off we go to the prestigious Paseo de Gracia, the Calle Salmeron, before driving through Lesseps Square…The absent-minded pedestrians wait for the very last second to move aside. Foolish children run across the tracks. Bicycles race the tram, zigzagging dangerously on the rails. But despite all this hustle and bustle, the tram doesn’t seem to hold a grudge against them. It takes its time, revealing the city and its beauties in this age of modernism.",
