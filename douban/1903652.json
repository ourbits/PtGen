    "introduction": "Being a fan, and having seen a considerable amount of Bill Plympton's delightful output, I have to say that this apparently lesser-known work is one of my favourites. The vignettes that narrate a tree's long life through centuries contain a perfect mix of delicate and naughty humour, also elaborating on each other and adding layers to the story, and reaching a magnificent ending,the only one that it could have had, really.  From all the works of the Portland genius, it is this short gem that I find myself coming back to most often, and the experience is always a rewarding one. Highly recommended.",
