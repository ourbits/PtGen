    "introduction": "To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Guggenheim's landmark New York building and to document the origins of its design, the museum and Second Floor Films have sourced rare archival footage and shot new interviews with notable artists, architects, historians and curators. While heavyweights like Frank Gehry and Jenny Holzer weigh in on the strong (and not so strong) points of Frank Lloyd Wright's revolutionary creation, historic and contemporary images of the building itself are what gives this film its heft and magic. After debuting in 2009, the film has screened at Guggenheim institutions around the world and is now shown regularly at the New York museum, giving visitors, at long last, a real sense of its inspired and tumultuous history.—Donovan Ambler",
