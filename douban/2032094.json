    "introduction": "This lovely Canadian feature has Claire Bloom, playing younger than her real age and looking plump, as an English woman who leaves her marriage after 40 years. Although the narrative presents living on the pension as near-homelessness, with Bloom rifling through garbage to find useful items, her new life also happens to provide her with a protective boarding-type house, and a romance with a younger man. The romance is helped by the charm of Danjel Lavdie who plays off Bloom's elegance - though she uses a manic laugh to suggest that isn't totally a lady.The treatment features an unintentional laugh in a gay man's line \"I've never seen someone so careless with his (chess) queen\", and a funny intentional exchange between Bloom and her ogre husband - \"Couldn't ply your legs apart with a crowbar\", \"That probably wasn't the best way to try\".Susannah York pops up as Bloom's oldest friend, but she is featured in some of director Claude Fournier's ill-advised fantasy scenes - one where a boy in a thong parades for both women, and others where the characters are outlined with white light.",
