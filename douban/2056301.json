    "introduction": "On Air with Ryan Seacrest was an American syndicated television talk show, which ran from January 12, 2004, through September 17, 2004. The show was broadcast live from a studio in the Hollywood and Highland complex in Hollywood and featured a background view of the street scene below.On Air struggled in the ratings throughout its short run. It featured well-known guests, and capitalized upon the fact that host Ryan Seacrest concurrently hosted American Idol by featuring contestants who had been eliminated from the popular talent program the night before. During the Summer of 2004, On Air with Ryan Seacrest launched a mass advertising campaign to attract viewers, but it had little effect. By August 2004, 45% of television broadcasters that had purchased On Air had removed the show from their schedules, and production of the series ended on September 17.During the show's run, Seacrest not only hosted American Idol, but also a daily morning radio show on Los Angeles top 40 station KIIS.Fox在04年推出的一档由Ryan Seacrest主持的明星访谈节目.已经停播,不过radio show仍然在继续.现在在iTune上可以订购每一期的Podcast.很多大牌明星都曾在这上面爆出轰动性的新闻.",
