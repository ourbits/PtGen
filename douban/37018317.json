    "introduction": "2011年3月11日の震災の後からずっと追いかけてきた一人の撮影カメラマンのドキュメントが漸く完成し、世界のチャンネルNHKWORLDで放送されました。今を懸命に生きる人たちにドキュメントが世界中の方々の心に届きますように。After the massive earthquake of March 11, 2011 struck his hometown Minamisanriku, photographer Sato Shinichi quickly evacuated to high ground with nothing but his camera. A tsunami of unprecedented scale would soon claim the lives of many of his fellow residents. In its aftermath he created a photographic record of what followed. Some 300,000 images in all. 10 years later, we peer through his lens to discover the despair and regret as well as the hope and will to recover of his fellow survivors.",
