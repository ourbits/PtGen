Released many years later, Paul discovers that his ex- has remarried to a wealthy man, and begins spying on the new family at their luxurious summer house in Switzerland, hoping to one day reunite with his young son. “Using a minimum of means with a maximum of precision, [Blain’s] portrait of Paul’s obsessive desperation in the face of inevitability emerges with shattering clarity,”—Christoph Huber.",
