    "introduction": "Michel Vaujour, former thief and mobster, always chose making a break for freedom over a life behind bars, adventure over a life of submission. He has spent 27 years in prison, 17 of those in solitary confinement. He succeeded in carrying out amazing escapes with toy guns, worthy of a Hollywood script, including a daring helicopter breakout from the roof of a jail. He was finally released on parole in 2003. This documentary is an uplifting and universal story of a remarkable transformation. Michel Vaujour's greatest escape was not from jail but from himself. The liberation of the mind and ultimately, the soul. His isolation forced him to continuously confront himself. The reward has been self-enlightenment.",
