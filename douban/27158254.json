    "introduction": "A Bulgarian photographer helps a stranger and her depressed brother in a hard-hitting, empathetic drama about leaving your internal prison.Philip feels that he is a failure as a photographer. He is a loner, walking around and taking sporadic snapshots in search of inspiration. After meeting a melancholy woman, he decides to help her brother – who refuses to leave the house after an assault. Philip starts showing him photots of the world in order to bring him back to life. A moving, minimalist film about the power of photography and cinema, and about longing to escape from a trap you are caught in. No one is the master of their own existence, we all need other people. It's healthy to take note of the beauty in small things and in the rhythm of everyday life.",
