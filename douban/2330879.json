    "introduction": "American Psyche seeks to find the every-day American perspective on social and political life in America following the events of 9/11. Traveling from New York City to Los Angeles, two European filmmakers conduct a series of interviews with Americans of diverse race, gender, religion, and socio-economic standing. As they travel across America, listening to the voices of every-day people, they explore the current climate of social and political life in the United States. American Psyche opens a dialogue on the shared concerns, interests and hopes for the future that Americans have for their society, moving beyond the black and white political portraits of mass media. Written by Boom Pictures",
