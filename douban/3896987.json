    "introduction": "In 1972, a group of imprisoned guerrillas (most of them belonging to the PRT-ERP) staged a successful jailbreak in Trelew, Patagonia. The escapees proceeded to an air base where a group of comrades were to be waiting to help them find passage to Cuba; instead they were entrapped by the Argentine Navy and gunned down at point-blank range. Made in urgent response to the massacre (and the assumption of power by Héctor José Cámpora, who merely prepared the office for Perón’s return later that year), DON’T FORGIVE, DON’T FORGET is a rare document of solidarity between middle classes and guerilla forces",
