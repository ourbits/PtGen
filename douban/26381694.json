    "introduction": "Big Brother 5 was the fifth series of Big Brother UK. It aired from 28th May, 2004 until 6th August, 2004. The series was notable for its fluctuating prize fund, the final value of which depended on the housemates' performance during tasks. The series was won by Nadia Almada; she received £63,500.Contents[show]BroadcastsEditThe series premiered on May 28, 2004, on Channel 4. The contestants were recorded 24 hours a day with cameras fixed around the house, and had to wear portable microphones. Big Brother 5 was the third of the main series to feature a live launch. The launch night saw Davina McCall give a house tour, as well as discuss rumours that had been going on about the series. She then introduced the new housemates, and they entered the house live. Channel 4 broadcasted a daily highlights show, and from the first week there was a live eviction show hosted by Davina McCall, where the evicted housemate was interviewed. In the nightly highlight episodes, viewers are shown various highlights of a specific day in the house. Big Brother 5 saw the return of the psychiatrists providing commentary on events in the game, with the episodes featuring them being the highlights show after the most recent eviction. The live eviction episode was held on Friday, with a pre-eviction episode and an official eviction episode being held with a 30 minute gap between them. The series ended on August 6, 2004, lasting for a total of 71 days. This made it the longest season of the series at the time. The Saturday Night Live spin-off series, first introduced in Big Brother 3, saw housemates competing in live tasks. It would last until midway through this, when it was axed due to poor ratings.",
