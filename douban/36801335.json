    "introduction": "Easter 1988 in Paris, where Claudia von Alemann lived and worked for many years. She invited two friends, feminist filmmakers Danielle Jaeggi from Paris and Paule Baillargeon from Montréal to take part in an artistic and psychological experiment. In the confinement of a rented cinema they looked closely at extraits of their own feature films and talked openly about the intentions behind them, about their aesthetic impact, bearing in mind their roles as mothers, film directors and feminists. And they reflect about how their film making may influence their children and their children may in turn influence their films; they share their dreams, desires, doubts and contradictions.",
