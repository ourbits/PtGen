    "introduction": "A philosophy graduate of the Sarajevo University, Vesna Ljubic studied film directing at the Experimental Center and RAI in Rome, where she also worked as an assistant to Federico Fellini. Her filmography to date numbers over a dozen feature and documentary films made in Italy, former Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and India. Ljubic's movies include a 1971 TV feature film Simha based on the story by Isak Samokovlija, one of the most well-known Bosnian Jewish writers, and depicting the life of Jewish population in Sarajevo. Her feature films Prkosna delta (Defiant Delta, 1980) and Posljednji skretnicar uzanog kolosijeka (The Last Switchman of the Narrow Gauge Railway, 1987) won awards for the best Bosnian and Herzegovinian screen-plays (written by Ljubic) in those years, and her 1991 short feature Iluzionisti (Illusionists) won the Best Director award at Belgrade's Festival of Documentary Films.Ljubic is probably best-known internationally for her 1994 documentary Evo covjeka: ecce homo (Ecce Homo: Behold the Man), an outstandingly creative and poignant record of the siege of Sarajevo (April 1992-November 1995) during the war in the Balkans. Ecce homo won a series of awards (including Berlin 1994, Amsterdam 1994, Cretey (Paris) 1995), and opened the World Peace Conference in Washington, DC in 1994. Ljubic's latest film, Palani (2002), is a documentary made in India.The films of Vesna Ljubic commonly mix the elements of feature and documentary genres, and are often discussed with reference to magic realism given the reappearance of fantastic element in both her features and documentaries. However, her opus is quite diverse both thematically and stylistically, and escapes simple encapsulations. Her Adio kerida thematically belongs to the wider body of cinematic work dealing with the Sarajevo's Jewish culture and authored by directors such as Emir Kusturica, Haris Pasovic and Ian Beran among others, and it also presents Ljubic's own return to this theme which she had worked on in her 1971 film Simha.",
