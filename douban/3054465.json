    "introduction": "User Comments:I really liked this movie! It's a D.C.O.M. (Disney Channel Original Movie) which are pretty good. It's about a family with an only child named Josh. The father of the family gets a job as a scientist and is supposed to move out near some Navajo Indian land. Josh meets a couple guys that become his friends. It's a good story to watch and follow. The parents are portrayed to be loving, caring people for their child. Josh becomes involved with a BMX race with some people that he wanted to make friends with and ends up hurting his true friends in the movie. I like the relationship between the native-American people, the white man, and the buffaloes in this one.",
