    "introduction": "\"THINKING NIETZSCHE\" is an essayistic documentary featuring interviews and performances based on Nietzsche's book \"Human, All Too Human\" which leads the viewer to extraordinary places of thinking. In a Japanese garden in Vienna it becomes clear how \"on long, forbidden paths and routes the unseeable in our world will suddenly be seen.\" Then, in Sils Maria - where Nietzsche formed his thoughts - in the alpine scenery and the Nietzsche-House his texts and positions of the contemporary Nietzsche research connect. Back in Vienna one is encouraged to interpret Nietzsche from a Freudian perspective. And in the art studio it becomes apparent that one can ally oneself artistically with Nietzsche. These European perspectives are supplemented with a performative commentary from New York City.",
