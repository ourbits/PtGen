    "introduction": "Little Thomas simply has no luck. As the smallest boy in the gang, he's not taken seriously and, to make matters worse, he's going to be responsible for a crucial goal at the soccer game. But after the game comes his big moment: little Monika falls into the river and Thomas is the only one, who has the courage to save her - all of a sudden, Thomas is a hero! As a reward, his father buys him a soccer ball, but bad luck returns to Thomas with the arrival of the ball. In the next game, instead of the ball making a point against the opposing team, it ends up flying through the shop window of the baker Knoll. (GWF)Filmed in Bavaria Filmstudios and in Barrandov Studios (Prague). A real rarity: there were only few children's films made in Nazi Germany in 1940s. Likable and heartwarming, not spoiled by overwhelming didactics. It is sentimental, but has various undertones, from humorous to quite dark ones. Recommended.",
