Tarika suffers from a rare bone malformation known as \"butterfly wings\", an abnormality passed down through the maternal line. Despite having lived in the area for a long time, enjoying a peaceful and harmonious relationship with their neighbours, the family have always been seen as strange. And then, out of nowhere, the animals in the village are struck down by disease, the river dries up, and sick boy Nikola dies after befriending Tarika. Driven by xenophobia and superstition, the villagers become increasingly suspicious and decide to deal with this unusual family themselves.",
