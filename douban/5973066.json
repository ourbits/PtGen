    "introduction": "'Bombay Beach' is a poetic film on a possible apocalypse. After man detonates an H bomb on a megalopolis, we follow his lonesome wanderings, as well as those of a woman. They are among the few survivors of the cataclysm, seeking a way out of this strange and beautiful hell. They will eventually never meet, as they have to face a major aftermath: the bomb has disturbed the basic rules of nature, and their old world now seems to escape the rules of space-time. They live in a quantum universe, where ubiquity and teleportation are admitted, and their continual coming and going in the rubble and ruins of the city will find no end.",
