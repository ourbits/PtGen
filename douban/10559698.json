    "introduction": "Guðfinna, a 58-year old mid-level employee of the Icelandic bank Landsbankinn, finds herself victim of the economic failure, loosing not only her job, but her lifesavings as well. Proud beyond measure, Gudfinna struggles to shield her dire circumstances from her family members. But as tensions in Icelandic society grow, as does the inner turmoil of Gudfinna, who deals not only with financial concerns, but ideas of self-worth. Slowly, Gudfinna, much like the Icelandic economy, finds herself metamorphosed into the utterly helpless being.",
