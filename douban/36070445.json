    "introduction": "The gestures of artisans contain ancient wisdom, customs and traditions that are lost over time and that testify to the deep bond with their land. In the mountains of Croatia, director Luka Klapan portrays, with simplicity, without words or musical notes, three men who, each in his own way, are connected to stone. The first extracts stone slabs with a hoe in a quarry, and then shapes them and gives them similar forms with a hammer. The second skilfully builds dry stone walls with stones in the same way they were built tens, or hundreds, of years before. The third is in his workshop, where he saws the stone and then bush-hammers it.  This is craftsmanship that has come down to us and which will in turn be handed down to other men and other hands. A picture of silence and slowness that takes us with our thoughts to a distant time.",
