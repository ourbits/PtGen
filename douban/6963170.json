    "introduction": "Set against the Notting Hill race riots of the late 1950s, THE WIND OF CHANGE is a gripping kitchen-sink drama focusing on the relationship between a father (Donald Pleasence), a world-weary yet liberal man who spends all his spare time looking after his rabbits, and his rebellious, unemployed son Frank (Johnny Briggs). Frank is a bigoted racist who believes that black immigrants are taking all the British jobs, though he doesn't seem too concerned in trying to get one himself. When Frank and his gang of teddy boys beat up a black man who later dies of his injuries, he must face the consequence of his actions.",
