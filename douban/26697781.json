    "introduction": "From 1957 to 1961 170.000 Algerians flee to Tunisia because of the war. Most of them walk by feet across the mountains and the desert, carrying only a few of their belongings in their hands or on donkeys. As there is no clay in the desert they cannot build ordinary houses. They have to live in pits in the ground, covered with canvas, but some are offered to stay in American army tents. The UN Refugee Agency, together with the Red Crescent and the governments of Tunisia and Morocco give every refugee a ration of food once a month, but that is not enough. The Swedish aid organization Lutherhjälpen has erected emergency stations, where children below 14 years of age can get one cup of milk and one piece of bread every day. Provisional schools are also erected, where children at the lower level learn Arabic and at the higher level French. Doctors are coming to the refugee camps on a regular basis to treat the children.",
