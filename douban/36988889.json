    "introduction": "This collection of Bon Jovi performances at the BBC celebrates the band’s 40th anniversary and serves as a reminder of how they became one of the biggest and most successful rock bands of the 20th century. Whether it’s their early 80s performances on The Old Grey Whistle Test and Top of the Pops, their intimate performances for Radio 2 or their huge, stadium-filling tours, the band have delighted fans over the years with their brand of high-octane rock and their devastatingly emotive ballads.",
