    "introduction": "Central Chile and its people were transformed in an instant when a devastating earthquake hit the region on 27 February 2010. As the cataclysmic event strikes, Manuel unexpectedly finds an opportunity to escape from prison and sets out to find his family and friends. He wanders a ravaged and deadened landscape through an unrecognizable country. When he comes across a caged tiger mysteriously washed up on shore, he decides to free the beast.The director’s free-hand camera work and sparse dosage of ambient music give a feeling of authenticity to the protagonist’s tribulations. In his third feature film, Sebastián Lelio (whose The Holy Family triumphed at the 6th NH) examines the ills of his homeland with a brutal honesty.",
