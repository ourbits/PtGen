    "introduction": "Zivko Nikolic是前南“黑浪潮”电影运动中”黑山学派”的代表人物。The best Montenegrin film ever made.Zivko Nikolic is easily the most important Montenegrin movie director of all times and this is his most audacious film. So many fine details that only a Montenegrin can pick up, the language, the mentality, directness of the way people interact. The good side of its mentality, depicted in Milutin, and the dark side - pretty much all the rest...I can't witness if the actual story was in any sense realistic, it was long before my time, however, the people are spot on - bit exaggerated but true to the bone! It is perhaps not the easiest film to watch, however it is incredibly rewarding. The mistake you shouldn't make is to take it literally. It is a very subtle analysis of his beloved and at the same time cursed land.I am still amazed at how he actually managed, and was allowed, to make such an uncompromising attack at the secret police and its legacy in Montenegro. Perhaps he caught a rare moment of about 4-5 years when its grip temporarily let off. After 1989, the guys in leather coats (these days driving Golfs, as another self chosen status symbol)are back in the earnest and this film is very relevant indeed even in todays Montenegrin society.",
