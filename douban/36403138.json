    "introduction": "February 24, 2022. Russian President Vladimir Putin announces a military operation in Ukraine. The first missile explosions are heard in the early hours of the morning in different parts of the country. The war has begun. No one expected this war and millions of Ukrainians are forced to collect their most basic belongings and leave their homes overnight. It is the fastest growing refugee crisis in Europe since the end of World War II. An unprecedented cross-border exodus. Trains arrive in Europe full of women and children as the men are forced to stay behind to defend their country. \"Why\" is a film about meeting women on the escape trains. As we distance ourselves from their home, as the train pulls away, we reflect with them on what they are feeling. And what they keep repeating over and over again is Why?",
