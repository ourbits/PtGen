    "introduction": "一部超经典的墨西哥B-CULT片！！！超搞笑堪比ED伍德的那部牛作。。。Mexican classic cult film consists of a series of three episodes about a masked cowboy who must face dangers such as a vampire and the Headless Horseman. A masked Zorro-like character travels the West, battling monsters and protecting the innocent in this 1965 Horror/ Western Cult Classic. The Masked Rider fights an ugly witch, a bat-headed Vampire, a Headless Zombie, living skeletons and one of the hairiest Werewolves ever to appear in a horror movie, all in a style reminiscent of the old Universal Horror Films of the 1940's. The monster masks and special effects in this film are among the wackiest ever created for a horror film, and must be seen to be believed! Without a doubt one of the best Mexican Monster Movies ever made!",
