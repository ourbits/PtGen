Chasing her through the streets to meet her, he discovers the scars on her wrists from a suicide attempt. Her mood is despondent and he tries to cheer her up. The two take comfort in each others company and the girl seems to be responding favorably. The man is a successful architect with a sports car who is separated from his wife and seeing a mistress on the side. She recoils seeing a pigeon clawing the face of a child. The walls of her room are covered with pictures of famous suicide victims. He urges her to jump off a roof in an amateur attempt at aversion therapy. The two return to his apartment where he hooks up a tube to the gas line and turns it one, She awakens, gasps for breath and exits, while he wraps a plastic bag around his face. Jean Louis Trintignant and Heidee Polyoff star as the death obsessed, dysfunctional couple.Director, screenwriter, and producer Antonio Eceiza has spent the latter part of his career working in and promoting the growth of Basque cinema. After Eceiza obtained a law degree from the Universidad de Valldolid, he studied film direction at the Instituto de Investigaciones y Experiencias Cinematográficas in the late '50s, though he never graduated. Eceiza worked as a film critic and an assistant director before teaming up with influential producer Elías Querejeta to produce a pair of short documentaries in the early '60s. Thereafter, Querejeta produced all of Eceiza's early films. Due to his radical political associations, Eceiza moved to Mexico in 1973, where he made two films and lectured at Mexico's Centro Universitario de Estudios Cinematográficos. In 1978, he returned to Spain to work in Basque cinema. Eceiza has subsequently used the Basque spelling of his name in the film credits, Antxon Exeiza.",
