    "introduction": "A Sentimental Capitalism is a tragicomic tale on the extension of economic logic to art and love. The film chronicles the apprenticeship of Fernande Bouvier, a naive country girl, who, traveling from Paris to New York in 1929, from avant-garde Bohemia to the narrow circles of high finance, will loose a few illusions.A Sentimental Capitalism transports us to the Roaring Twenties, a baroque era of frenetic entertainments where no dream was too outrageous. In the heart of bohemian Paris, Fernande Bouvier (Lucille Fluet) meets Max Bauer (Paul Ahmarani) who introduces her to modern art, and Maria Rozanova (Sylvie Moreau) who teaches her to be wary of men. Soon Fernande’s dream of living as an artist has reduced her to working in a brothel. Meanwhile, in New York’s business circles, three men are also investing in the future: Victor Feldman (Alex Bisping), a stock market speculator, Charles Wilson (Frank Fontaine), a mine operator, and George Buchanan (Harry Standjofski), who works in the porcelain toilet trade. ‘It’s not the supply that matters,’ says Victor, ‘it’s the demand, and demand is created.’ Wilson and George bet him he can't sell Fernande, and he accepts the wager -- with unexpected and catastrophic results. Employing a dazzling visual style that mixes 1920s Expressionism with film noir and Dadaist photomontage, Olivier Asselin has made a timely meditation on the interactions of art, love and the stock market.",
