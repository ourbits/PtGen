    "introduction": "\"Molly's Theory of Relativity\" is a sexy, funny, surreal, and devastating portrait of a beautiful twenty-eight-year-old astronomer who, having unexpectedly lost her job, is poised to make perhaps the first reckless decision of her life. Her story unfolds during an eighteen-hour period, on Halloween. Providing counsel on the fateful day are her husband; her father-in-law; three deceased relatives; a precocious nine-year-old trick-or-treater; her grandfather from Minot, North Dakota; and a six-year-old neighbor, who may or may not be imaginary. \"Molly's Theory of Relativity\" is about the economy, and how we value what we do for a living, to ourselves and to others. It observes the unbreakable bonds of family, and posits the notion that death is merely a relative thing.",
