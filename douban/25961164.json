    "introduction": "Big Baby and his father are on the loose again and this time they take the treasures from the world that are associated with elements of the cosmos such as the Statue of Ra (representing the Sun) and other items that will allow them to travel into space. The young Baby Geniuses team is on its way to recapture the criminals and return the objects. Once again these talkative baby agents are filled with knowledge of the universe and are greater than the FBI. Although most adults cannot understand these adorable tots, there are a few that can help the baby squad analyze the information that the kids get to help solve the crimes.",
