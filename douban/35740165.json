    "introduction": "Amol Rajan explores the years following the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the positive media reaction to the emergence of a new generation of royals. The film charts the years leading up to and including the engagement and marriage of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. Providing context for the princes’ relationship with the media, the film examines some of the illegal activities engaged in by some newspapers in the late 1990s and early 2000s, including hacking and 'blagging', and how these techniques were used to target members of the royal family and their associates.",
