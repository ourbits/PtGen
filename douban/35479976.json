    "introduction": "Right-wing xenophobia rise in Hong Kong these few years. Narratives mold the ethics of a community. The Other(the Chinese title means strangers, from the Bible) mainly narrates in May 1962, plenty of refugees came to HK due to famine, students in Chung Chi College helped the refugees to reach the urban areas (so that they can register to be HK citizen). This story is cross-cut with the narratives that left-wing NGOs supporting mainland children of HK citizens and foreign domestic helpers fight for rights of abode. I use these narratives to proof my thesis, caring strangers and sojourners is an important value of HK, to resist the right-wing xenophobia. I try to make short film as writing thesis, to explore film form.",
