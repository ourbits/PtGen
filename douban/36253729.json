    "introduction": "Scotland, 1928. A remote coastal peninsula. A boy watches his parents as they decide whether to send their loyal working horse to the knacker's yard; he now costs much more to keep than he earns for a family who tread the tightrope between survival and ruin. A story of watching, and understanding. A boy watches his parents, and understands what it means to be an adult. A man watches his horse, and understands that all things must age and die. A woman watches her husband, and understands that frequently what breaks our hearts is what is necessary for survival.",
