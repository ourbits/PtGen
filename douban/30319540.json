    "introduction": "The rise and fall...and rise of Schlitzie, the lovable man-child performer from Tod Browning's cult film \"Freaks.\" He lived to perform, until he was put in an institution and left to die. His persona earned him a place in Punk history when the Ramones recorded \"Pinhead,\" dolls and jewelry were created in his image, and \"American Horror Story: Freakshow\" paid homage to him. According to sideshow lore, Schlitzie was one of the most beloved performers.",
