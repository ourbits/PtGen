    "introduction": "A “filmic ballad” in the heart of the city of Rio de Janeiro in which Angelica De Paula shares her daily life during the first lockdown. Her story and her songs evoke the domination and power relationships which materialize in bodies. It is in this form which they call “documentary dance” that Sacha Rey chooses to respond to the mutism of “necro-liberal” society which produces and makes invisible “sacrificable bodies” (F. Vergès).",
