    "introduction": "FM is set in a hip London radio station. The series follows a group of fame-hungry friends who run a daily indie-inspired show.Show host Lindsay Carol (O’Dowd) bumbles his way passionately through each show regaling his loyal listeners with a mixture of cutting edge tunes and stories of his totally misguided personal life. Sharp and witty on-air, off-air he’s all at sea in the world of hip bands and celebrity and constantly upstaged by fellow radio host and cool urban DJ, Topher Kiepher (O-T Fagbenle). Lindsay’s dipsy yet too-cool-for-rock school co-host Dom Cox (Bishop) manages to piss off their music guests on a daily basis, usually through excessive partying, his tardy antics and his general inability to take his job seriously. Lyndsay’s producer, Jane Edwards (Sosanya) is suppose to keep the hosts under control and running to schedules, but she very rarely achieves this herself. Like Lindsay and Dom, Jane is an eternal singleton and they all revel in each others dating disasters. Together they make for a very motley radio crew.",
