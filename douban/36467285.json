    "introduction": "This documentary attempts to make history by finding once and for all the lost city of Atlantis. Adventurer-geologist Dr. Martin Pepper sets out to prove his theory–that the true Atlantis existed on the Greek island of Santorini, and was destroyed in the biggest volcanic eruption in human history. He will use new scientific evidence–gathered using sonar scans of the sea bed, and microscopic analysis of the ancient landscape. But he must also match Santorini to a series of key clues embedded in the first-ever description of Atlantis by the Greek philosopher Plato–from the lost city's strange ring-shaped design to the role Egyptian priests played in recording the legend in the first place. His journey will take him across the Mediterranean and out into the Atlantic Ocean. By the end of the program, he reveals the stunning findings which may pinpoint the city and show exactly what it looked like.",
