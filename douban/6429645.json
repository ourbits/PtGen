Oma is horrified and finally decides to live out her dream of getting the blessing from the Bavarian Pope. She hops onto a flight to Rome and knocks on the door of Martina, her granddaughter who works as a nanny to a strict Catholic family. Or so everyone thought. Oma quickly faces many surprises: Martina lives with her boyfriend Silvio, a tattoo artist and rocker; her priest's letter granting access to a blessing won't work; a German restaurant serves food no one should ever call German; and, a blind man she helps, Lorenzo, isn't actually blind. Feeling disoriented, Oma begins a journey that will make her dreams, expected and unexpected, come true.",
