    "introduction": "Much of our population currently lives with hopeful delusions about climate change. These delusions, many of which are built in by evolution, hamper our ability to meaningfully address the problem. Emmy-nominated actor David Morse narrates the brutally honest 12th Hour, with insight from noted evolutionary biologists, climate scientists, cognitive researchers and psychologists. Our brains evolved to solve short-term challenges for our survival. Climate change is a long-term challenge to our survival. Can we bridge the gap between these modes of thinking?",
