    "introduction": "The film tells the story of the famous medieval Persian poet Rudaki who worked at the court of the Emir Nasr II. During this period, Rudaki fell in love with Nigina, a slave of commander Sahl bin Mansur. Sahl bin Mansour agreed to give his slave to Rudaki, but he later tricked him and killed Nigina. After the death of Nasr II, his son Nuh became Emir, and ordered to blind Rudaki. Rudaki, however, continued to write poetry and dictate them to his disciples.",
