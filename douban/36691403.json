    "introduction": "As the daughter of seminal Bengali critic, filmmaker and translator Chidananda Das Gupta, Aparna Sen was born into the art. Discovered at the age of sixteen by her father’s friend Satyajit Ray for a part in his Omnibus project Teen Kanya (1961), slowly but surely her career began. In the 70s, she became a key presence in Bengali and Hindi cinema, both in their more artistic as well as their more popular veins. In 1981, Sen directed her first fiction feature, 36 Chowringhee Lane. Today, fifteen films further down the road, she's one of the most prodigious female Indian filmmakers. In Parama – A Journey with Aparna Sen, Ghosh takes Sen on a journey to some of the locations where she shot her iconic films. Surprise sights and meetings, accompanied by stories from her nearest and dearest, this is a perfect introduction to one of world cinema's most important oeuvres!",
