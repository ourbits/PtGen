    "introduction": "Her first few years of life are much the same as any other infant; when she wasn't stuffing her face with lizard meat or playing push the boulder with her big sister, Cavegirl was picking the fleas from her Mother's beard. But by the time she was 11, Cavegirl realised she was different. Much to the anger of the tribe elders, it was obvious for all to see she was leaps ahead of her peers in the evolutionary scale. Cavegirl is quicker, wittier, stronger and much, much brighter and she knows it. As far as the resentful elders are concerned, little girls are supposed to cook the meat, not invent brilliant new ways to catch it. Written by Dan Peacock",
