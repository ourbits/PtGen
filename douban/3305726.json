    "introduction": "Inspired by true events, when 13-year-old Ray Moretti is caught trespassing at Yankee Stadium, his life changes in more ways than he could have ever dreamed. Both the new and old Yankee Stadiums provide the backdrop to this timeless tale featuring a race against time, ghosts of legends past, first loves, and the complex, yet rewarding relationship between father and son. This wish-fulfillment family film explores the magic behind the Yankees mystique and tells the real story of how they saved their inaugural 2009 season. You won't find it in any newspapers or history books or see it on Sports Center. There's no evidence to suggest what you will see in \"Keeper of the Pinstripes\" ever even happened ...but it did.",
