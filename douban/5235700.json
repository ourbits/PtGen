    "introduction": "《我的身体》导演声明在你进入这个黑暗之前我没有太多可说的。我拍这部电影的目的很简单，我只想成为我自己，而不必为自己感到羞耻。我记忆犹存，一个镜子面前的女人。看着镜中的自我。当镜子提醒你已不是你自己，微笑便不由自主消失。我拍了一部自画像。不仅仅是折射我自己，还有我的时光。我听到一种轻声细语。一种凝视在说话，说我背叛了我自己。但我只是努力去做一个诚实的人。诚实总是有它的空间。我们不必去回避它。如果你我都去努力，存在于我们之间的真实的成分会增长。我的真实不是唯一的真实。Margreth Olin | 挪威 | 2002 | 26 分钟 | 35毫米 | 挪威语配中英文字幕My BodyA brilliant documentary about body and identity.Norway has only a few filmmakers of international quality. Meaning: They are able to project their stories onto the big screen, in such a way that you know it couldn‚Äôt have been done much better anywhere else in the world. At least if such a statement can be based on some years of participating in film festivals in Norway and abroad. Margreth Olin is one of these.This documentary is called ‚ÄúMy Body‚Äù. She literally strips naked in front of the camera, wanting to tell the story of being her self. Today, a grown woman with obviously exceptional resources. But what and whom shaped the woman she has become, her identity and how she sees herself? Yes, this could easily have become mushy. Confessional literature‚Äôs huge weakness is that if one is not interested in the confessor or her story, it collapses completely. This is by no means the case here.Margreth Olin | Norway | 2002 | 26 minutes | 35mm | Norwegian with English & Chinese subtitles",
