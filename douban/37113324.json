    "introduction": "Unearthing. The Books We Didn't Inherit delves into the family memory of María Julia Blanco, the film's director. The exhumation of her father's student library, recovered in 2018, is the starting point. Julia guides us through the province of Santa Fe, following her family's story. Historian and bibliophile by choice, Julia takes as a starting point books, which on the surface do not divulge what has happened, to dig into family memory; little by little it becomes evident that in the remains of the books we see revealed both family history as well as Argentine history.",
