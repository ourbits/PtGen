    "introduction": "The Oldest Person in the World is a feature documentary that continuously documents each individual who holds the title of oldest living person. As the torch inevitably passes from one elder to the next, Sam Green (32 Sounds, The Weather Underground) spends 10 years traversing the globe to film each record holder. The result is a delightful and captivating film on a subject that fascinates people across countries and cultures. As the film unfolds, however, it transforms into a poignant meditation on the passage of time, the randomness of fate, and the joy and the profound human experience of being alive.",
