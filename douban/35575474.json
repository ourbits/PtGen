    "introduction": "The Peeters-Miller family is typically middle-class. The only thing that sets them apart is that they have decided together to end their lives. We witness the tenderness of their last evening and see them vacillate between self-determination and destiny; struggle with their anxieties about the future of mankind and climate issues. Big questions are addressed: 'What is the meaning of life?' 'Why do we cling to life like this?' Family is a film about defiance: let's live. Let's make this world our home, together, against the odds.",
