    "introduction": "The Sleeping Beauty is one of the all-time great ballets for too many reasons to list. While the story is somewhat thin it still manages to captivate, while the music by Tchaikovsky is the very definition of magical. This production from The Royal Ballet is a good one, but somewhat of a disappointment, mainly because their versions of Swan Lake and The Nutcracker are classics and in some areas I found that the production fell short.",
