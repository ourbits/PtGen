    "introduction": "FOUR DAYS AT OCOEEShut four days long in the narrow space of recording studio, under the gaze of a few privileged witnesses, two men, two musicians, of very different culture, find themselves obliged, in order for something to happen, to build together « common ground». That is a musical and mental scape where they would both agree to play together.Four days at Ocoée is the tale of this musical and human experience, of this tension, this quest, where music is alternatively the reflection of an interior landscape, the disclosure of inner conflicts, the drive of transformation, and the place of reconciliation. But isn’t a successful artistic process always a land of utopia too?",
