Running away from the hotel, she tries to call for help, but no one notices her. After a few days, all doubts flutter. Lera's body is fished out of a flooded quarry. Is she really dead? If so, why is she still walking among the living? And why can only a few people actually see it? And why exactly are they? She will have to find answers - dead or alive.",
