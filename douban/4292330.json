Although Miranda is atheist, she can't deny Steve's entire Catholic family having the baby baptized. Just when Carrie felt down having to write about relationships without having one herself, she gets invited by a publisher to select some of her columns as a book. Eternally positive Charlotte drags Carrie along to the Fountain of Faith, but stands up to say faith didn't suffice for her.",
