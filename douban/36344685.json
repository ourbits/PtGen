    "introduction": "Ghost Play is a tribute to the disappearance of the cinema we loved and its cinematic space. A boy goes to the theater with his grandfather. The theater always rescreens old classic films. The shabbiness of the physical properties of the film, such as cathode ray tubes, screens, videos, and films, are linked to the traces of time imprinted in the declining theater, such as old wallpapers, peeling paint, and smeared watermarks. Movies are unpredictable—they are cut off and then rescreened, the same scenes are repeated, and the beginning becomes the end, and the end becomes the beginning. Looking closely at the things that are disappearing and crumbling and the strata of that time. The process of rebuilding them is intertwined, like a movie in different editions or a game of hide-and-seek between a runaway soldier and a boy.
