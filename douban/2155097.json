    "introduction": "The film's orginality lies in its strong graphical effects: he did the drawings with a paintbrush and introduced areas of colour in patches with brush strokes, straight onto the celluloid. His technique superseded the conventional 'hard' figures since the manipulation of the patches of colour diffused the outlines of the characters.",
