In an interview before the finale of the thirty-sixth season, Phil Keoghan stated, \"We know the audience loves the airports; we know the audience loves mixing things up. We know that the audience loves going to new places, like Slovenia in Season 35. We got so much great feedback about Slovenia, so expect to see some new destinations, and also trying some new things.\"Filming for this season began on May 18, 2024. Fourteen teams of two will compete in a race around the world to win US$1,000,000.",
