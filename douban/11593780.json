On the last day of August, his closest friends arrive unannounced to confront him about his recent reclusive and self-destructive behavior. Wanting to support him, yet skeptical of his psychological health, they attempt the tight-rope walk of loving confrontation in the hopes of convincing Dan to return home. Friendships are tested and love reveals itself in this independent drama about breaking down and breaking through.",
