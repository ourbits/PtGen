    "introduction": "Transparencies: seeing through, being able to glimpse the “cinema” on foot, or carried. Eye and hand become movement, claws and projection. On the decomposition of nitrate material, its transformations (of a fragment of war that belonged to Luca Comerio, shot by him in 1916 on Mount Adamello). Constantly changing physical appearance. There remain the supports torn from the film: perforations, collages, fluorescences, faded colors, until the original image contained in the photogram is completely erased. Erasure of the image of war; relationship between nitrate and gunpowder. Metamorphoses of “running” cinema into cinema of sticky, gummy, explosive matter. Last state of cinema: becoming an incendiary explosive bomb of memory.",
