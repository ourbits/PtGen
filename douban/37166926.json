    "introduction": "Marie, her father and her little brother live in an underground bunker hidden deep in the woods. The world as we knew it no longer exists. When the father accidentally shoots a stranger while on a hunt, he sees himself faced with only two options. At home, Marie tends to the wounds of the unconscious man. While the father distrusts the stranger, Marie is drawn to him. For her, the bunker feels not like a home but a prison from which she yearns to break free. Can this stranger be her long awaited hope? But when three marauders invade the bunker, Marie is not sure what or who her new friend really is.",
