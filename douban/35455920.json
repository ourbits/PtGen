    "introduction": "Starting from the life of the filmmaker Julio García Espinosa, the documentary is projected towards a reflection on the emergence and development of Cuban revolutionary cinematography, its struggles, contradictions and confrontations with dogmatic thinking that at times seems to dominate the Cuban political-cultural spectrum, the always difficult, risky and necessary relationship between officials and artists, and the close and united defense of filmmakers around their film policy.",
