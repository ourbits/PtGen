    "introduction": "Francoise Sagan (1935-2004) wrote her first novel Bonjour Tristesse (Hello, Sadness) at the age of 18, that was an immediate international success. During the following years she wrote several novels and plays, and became one of the icons of French literary life. This rare film is directed by Francoise Sagan and based on one of her plays. It's a love story, including 3 or 4 other love stories, set in a park a winter's day. The excellent prefromance of old woman is played by Alice Reichen.In 1979 her short film Another Winter wins the New York Film Festival. She serves as the president of the Cannes film festival jury that same year and complains in an interview that the jury was pressured to vote for Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now. In 1980 she begins seeing Jean Paul Satre regularily and continues to do so until his death. She compiles a collection of plays and memoirs over the next ten years. Her political convictions continue to appear as she joins Mitterand's support group and publishes yet another scathing editorial in Le Monde in 1985.",
