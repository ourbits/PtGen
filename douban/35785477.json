    "introduction": "The course of an immigrant’s life, as narrated by himself through a parcel of 120 postcards and photos, is transformed into a documentation of an entire nation’s uprooting. Through the real keepsakes of an expatriate, Lakis Papastathis deciphers a life of uprooting, delivering a spectacular cinema document that portrays the experience of nostalgia in an original and deeply humane manner.",
