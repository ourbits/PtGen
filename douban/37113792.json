Or that three people once lost their lives thanks to a falling poodle? Have you heard of the island off the coast of Mexico that’s populated by thousands of mutilated dolls? What about the prison where inmates sometimes wake up…with a new set of goat testicles?If you haven’t, then brace yourself for The UnBelievable with Dan Aykroyd.Each hour-long episode will open up our cabinet of curiosities to reveal the strangest-but-true stories in human history, brought to life through dynamic recreation, compelling graphics, and arresting archival.
