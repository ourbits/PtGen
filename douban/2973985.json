    "introduction": "Recently visited the home of Edvard Greig's home in Norway and always remembered his \"Peer Gynt Suite\" from music appreciation in school, especially the \"Morning\" song. This is an outstanding 1941 film starring a very young Charlton Heston, (Peer Gynt) around the age of 15 or 17 years of age and a great gem of a film that I have never seen before. The entire story of Peer Gynt along with the musical score by Edvard Greig is portrayed with great acting by Charlton Heston and a great cast of outstanding actors. The character of Peer Gynt is nothing you would be proud of and he was a reckless heartless individual who treated all women very poorly and only in a sexual way. In other words, Peer Gynt was a love'em and leave'em type of person who only thought of himself and no one else. Peer Gynt travels the entire world seeking fortunes and lost causes and finally comes home to Norway and settles down. The film location for this film was in Northern Illinois and Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, and you have to read English Titles throughout the film. Enjoy.",
