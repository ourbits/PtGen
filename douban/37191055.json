    "introduction": "Teresa is a surfer who lives a full love life until the day when using an app that allows surfers to analyze the state of the sea in real time, she realizes that something strange is happening on the beach. Intrigued by what she sees in the images, Teresa is faced with a decision that has been on hold for too long. At the same time, she realizes how she might not accept for others what she claims for herself. \"It's harder to be true to one's own nature... than to fight it\" (La Collectionneuse, Eric Rohmer, 1967).* The film had Agnès Varda's estate's permission to use an excerpt from Varda's \"Le Bonheur\" (1965).",
