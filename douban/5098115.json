From the moment Mickey Mouse appeared on the big screen whistling on a steamboat, Walt Disney's endearing little mouse captured hearts and tickled bones. And he hasn't stopped. Now, in celebration of the world's most famous and best-loved character, his best friends - Minnie, Donald, Goofy and the gang - present Mickey through the years in his most memorable movie shorts. From Mickey's color debut in \"The Band Concert,\" to the never-before-released-on-video \"Orphan's Picnic\" and \"Mickey's Surprise Party,\" to the inspired \"Mickey and the Seal,\" The Spirit of Mickey is an engaging collection of Mickey's best and brightest.",
