    "introduction": "unfortunately, the film is just far too boring and less than half the way through, my mind began to wander. The plot is very thin and simple, and we just; as usual, focus on crime in the city, and this time a vigilante that takes the law into his own hands. However, in spite of it being simple; director Carlo Ausino has somehow managed to completely mess the plot up. It's confusing and turgid throughout, and this makes it very difficult to care about anything that's going on. This is not George Hilton's best performance either; and I can't say I blame him for not giving his all. There's very little action, and when the car chases and things do finally make an appearance; they're not well shot and unlikely to wake the sleeping audience. Overall, I'm really quite appalled at how bad this film is, and needless to say I'm not looking forward to Another Double Game.",
