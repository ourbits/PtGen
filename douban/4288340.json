    "introduction": "This film by writer/director Andras Jeles was completed in 1983 but was not released until several years later. It tells the story of a \"worker's brigade\" attempting to produce a play by a Soviet writer for the Hungarian stage. Their conversations about censorship and brutal law enforcement may have had something to do with the difficulty Álombrigád had being released. There are also many side discussions about the nature of the arts, philosophy and drama in the end always revolving around the life of the brigade, the socialist workers and the 'Comrades above them'. Jeles in this movie operates with broken narrative and a surreal associations and is considered to be an outstanding director of Hungarian cinema of the 70's and 80's after his experimental approaches on redefining the way stories are told on celluloid.",
