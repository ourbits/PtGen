As though balancing her mental health and relationships wasn’t hard enough, tension rises when she’s promoted in her male-dominant industry with demanding expectations and delinquent coworkers. Stress rises to an all-time high, and cold reminders of her past begin knocking to find their way in while she struggles to find day-to-day happiness. Together, obstacles culminate until everything comes tumbling down.In a humble and heartbreaking journey, Mya embodies just how complicated, tiring, and lonely it can be to feel just a little self-love.",
