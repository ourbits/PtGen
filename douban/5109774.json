    "introduction": "In NOBODY'S BUSINESS, Alan Berliner takes on his reclusive father as the reluctant subject of this poignant and graceful study of family history and memory. What emerges is a uniquely cinematic biography that finds both humor and pathos in the swirl of conflicts and affections that bind father and son. Ultimately this complex portrait is a meeting of the minds: where the past meets the present, where generations collide and where the boundaries of family life are pushed, pulled, stretched, torn and, surprisingly at times, also healed.",
