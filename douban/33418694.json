    "introduction": "While his previous film addressed the question of rural life via the major health crisis of the 20th century (mad cow disease) and in the form of a fiction (Bloody Milk, César for Best First Film 2018), here Hubert Charuel recounts the transformations in this way of life, from a personal point of view. When his father retires, Hubert’s mother needs to adapt her way of working and how the herd of cows is managed. She will have to move them to an industrial ultra-modern farm. Hubert films. COWS WITH NO NAME is almost a diary, filmed one day at a time, of each stage of this process, documenting the operation of the farm with critical and incisive humour. But it is also an intimate documentary. By filming scenes of daily life on the family farm, around the kitchen table during meals, or in front of the TV in the evening while everyone falls asleep on the sofa, more personal questions are raised: the farmer’s connection to his herd, or even the handover that Hubert has chosen not to ensure.",
