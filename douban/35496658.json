    "introduction": "曹斐 伦敦蛇形画廊个展：蓝图 Blueprints首次展出The Eternal Wave，2020，Virtual realityProduced in collaboration with Acute ArtThe Eternal Wave is Cao Fei's first virtual reality work and uses the spaces of the Hongxia Theatre's kitchen as its backdrop. The experience begins in a physical rendition  of a stage set that the artist designed for her film, Nova, which was based on the theatre's original kitchen. From this starting point, the visitor embarks on a multi-sensory journey through various portals, traversing the boundaries between time and space to explore the computers of the early electronics industry in China and the areas in and around the Hongxia Theatre. The title of the work is taken from the 1958 film directed by Wang Ping, which focuses on the story of an underground CPC telegrapher, and is a key reference within the plotline of Nova.虚拟现实VR作品《永不消逝的电波》由Acute Art与艺术家联合制作，将首次亮相于\"蓝图\"个展当中。《永不消逝的电波》，一个为特定场域创作和制作的VR装置，是以曹斐北京工作室的一角为背景，以HX项目档案材料和家具组成，以及包含她的最新电影《新星》。这三个相互关联的作品内容标志着曹斐在过去五年里对北京进行的广泛研究的汇总，考察了她所生活和工作的城市酒仙桥（红霞）地区的社会历史和城市转型。。“蓝图”探索了曹斐如何在现实和虚拟时空中创造多维世界的能力，并从中呈现出中国及其他不同地区城市景观的变化。",
