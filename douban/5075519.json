    "introduction": "A friend of Dick Bailey is killed by a mysterious assailant, whom Dick suspects to be Stack, who is in league with the crooked sheriff. Out on a spree Dick swears he will marry the first woman he sees, who happens to be Ruth Hammond, sister of his dead friend, arriving to take charge of the Hammond ranch. Revolted by his rough proposal,she fires him as the Hammond foreman and she proceeds to the ranch. Stack informs her he has purchased the ranch for the payment of the back-due taxes, and she relents and rehires Dick and his friends to aid her in her fight against Stack.From the books of legendary American writer Zane Grey comes Light Of The Western Stars, a classic tale of corruption and redemption in the old west! When cowpoke Dick Bailey (Richard Arlen) sees his best friend and employer Pie Pan Hammond shot down by a mysterious assassin, he suspects that the crooked sheriff may be making a move to steal his friend's land. Matters are complicated further when Bailey, out on a bender, pledges to marry the first woman he sees, who just happens to be Hammond's sister Ruth, who has arrived in town to take over her brother's ranch. At first, Ruth shuns Bailey's affections, but soon finds that she needs his help to fight off the ruthless Sheriff and his gang of outlaws before they take over the family ranch! With unbound action and fiery romance, The Light Of Western Stars is a western classic for the entire family!",
