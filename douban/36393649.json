    "introduction": "Two brothers in Donbas, younger Kolya and older Kostya, have a different view of what is going on and what each of them should do next. Kolya backs the rebellion. Regardless of the punishment and risks, he regularly protests against the war in the centre of his hometown and, because of it, he is regularly interrogated by the secret service. Kostya is the practical one. He wants both brothers to leave the region, find work and perspectives for a better future. The tension between them is escalating, even more so because the conflict about the war is not the only one dividing them. ‘Shreds’ shows Russia’s war against Ukraine from a less obvious and more personal perspective that the one presented by the media every day.源自：https://www.krakowfilmfestival.pl/en/online-cinema/film/4067/",
