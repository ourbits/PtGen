    "introduction": "A former Bay City cop tries to keep his failing P. I. business alive, and his loyal assistant employed, by finding and returning a piece of very expensive jewelry for a fabulously wealthy and beautiful client. She's the first client he's had in a long time but Philip discovers that there is far more to her story than she told him. Most puzzling of all, the police don't want him to follow this case or the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of his late wife. The deeper he goes into this case, the clearer it becomes that everyone with whom he comes in contact has a secret.",
