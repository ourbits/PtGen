    "introduction": "One of the best from the series of Beckett on Film.Endgame was written (by Samuel Beckett) in French in 1957. Hamm, who is blind and unable to walk, and Clov, Hamm's servant, occupy 'a bare interior'. Nagg and Nell, Hamm's parents, are in dustbins in a corner, and sometimes pop up to talk. Clov looks out of the two small windows with a telescope. The world outside seems dead and grey. Daily rituals are performed ad nauseam. 'Why this farce, day after day?' asks Nell. Hamm and Clov have both 'had enough'. They repeatedly discuss whether or not Clov will leave, and why he stays. Hamm asks Clov to kill him, but he won't. However, Nell dies. Finally, Clov says he's leaving once again and returns 'dressed for the road', but he stands watching Hamm until the curtain falls.Synopsis most from:http://www.beckettonfilm.com/plays/endgame/synopsis.htmlScripthttp://samuel-beckett.net/endgame.htmlOther useful link:http://web.channel4.com/learning/main/netnotes//programid1680.htm",
