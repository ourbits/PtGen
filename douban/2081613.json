    "introduction": "A modern Cinderella story set in New York City's Chinatown, Year of the Fish is a classic tale retold through the eyes of a young woman struggling to find a new life in the United States. Director David Kaplan has gathered an all-star cast, filmed them in live action, and then applied an algorithmic painting technology to achieve the rotoscoped animation. The result? Year of the Fish pops from the screen like a painting come to life. This is the level of originality we've come to expect from Kaplan--Sundance audiences may remember him for short films of fairy tales reconceived in a unique style all his own.Although Year of the Fish is best described as an adult fairy tale, make no mistake: this story is a deep one. It tackles the realities of immigration and the frighteningly common occurrence of young people who, desperate for a better life, fall prey to an existence as indentured servants. This dark story becomes instantly palatable when wrapped in Kaplan's lovely package--a tribute to his storytelling talent. Year of the Fish is beautiful to witness and as ironically mysterious as the American dream itself.--© Sundance Film Festival",
