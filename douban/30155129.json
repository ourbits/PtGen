    "introduction": "With wounds still open from the recent end of their 5 year relationship, Drew and Beth decide to meet up for a quiet dinner at Drew's apartment to help solidify their newly found station as \"just friends\". Through a haze of wine, cigarettes, and uninhibited honesty, Hello & Goodbye follows the ex-lovers as they confront years of issues in one night. Reaching a level of intimacy they never could in their relationship, both sexually and emotionally, and smearing the line between the two. They examine themselves, each other, and where it all went wrong when there are no good guys or no bad. What is love? And is it enough to get them through the night?",
