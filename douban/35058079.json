    "introduction": "A convicted extortionist discovers that he's the last human being on Earth. As he struggles with his newly inherited solitude, he reflects on the events that led to the mysterious disappearances of his two children, ex-wife, and the remainder of the world's populace. He wonders - was it a military attack? Was it an alien attack? Or could it be that he is the victim of some form of cosmic justice. His denial of a moral universe leads him to consider sudden termination. He rejects eternal consequences and scoffs at divine salvation. Instead, he seeks deliverance at the end of a loaded revolver. Is this the end to his story? Or will fate force him to taste his own medicine, and prove that there are some things in this life that are worse than death. Written by Raffaele DiBacco",
