    "introduction": "Based on the New York Times best-selling Christmas novel by Wally Lamb comes the new Christmas classic, starring Molly Ringwald and featuring Chevy Chase as the narrator. Set in the 1960s, \"Wishin’ and Hopin’\" is the story of 10-year-old Felix Funicello (Wyatt Ralff, \"The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby\"), who is doing his best to navigate fifth grade at St. Aloysius Gonzaga Parochial School. His father (Danny Nucci, \"The Fosters\") runs the local diner, and their family’s claim to fame is their cousin, Annette Funicello (Krysta Rodriguez, \"Smash\"), the famous teen star and Mouseketeer. With the dreaded Christmas pageant on the horizon, the holiday season gets even more exciting with the sudden arrivals of a substitute teacher (Ringwald) and a feisty Russian student, Zhenya, and promises to be one Christmas Felix will never forget. Also stars Meat Loaf (\"Fight Club\"), Annabella Sciorra (\"CSI\"), Cheri Oteri (\"Saturday Night Live\"), Conchata Ferrell (\"Two and a Half Men\") and Camila Banus (\"Days of Our Lives\").",
