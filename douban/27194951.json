    "introduction": "During the Blitz more than 450,000 bombs dropped on Britain - and every bomb has its own story.This series examines the specific effect of four bombs, from their initial impact on individual lives, right through to their wider consequences for the Second World War and all the way to the present day. Each episode begins with a single bomb in a single street in a single place: London, Hull, Clydebank and Bristol.Across the series incredible personal testimony, gut-wrenching memoirs, and the meticulous records kept at the time, provide a visceral and terrifying account of the Blitz that directly connects with the human experience of the bombs. As survivors and relatives attest, these bombs touched the lives of everyone and created a legacy we all still live with today.",
