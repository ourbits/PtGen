    "introduction": "A woman and her young toddler escape the city to a small coastal town. She checks in to a run-down motel by the sea. Burdened by a troubled past, she hangs on vulnerably by a thread. As night approaches, ghastly occurrences haunt her movements and actions as she prepares for a horrific act. However, a chance encounter with a stranger changes the course of events. Like her, the stranger harbors a burden of his own and their meeting brings to surface their deeply buried emotions and hope/fear for the future, culminating in a beautiful, redemptive and serendipitous ending.源自：https://jaff-filmfest.org/my-mother-at-the-beach/",
