    "introduction": "典型的早期日式朋克电影，黑白影像+连续而晃动的手提摄影+朋克乐，石井当年就是以此片出道的。。。This extremely hectic and nearly headache-inducing short by the Japanese punk demigod Sogo Ishii is definitely one of the craziest and most experimental art-house movies I ever had the pleasure of seeing on a big screen (during a special revolving on the director).After the two hugely different but already influential long-feature films \"Panic High School\" and \"Crazy Thunder Road\", Ishii finally made the punk-short he clearly dreamed of making ever since the beginning. \"Shuffle\" is based on comic strip and doesn't really have a story to tell. The camera just very creatively follows a man as he's running out of his apartment and down the streets. He's running from the cops, because he murdered his girlfriend, but he's also running towards the pimp who stole her from him, for vengeance. 30 minutes of playtime only to depict a man running down some streets seems long, but Ishii somehow manages to make it fascinating by presenting a non-stop series of imaginative camera tricks, lighting techniques and unique sound-editing. The visuals are groundbreaking and far ahead of their time. The colors continuously fade out and back in, the camera is put in every possible perspective there is and the music is really loud and stimulating. \"Shuffle\" often looks like an exercise for Ishii's next big project \"Burst City\" and it definitely was a great source of influence for future Asian filmmakers like Takashi Miike and Shinya Tsukamoto. You can't really call it a great film, because there are almost no dialogs or character drawings, but it surely guarantees half a hour of adrenalin-rushing spectacle.",
