Why else will he call her so late into the night even though he knows that she is a married woman now, he asks her. Aalo tries to assuage his suspicions but in vain. Throughout this fight, she is also cooking his lunch and helping him prepare for office. At work, his colleague Mr Chatterji understands that Abir has fought with his wife again. He asks him to make up with her. On the way back, Abir buys Aalo's favorite fish - ilish. But is it too late to say sorry? Watch the Indraneil Sengupta and Ankita Chakraborty starrer Shorshe Ilish to find out.",
