    "introduction": "This b/w film shows the difficult way of a family with six boys to get an economical deliverance from the oppressing conditions they lived until now. The story plays in Switzerland and is well placed in the years after 2nd world war, when lots of people in central Europe lived without great perspectives and where mindfully looking to create better conditions for the family. The series are produced carefully, the actors - only several ones are professionals - played with great conviction. The series where showed only in Switzerland, but with much success, so the producers had the idea to cut from the whole material a motion picture film who was showed also with success.",
