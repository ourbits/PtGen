    "introduction": "Of all the ancient civilizations, Egypt has left the greatest legacy. Its monuments all evoke one indisputable truth: Early Egyptians were obsessed with death and the afterlife. On papyrus rolls and tomb walls, they recorded spells to help the deceased pass all the tests and creatures they would encounter in the underworld. These recordings were known as the Book of the Dead. But what if this book is hiding something deeper about these ancient Egyptian beliefs? The answers could lie within one unique artifact.",
