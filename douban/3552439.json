He talks with his dad about it who rambles on and tells Norman, \"don't make waves\". At the party, Norman talks with his lampshade-clad friend Leo, disapproves of a joke told by one of the guests suspecting it's about a \"minority group\" and is ridiculed by the bartender for only having a ginger ale. Norman leaves the party and returns us to the multicolored rock group.",
