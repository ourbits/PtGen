    "introduction": "Coward is a moving and insightful drama that takes us from the idyllic pastures of Ireland to the brutal and senseless trenches of the First World War, as Private Patterson tries to keep a family promise to look after his younger cousin. A promise that proves near impossible to fulfill in the relentless and hellish onslaught of the battlefields of 1917 Belgium. Courage and commitment collide in a story, inspired by real events, that underscores the tragic nature of war and illustrates how justice can often be a casualty of warfare.",
