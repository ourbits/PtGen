    "introduction": "The drama camp of a high school class. The troubled Milán (18) is preparing for his own performance on the side. A love triangle starts to form between him, Anna and Dani. The tension peaks during an escape on a hike, after which all three of them are sent home. The triangle is left without resolution and the performance never takes place. A year later, following their graduation, the camp takes place again. Milán is no longer with them: he took his own life during the last semester. His classmates remember him and struggle to process his loss. Anna proposes to put together the performance that Milán wanted to create. Dani and Anna’s love can finally be fulfilled. The film aims to touch upon the current crisis of teenagers. It was created in an independent setting with the involvement of a couple of dozen youngsters – with, about, and for them.源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/summer-to-come/",
