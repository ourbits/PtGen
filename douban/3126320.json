    "introduction": "A strongly lyrical, quasi-balladic black-and-white piece that acquaints us with fragments of the lives of people from a small village hidden in the depths of the Bohemian Forest. The characters appear to move about in a state of timelessness; their inner solitude, frustrated desires, and the sense that they are condemned to perpetual wandering do not inspire hope that they will find a way out. The visually powerful leitmotif of the sylvan labyrinth, in which paths disappear between the tall trees or beneath a mantle of snow, thus acquires symbolic value. News of the outbreak of World War I at the end of the film only heightens the bleakness of the message conveyed by documentarist Ivan Vojnár in his feature film directorial debut.源自：https://www.kviff.com/en/programme/film/63/38970-the-way-through-the-bleak-woods",
