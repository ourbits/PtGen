    "introduction": "A “visual social research” on Santorini that lays its sight on the period when the agricultural economy was gradually replaced by the swarming tourism industry. The movie exceeds the limitations of a simple folklore documentary, weaving a haunting portrait of a two-tier society, like the ominous vision of a future that had already arrived. A unique encounter between two great directors that has secured its prestigious place in the collection of New York’s Museum of Modern Art.",
