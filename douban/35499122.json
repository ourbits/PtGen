    "introduction": "Centered on the remarkable letters by José Lezama Lima to his sister living in exile in the United States, this feature length documentary \"Letters to Eloísa\" tells the story of the Cuban writer’s life and work; weaving together the public and the private, the literary and the political, ultimately to focus how the writer’s voice, at first amplified by the revolution’s cultural policies, was ultimately silenced by the absence of creative freedom in Cuba during its most tumultuous decades; beginning with the publication of his literary masterpiece \"Paradiso\", a novel with a strong homoerotic content that clashed with the government’s contemporaneous campaign of institutional homophobia.",
