    "introduction": "The sole survivor of an American raid on her small, northern Iraq village, young Turkmen Cennet (Suzan Genç) sets out to locate her brother in Turkey, and falls under the influence of a religious tyrant who uses her as a pawn in a deadly power struggle. Over the course of one harrowing night, Cennet watches in horror as everything she ever knew is destroyed. Upon arriving in Kirkuk to be with her brother Azim, a local barber, Cennet learns that he has been transported to Turkey for treatment after being badly injured in a bomb blast. Now Cennet's only hope of getting into Turkey is though the mountains of northern Iraq. Though a pair of smugglers agrees to help Cennet make the journey, the trip takes a dark turn when one of them forces himself upon her, and she is subsequently saved from committing suicide by a group of radical Islamists. Sympathetic to her plight, they help to ensure her safe arrival in Istanbul, where her desperate search for Azim hits a dead end. But Cennet's journey has just begun, because when the leader of the Islamic group realizes she's got nothing left to live for, he convinces her that by becoming a martyr she will live forever. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi",
