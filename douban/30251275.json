    "introduction": "This three-part BBC Four documentary series explores the enchanting story of our childhood reading and how the magical interplay of words and pictures forms and shapes our young imagination.Part One - When We Were Very YoungThe first episode looks at our very first books and the picture-book heaven that they create for under-fives.It features favourites from The Tale of Peter Rabbit to Charlie and Lola, from Noddy to Thomas the Tank Engine, plus modern classics such as We're Going on a Bear Hunt and Each Peach Pear Plum.There are also interviews, readings and demonstrations of their art from leading writers and illustrators including Michael Rosen, Shirley Hughes, Alan Ahlberg and Lauren Child.Part Two - Now We Are SixFrom the age of six we want books to make sense of the middle years of our childhood as we go to school and make new friendships - a time when we love books full of fantastical worlds, a comforting place of talking animals, but also a frightening one of wild woods and giants.The episode explores over 150 years of classic books, from Alice in Wonderland to The Wind in the Willows, from Winnie the Pooh to The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.There are interviews, readings and demonstrations of their art from leading writers and illustrators such as Philip Pullman, Jacqueline Wilson, Anthony Horowitz, Quentin Blake and Raymond Briggs.Part Three - Now We Are Growing UpThis episode looks at books that help us with the growing pains of our early adolescence and teens.Though words on the page begin to dominate, we still need strong visual imagery in books to understand darker and more complex worlds, as the magical interplay of words and pictures continues into early adulthood.Books explored here include Treasure Island, Swallows and Amazons, Lord of the Rings, Stig of the Dump, Tracey Beaker, Northern Lights and Artemis Fowl.There are interviews, readings and demonstrations of their art from leading writers and illustrators including Philip Pullman, Jacqueline Wilson, Eoin Colfer, David Almond, Ralph Steadman and Dave McKean.",
