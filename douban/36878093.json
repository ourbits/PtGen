Even in the year he thought was his last, Dong-ju is at a loss as he doesn't know what to do next. Dong-ju feels that even the worries and attention of the people around her are like pressure on her and leaves Seoul as if she were running away. Dong-ju looks back on his life as he reunites with his past ties and meets again by chance.",
