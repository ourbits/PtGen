    "introduction": "This is an odd film that is both engaging and sometimes off-putting at the same time and, perhaps because of my own art student years, also spoke to me on several levels. Tim Swain is Joe, an innocent adrift from Bangor, Maine - the home of Stephen King. During his opening narration, he remarks that his high school art teacher told him that, in addition to attending art classes, he must also experience as much of the world as possible. This he does, and more.",
