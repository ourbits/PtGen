    "introduction": "A young man desperately tries to hold together his fractured family and his own paradise in the Faroe Islands in a poignant and visually stunning small-town drama.Kári is a soft-spoken romantic living a quiet life on a remote archipelago in the North Atlantic. While his friends plan to leave a place with no apparent future, Kári does everything he can to keep the remnants of his family and small community intact. He struggles with his rebellious teenage sister, falls in love with a girl whose ambitions exceed his own, and desperately tries to maintain the normalcy that existed before his mother passed away. When the local fish factory faces closure, Kári watches both his own and his community's last lifeline slip away. Sakaris Stórá gently carves out the story of a man determined to stay while everyone else flees the place he considers his little paradise.",
