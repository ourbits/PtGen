    "introduction": "Married father of four, Jean-Gabriel is a TV weatherman. And for Christmas this year, he’s decided to take the wife and kids on a family ski holiday. But Jean-Gabriel’s organizational skills are put to the test in a big way when his teenagers decide they have better things to do and would rather not go; his very pushy, intrusive mother turns up unannounced from the Antilles with a pig; his best buddy Jojo asks him to look after his beloved Hummer; and to top it all off, his wife announces she has to stay behind and take care of her ailing father, a semi-disabled military vet who has refused to see her ever since she got married. But to Jean-Gabriel, family is sacred. And so is Christmas. Even if that means reconciling the irreconcilable !",
