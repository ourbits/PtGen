    "introduction": "After the New York and Madrid attacks, the international communities need for closer co-operation and shared intelligence has led to the creation of the European Intelligence Agency. The EIA, established by the European Union to combat terrorism, has field offices in every EU member state and must have at least half of its staff recruited domestically. In Dublin, Mark Keane is the first Irish agent to be recruited to the EIA. A former Irish Army Ranger, he is keen to prove himself but finds his career frustrated by Director Mason a former British Intelligence spy-master who doesn't place any faith in the inexperienced Keane. Three days before a secret EU Summit in Dublin, top international assassins start appearing in Dublin and a top EIA scientist goes missing, Keane eager to finally see some action, soon finds himself in the middle of an elaborate and dangerous plot. Written by Brendan Maguire",
