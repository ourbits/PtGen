Their last hours as civilians and conscripts: one last swim together with the boys, and then off to the train platform and the trains that will take them to their units – an atmosphere of exaltation, rebellion, nostalgia... A study of the last moments of freedom. The film was not released until 1989.Director and screenplay: Grzegorz Królikiewicz, Cinematography: Stanisław Niedbalski, Witold Stok, Jacek Tworek.",
