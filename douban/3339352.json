    "introduction": "Writer-poet Péter Dobai sketches out a portrait of a remarkable young man in this short documentary made in BBS. The protagonist lives according to a precisely determined philosophy: every spare minute is devoted to establishing a physical-spiritual equilibrium. Each day he works out for three hours and then reads philosophical tracts in order to polish the mind. Based on the classical ideal of man, he strives for nothing less than human perfection. However, at a key moment in the report we suddenly glimpse this young man’s desperate loneliness and vulnerability.",
