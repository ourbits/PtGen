At the age where other kids are making friends at school, Rachel was watching education videos at home. After Rachel grew up, she fell in love with a guy called Nick on social media, despite they don't really know each other in reality. Everything’s great until Nick starts to ask Rachel out to meet in person. However, it's not actually a good news for Rachel. On one hand, she has no idea about who this person is underneath the fancy social media posts, on the other hand, she is worried that her social anxiety disorder might let him down. In order to prevent that, Rachel puts an effort to become a better person. Soon, it's time for their first date. Rachel arrived at the restaurant, and she surprisingly finds Nick communicates with sign language. He might be imperfect elsewhere, but he's perfect for Rachel.",
