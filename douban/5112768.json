    "introduction": "“Age of the Gods” asks a fundamental question: can the aesthetical and the political be separated? Dammbeck had begun to study Arno Breker while he was working on the “Herakles-Konzept”. The sculptor and protégé of Adolf Hitler had established some ties to the fringes of the art world in the FRG with various portrait commissions, including for Ernst Jünger and Peter Ludwig. The film goes on to ask what power-political transformations do to art, how fascist symbols can regain their aesthetic innocence and how much opportunism is found in “pure” art. This is where Dammbeck emerges as the great chronicler of the German relationship between art and power.",
