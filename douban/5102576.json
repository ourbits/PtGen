Meanwhile, his wife has won a new car on a television quiz show that is the same make and model as the car Pete purchases from a car-dealer. Pete arrives home and sees the car his wife won and mistakes it for the one he ordered from the dealer, but it is a different color. He drives it back to the showroom for a replacement, and that begins the first of many problems he is to encounter.",
