    "introduction": "“The cinematic spectacle has its rules, which enable one to produce satisfactory products. But dissatisfaction is the reality that must be taken as a point of departure. Whether dramatic or documentary, the cinema functions to present a false, isolated coherence as a substitute for communication and an activity that are absent. To demystify documentary cinema it is necessary to dissolve what is called its subject matter.” In this fascinating, seminal anti-film, Guy Debord articulates in full flesh his situationist manifesto, superimposing subtitles and a documentary-style commentary on a catalog of newsreel footage, book covers, rephotographed photographs, views of Paris’ neighborhoods, and seemingly candid footage of him and his friends in wandering between cafes and the street. Whereas the conventions of narrative fictional film would oblige us to separate the filmmaker Debord from both the voice of the film’s commentary and from the “character” played by Debord, a man in his late twenties pursuing a young girl who appears to be no more than seventeen.
