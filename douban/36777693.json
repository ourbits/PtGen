    "introduction": "After previous films devoted to Udo Kier, Nicolas Cage, and Lance Henriksen, we watch British character actor Christopher Lee – who actually did die in 2015 – experience multiple, recurring, generally violent TV and cinema deaths. In just seven minutes, cleverly condensed by montage, nearly seventy brilliant career years pass, full of format changes and unforgettable roles from Dracula to Saruman.",
