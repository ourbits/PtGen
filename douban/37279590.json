    "introduction": "Sweet Störy follows Ray on her five-year-long quest to save Café Truten. “In this journey, she rediscovers lost joy, community, and the powerful alchemy of sourdough,” according to a synopsis which notes that the local institution “serves as a lifeline for the people who live in this far-flung part of the Baltic Sea. The daily ritual of sharing coffee and cake with friends, known as ‘Fika’, underpins the very fabric of social life in Sweden. Compelled by a sense of destiny and the ramshackle charm of the café, Meg leaves her award-winning patisseries in the Bay Area to help transform Café Truten in time for its opening on Midsummer Day.",
