    "introduction": "Asagi, a student at a suburban girls school, tragically loses her friend Satake in an unforeseen accident. However, the other friends of the same group continue their daily life as if nothing happened. Asagi, feeling uneasy and trying to hide her true feelings, begins to experience paranormal phenomena in her surroundings.According to a man, suppressed and lost negative emotions create a \"flow\" that attracts misfortune and negativity. The only way to resist it is \"emptiness.\"Asagi's mental state deteriorates due to her distrust of her friends and qualms about Satake's death. The influence of the intensifying \"flow\" creates an eerie atmosphere at school, affecting unrelated students as well.Amidst this chaos, Asagi comes to understand \"emptiness\" through a casual conversation with Ozeki, who had unknowingly joined their group after Satake's death.",
