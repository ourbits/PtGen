    "introduction": "A man, Vince, wakes up in the middle of a film shoot. He doesn't know what's going on or why he's there, but crew members tell him he's one of the actors in the film so he decides to just play along. During the shooting of one scene, one of the other actors, 122, accidentally kills most of the crew. Vince, 122 and the remaining crew decide to finish the film by themselves, even though there's no script, no sound equipment (they decide to make it a silent film) and no camera (they then decide to also make it a \"blind\" film).Like his music, this first feature film of Quentin Dupieux (aka Mr. Oizo) is at the same time totally retarded and utterly brilliant. A calm yet demented piece of metafiction, examining the boundaries between film and reality in a dry, absurdly humorous way.",
