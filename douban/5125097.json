    "introduction": "Mrs. Geesche is from a crude northern German environment in the early 19th century. As a woman she has no rights - and her urge for freedom leads her to killing 15 people, among them her mother, her father, her children, two husbands and other persons from her immediate environs. She does not want to be one of the men's \"pets\" and \"death is a blessing for someone,\" she says after murdering her own mother. TV adaptation of Fassbinder's 16th play from 1971.",
