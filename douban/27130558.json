The scorching heat is almost as oppressive as the lies they tell. Brick and Maggie dance round the secrets and sexual tensions that threaten to destroy their marriage. With the future of the family at stake, which version of the truth is real – and which will win out?Captured live on stage, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof will screen in cinemas around the world from 22 February 2018.Show image photography Charlie Grey; Production photography Johan Persson",
