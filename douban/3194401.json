    "introduction": "Black and White film, Nominated Best Cinematography.本片的摄影师是Esteban Sapir，后来导演了那部超现实幻想片《天线》What these new Argentinean filmmakers do regarding their influences is a (syncretic?) operation, closer to the appropriation of shots, tones, moments, framings, and isolated characters, instead of trying to transfer complete aesthetic systems. Nor do they propose a (phagocytosis?) to cover the lack of ideas by plagiarizing original models. The case of Fine Powder is utterly clear. The film tells the story of two youngsters and their particular perceptions of the world around them. The director weaves in such a way the stylistic features of the avant-gardes of last century that they are at the same time visible but impossible to identify in each shot. Such is also the case of Fernán Rudnik's El nadador inmóvil (2000).The stings design (cello quartets) is presented as a counterpoint of the sound design of the score, because this (each sound object) is located as a character in the film that goes beyond representation and illustration of each image, of the sounds that takes us to it.",
