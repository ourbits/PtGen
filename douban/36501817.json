    "introduction": "All At Sea is a semi-autobiographical documentary by acclaimed director and scriptwriter Mike Hodges, showing the world through his eyes throughout his life, and how it has changed and stayed the same. Directed, written and narrated by Hodges, it explores Mike’s story from his start in the Navy in the 1950s, to his work for Granada in the 1960s, through to his meteoric success with hits such as Get Carter and Flash Gordon in the 1970s onwards. Reflecting from his quiet Dorset home, Mike Hodges creates a visual ode to the bustle of the sea, the spark of 1960s London, and the darker side of the world that he’s seen through a lens.源自：https://www.locarnofestival.ch/en/festival/program/film/all-at-sea?fid=c607f577-b822-4de9-ad08-09a2297248da&l=en",
