    "introduction": "The first story, The Husband, directed by John B. Murray, was written by Craig McGregor and deals with the jealously of a man over Harry, who seems to be quite friendly with his wife. Full of daydreams, he is comforted by his wife (Elke Neidhardt) who assures him that his suspicions are unfounded. But are they?The second story, The Child, comes from Hal Porter and is set during the 1910s. It has a lot in common with L. P. Hartley's The Go-Between. A child whose father has left watches as first his mother and then his governess have affairs with a local man, with tragic consequences. This episode features Jill Forster and Judy Morris and was directed by Tim Burstall.Story three is The Priest, written by Thomas Keneally. It deals with a priest (Arthur Dignam) who lusts after a nun (Robyn Nevin), and through his mouth we hear what I assume is meant to be a scathing indictment of the dogmatic attitude of the Catholic Church towards sex and the celibacy of the priesthood. This episode was directed by Fred Schepisi.The final and longest story, The Family Man, is by David Williamson. Ken (Jack Thompson) is a property developer whose wife has had a baby the previous night. To celebrate, he calls up a friend Gerry (Max Gillies) and persuades him to come over, with the intention of hiring a couple of prostitutes. When Gerry seems reluctant, Ken instead persuades him to go with him down to the local bar to pick up a couple of sheilas. Which they do, but Ken's self loathing gets in the way of things. David Baker directed.",
