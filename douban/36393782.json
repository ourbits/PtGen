    "introduction": "Eight men and women of different ages and backgrounds embark on an emotionally-fraught journey. All of them were sexually abused as children. Now, as adults, they have agreed to come forth and open up with incredible honesty to give voice to others like them and shed light on a darkness that, according to the Israeli lobby against sexual violence, one in five girls and boys in Israel has faced. The film’s subjects represent the full range of sexual abuse cases. Nitza, Effie, Adiel, Vicky, Yael, Hadar, Bar, and Ahikam share their stories, from the abuse itself to their daily struggle with CPTSD and their empowering choice to forge a path toward healing.源自：https://www.docaviv.co.il/2023-en/films/angels/",
