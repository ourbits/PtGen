    "introduction": "Thirty years after the Balkan wars and the siege of Sarajevo - one of the longest ones in contemporary history - three generations tell each other their own stories. We meet Boba, a war fixer; Zoran, who was only thirteen at the time; Belmina, who was not even born. It is a confrontation in memory and trauma, to try to overcome it. The Holiday Inn hotel in Sarajevo, the \"home\" of many foreign correspondents and TV crews, listens to and gathers these stories. HOTEL SARAJEVO and its protagonists, retraces some of the events of the conflict in former Yugoslavia to recount the wounds of a war that took place in the heart of Europe.源自：https://tickets.sff.ba/films/1909",
