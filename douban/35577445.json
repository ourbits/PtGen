    "introduction": "In 1968, Asllan Gjinovci is a physics student at the University of Prishtina. Following his involvement in student protests asking for the autonomy of Kosovo in Yugoslavia, he's forced to flee the country. Setting him out on a three-year odyssey, hiding a few months in Croatia then spending two and a half years in refugee camps in Italy, to finally settle in Switzerland. His journey away from home inexorably keeps him away from his family and homeland for more than thirty years. As his daughter, Kosovo is an unknown part of my identity, mainly shaped by 90's news footage of the Kosovo war. So I decide to take my father on a trip to retrace his exile from the last refugee camp in Italy where he stayed to his birthplace in Kosovo. Seeking to explore the impact of this exile on his life and at the same time on mine.",
