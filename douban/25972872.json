A sequel to Becky & Joe's original mind-bending viral hit \"Don't Hug Me I'm Scared\", which has amassed over 13 million views on YouTube to date and inspired a wave of related videos, Don't Hug Me I'm Scared II\" is an unsettling lesson in the dangers of time and the perils of metaphysical introspection.",
