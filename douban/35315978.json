The only clue left behind points Veronica toward Daring Adventures, an abandoned amusement park used by her father to test his fantastical steam-powered inventions. There she discovers a strange girl named Jules, a fellow inventor, who agrees to help Veronica in locating her missing father, and discovering the secrets of his work. Determined to save her father, Veronica assumes the secret identity of \"Hullabaloo\", a goggled crusader who uses wits and science to combat evil and oppose the nefarious conspiracy that has taken her father.",
