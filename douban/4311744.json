    "introduction": "The Jaquie Brown Diaries is a new satirical comedy to 3, in which Jaquie Brown plays an insecure, status obsessed, light relief reporter on a hard hitting current affairs show.Each week Jaquie tries different ways to raise her public profile in the media both through her own methods and those of her morally bankrupt publicist Kim Sharee. She also has to deal with a new reporter on the show, the beautiful, funny and multi-talented Serita Singh (Madeleine Sami) whose journalistic style is strikingly similar to Jaquie's and who seems to be stealing her thunder at an alarming rate.The series takes a satirical look at the life of a C-grade celebrity and brings the society supplements of the newspapers to frightening fruition as Jaquie converses, romances and bitch-slaps many of New Zealand's most well known celebrities.Helen Clark, Anika Moa, Jackie Clarke and Antony Starr are just a few of the familiar faces who will pop up at some point over the 6 part half hour series.",
