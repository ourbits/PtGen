    "introduction": "Should we trust AI & robots to operate heavy machinery, work in space, conduct job interviews and supervise humans? As the construction industry faces labour shortages, Enlai tests himself against robots built for the construction industry in Singapore. Co-host Elizabeth Lazan visits an American robotics start-up that makes construction vehicles autonomous. Enlai's robot buddy Delbo visits Germany to meet the makers of CIMON, an AI-enabled robot designed to accompany & assist astronauts in space. Co-host Sebomi explores a growing trend in South Korea where AI is used to conduct job interviews. Meanwhile, Enlai projects his likeness on a robot in Sweden, where some claim robot interviewers can be fairer than human ones. AI is being used to supervise workers. One solution monitors employees and rates them upon 100. But how does that impact employee morale and is that ethical?S3E1: Part 1: Will AI Be A Good Boss And Co-Worker?
