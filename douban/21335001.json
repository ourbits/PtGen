    "introduction": "Reflections have two sides. One side records the truth, the other the ideal. Both exist in rejecting each other. Expression is itself created by this denial. Time moves forward inexorably towards immortality, whilst at the same time fighting it. Within this movement, ‘uneri’ – the wave - is born and the sun rises.Uzushio -Seto Current- is the second part of a body of work that takes a contemporary approach to examining the material of film itself. In this part, Naoto expands his analysis of the film material to include a narrative.",
