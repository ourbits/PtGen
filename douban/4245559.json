    "introduction": "Hyenas's Sun is the first feature of a promising young Tunisian director, Ridha Behi, who is being hailed as one of the hopes of the emerging African cinema. His film is an uncomfortable one for Europeans as its subject is the way in which sunseeking holiday tourists cause the alteration and destruction of life in Mediterranean villages by their ever expanding demand for tourist centres by the sea.\"The film tells the \"fictional\" story of how one such North African fishing village ends up becoming a tourist resort with the backing of a German company. Construction work brings about a cessation of the traditional occupation of fishing and before long the traditional market also disappears and small commercial shops orientated towards tourists begin to appear.\" (Ken Wlaschin, Films and Filming)",
