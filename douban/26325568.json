    "introduction": "Poet and director Jem Goulding captures the inner truths of the restless Prince of dance, in an avant-garde documentary shot entirely on film by filmmaker herself. It is an intimate portrait of young Sergei Polunin, one of the most elusive yet revered figures in the history of Russian ballet. Polunin speaks openly and honestly with Goulding, stripping away some of the sensational fantasies the international press has created about his person.",
