    "introduction": "After World War II, for almost half a century the communist one-party system did everything in its power to persecute the Christian Churches in Hungary. Hundreds of innocent priests and monks were imprisoned, while the State Security authority recruited others into its network as agents.The documentary presents this historical era, the informer network operating within the church and the power of faith and fidelity opposed to this, which gave strength to many in their suffering as they experienced dramatic personal destinies.The film evokes the past via the poignant and cathartic lives of people who became the victims or servants of a dictatorial system",
