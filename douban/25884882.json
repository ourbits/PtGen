    "introduction": "Lonely Jonah walks his dog Floppy in the park, where he is surprised to see a crowd of people fascinated by a charismatic American, who throws his own dog in the air and catches it. Not to be outdone Jonah joins in with Floppy. However a journalist puts the American on the front of the local paper, calling him an abuser of animals and he is interviewed on television, where he blames Jonah for his actions. Both become pariahs but, encouraged by the sweet Jessica, decide to get back to dog throwing - though Floppy lets Jonah know of his disapproval by nipping him on the nose.",
