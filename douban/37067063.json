    "introduction": "A disturbing dystopian essay stylistically inspired by Chris Marker's La Jetée. By recycling photographs from personal albums, advertising shots and scientific images manipulated to varying degrees by artificial intelligence tools, it tells the story of a woman in a sunless future, on an arid Earth turned into a desert, and critically and ironically examines humanity's relationship with technology.",
