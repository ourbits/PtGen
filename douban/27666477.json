Johnny is busy running the motel with Stevie as his partner. Business is booming, but it’s a challenge for him to balance work and family, while dealing with Roland’s antics. Moira is carrying out her duties with Town Council and the Jazzagals, and is also looking for new ways to utilize her talents, whether it’s through a theatrical performance, or by helping Alexis navigate event planning. David is managing his store and attempting to maintain a brand new relationship, but between struggling to find the time for romance, and overcoming the anxieties of his dating past, this is proving to be a challenge. Meanwhile, Alexis is putting all of her energy into school and her career, but is finding it difficult to focus when she still has lingering feelings for her ex-fiancé, Ted.",
