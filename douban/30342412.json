    "introduction": "He made perhaps the most dramatic shot in the history of NCAA basketball tournament. He's the only player to start in four consecutive Final Fours, and was instrumental in Duke winning two national championships. He had looks, smarts and games. So why has Christian Laettner been disliked so intensely by so many for so long? Maybe it was the he stomped on the chest of a downed player, or the battles he had with his teammates, or a perceived sense of entitlement. But sometimes, perception isn't reality. Directed by Rory Karpf (\"The Book of Manning\", \"Time Richmond: To The Limit\"), I Hate Christian Laettner will go beyond the polarizing persona to reveal the complete story behind this lightning rod of college basketball. Featuring extensive access to Laettner, previously unseen footage and perspectives from all sides, this film will be a \"gloves-off\" examination of the man who has been seen by many as the \"Blue Devil Himself\".",
