    "introduction": "Vienna might be reflected in people with megalomania and pessism in this film. Erwin, a young man, who came to Vienna with a great ambition to be successful as an actor, has been unsuccessful so far. Even his relationship with a waitress Karin disappoints him. She runs her life by working in a miserable suburban cafe. Wolf is a poet who can't create any poet and whose life just goes hard. And Claudia from Germany, tired in this decadent city. What is seen in this film, love or helplessness, or both of them.",
