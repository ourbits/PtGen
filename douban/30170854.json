    "introduction": "In Sweden two investigators are working on identifying images of a child being raped by two men. In northern Romania a girl is being offered a job in Italy, but ends up as a sex slave. A Russian man is investing money in Cambodia. Parallel to his business venture he rapes one child after the other. Three girls move to the capital of South Sudan to look for a job. But the demand for sex has created an extensive market involving perpetrators such as ex-soldiers, aid workers and businessmen. While No One Is Watching takes us through the stories of the children, the police officers and the organizations fighting to stop commercial sexual exploitation of children.",
