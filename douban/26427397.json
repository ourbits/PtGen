    "introduction": "«Arventur» is a dilogy about an imaginary land that is magically visited by the films’ characters. The first part is based on Alexander Grin’s story «Fandango» and takes place in Saint-Petersburg in 1921. The second part, called «The Mystery of the Sea View» is based on a Daoist parable about a great Chinese artist and the Emperor. The Emperor, who has grown up on paintings by an artist, comes to realize that the real world of his kingdom is not as beautiful and harmonious as the reality in the artist’s paintings. The Emperor can’t accept all the filth and horror of the cruel reality. The skill and enchantment of the artist have made all that he possesses revolting, and made him wish for what he can never have.",
