    "introduction": "Director Keleman tells the story of a couple that's on the verge of breaking up. A man is unemployed, bored with life, impassive, and doesn't want to admit to his girlfriend he loves her. They separate for one night. The film follows their nocturnal encounters with other people on the fringes of society. Abendland tries to depict a couple that suffers from a fin de siecle crisis in a world that looks even more gruesome than the former Eastern bloc ever did.Shot in a Andrei Tarkovsky manner, this film is as repellent as their main characters. It bores its audience with hand-held video close-ups and songs from a washed-up female nightclub singer.",
