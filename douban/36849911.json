Top 25 Alien Encounters explores some of the most mind-blowing cases of recent times, exposing new details behind hidden secrets, suppressed evidence and cover-ups. Stunning Military encounters, Astronaut accounts, abductions, crashed UFO retrievals, Alien body examinations, startling witness confessions, NASA's subversive agenda and much more reveal a foreboding reality -- that they no longer hide in the shadows, but are looming over us in plain sight.",
