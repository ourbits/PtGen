Determined to stay independent, Renee refuses any public assistance, but her desperation leads to a difficult decision: leaving her daughter, in the car during a job interview, which results in her arrest and Imani being taken by Child Protective Services.  As Renee navigates family court, she discovers the support of those around her and comes to understand that she can’t do it all on her own. With the help of new friends, she starts to see a glimmer of hope in her situation and remains steadfast in her determination to do whatever it takes to be reunited with her daughter.",
