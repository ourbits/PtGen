    "introduction": "In a farming village one year, people couldn't find a grain of rice because of severe drought. Chun-bo is the one who always thought that they needed a reservoir in order to prepare for the drought. But no one agreed with his idea. Without any alternatives, he and several like-minded men begin construction of reservoir. Accordingly, a fight ensues between them and their opponents. But Chun-bo is not wavered and stays firm. In the end, the villagers begin to sympathize with his strong will. In no time, rice plants wave on the autumn field.",
