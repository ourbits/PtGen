    "introduction": "A Place Called Music is a documentary about the peculiar musical encounter between Daniel Medina, a traditional Wixarika violinist from the mountains of Jalisco, Mexico, and Philip Glass, the eminent composer from New York City.The documentary features live music as rehearsals and performances take place in prominent venues in Mexico and New York – music that has only been heard in ceremonial Wixárika gatherings but this time has an unprecedented addition: a grand piano.Even though Daniel and Philip come from very different backgrounds and don't even speak the same language, they have created a common place where their spirits can meet and unravel each other – their music.",
