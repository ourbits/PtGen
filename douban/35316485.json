    "introduction": "First Aid manuals inspire the work by Brazilian artist Alexandre da Cunha. The performance deals with the fragility of the body. A collaborator is invited to repeat a sequence of movements that hark back to treatment and intervention procedures, such as massages, bandaging and autopsy. The artist is considered a follower of the relational art proposed by Brazilian artist Lygia Clark.",
