    "introduction": "She was a very modern young woman, was Miss Hobbs. Her ideas were about fifty years ahead of time. For one thing she hated men, thought them all brutes. But love has a way of smashing such an idea. Then she went in for barefoot dancing, futurist art and other advanced notions. Well, the upshot of it was the young man took upon himself to tame her, to make her a regular girl. How he succeeded is told in five reels of enlivened action.
