    "introduction": "On Saturday, October 27th, 2018, a white supremacist, further radicalized by the political climate at the time, walked into the Tree of Life Synagogue with four semi automatic assault weapons, shouting \"all Jews must die.\" He murdered eleven congregants, ranging in age from 54 to 97, as they prayed. A TREE OF LIFE creates a deeply personal portrait of the survivors, victims, and the victims' family members of the Pittsburgh Synagogue attack, and brings into sharp focus the hate-based crisis that threatens our collective safety and democracy itself.",
