    "introduction": "The resounding directorial debut of Claire Devers, awarded the Golden Camera at the Cannes Film Festival, serves as an adaptation of one of Tennessee Williams' early novellas, Desire and the Black Masseur, in which the American playwright tells a tale of desire that unexpectedly connects two men living in New Orleans, an unassuming clerk and the titular black masseur. Devers transports this story from the American South of the 1940s to France in the 1980s. The film's protagonist, Antoine, is a timid accountant leading a peaceful life with his partner, Edith. One day, due to professional obligations, he finds himself at a sports club where he meets Dominique, a black masseur whose touch becomes addicting. The boundaries between pleasure and suffering gradually blur as massages from the muscular man become increasingly brutal and painful, and Antoine willingly succumbs to the sadomasochistic game of which he becomes a co-author and victim.源自：https://www.nowehoryzonty.pl/vod-film.s?id=12987",
