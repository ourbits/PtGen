He offers her a deal: if she can match a new couple before Valentine's Day, she will find her true love. If not, she will lose, and her true love will be lost forever. She tries to match this girl to that boy, this boy to that girl. Until on Valentine's Day, she just knows that she has her own guy whom she's always had her eyes on, but she's just never realized that before.—Eve P'Berm",
