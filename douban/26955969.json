    "introduction": "The town of Tomioka was evacuated after the meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2011. Naoto MATSUMURA was the only one who refused to leave, and by now, other former inhabitants revisit their houses regularly, preparing to move back to their hometown as soon as possible. Their hopes may seem irrational, but Gilles Laurent's impressive documentary focuses on their steadfast will to survive.",
