    "introduction": "A fabulous documentary with the all star Latin Jazz pianists and musicians doing the narration. Ernesto Lecuona was enviably the finest Latin pianist coming out of Cuba. He traveled the world playing and the movie is like a tour guide of Cuba, Seville Spain, the Canary islands, Manhattan and more. Chucho Valdez, Gonzalo Rualcaba and Michel Camilo take you on a tour of the Steinways, the man that influenced their lives and the music that captivated the whole world. This documentary is a must see and the people that play Lecuona's music are endearing, accessible and a testament to the man and his music. Raimundo Amador is the fine guitarist that has a great guitar style and adds the Flamenco flavor to a tune played with Gonzalo Rubalcaba. The finest example of Latin piano, jazz and other music styles that Lecuona borrowed and developed from classical to jazz, rolled up in a fine Doc that should win an Oscar. Music is the universal language.",
