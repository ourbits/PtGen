    "introduction": "At 35, JR is one of the most famous French artists in the world and yet among the most disliked by the art world. Discovered after the riots in the Parisian suburbs in 2005 for his portraits of young people from the slums, he has since taken over the Louvre, the Pompidou Center, the Pantheon and the National Assembly with his collages. At the same time photographer, poster artist, filmmaker and choreographer, JR installs giant performances in public places and often creates controversy, due to the eminently political scope of his work. From Kenya to Istanbul, from Paris to Ellis Island, passing through Cuba, Rio, Tunis, the wall between Israel and Palestine, the American-Mexican border, this film shows us an artist who participates in the defense of numerous causes (educational, solidarity, humanitarian) and associates hundreds of thousands of unknown people to his artistic projects.",
