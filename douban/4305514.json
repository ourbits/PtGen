    "introduction": "Her sister having recently taken flight from their turbulent family home in order to attend college in Paris, a thirteen year-old Mexico City teen becomes obsessed with all things breast-related in director Marisa Sistach's playful coming of age story. The year is 1962: The Feminine Mystique has yet to be published, alluring images of Marilyn Monroe and Brigitte Bardot whip teenage boys into a hormonal frenzy, the space race is in full swing, and everyone who's anyone is out on the dance floor doing \"The Twist\". Emma's sister Cecilia has left for college in Paris, leaving the insecure adolescent to deal with their parent's incessant bickering all alone. As young Emma begins to experience the odd effects of puberty, she begins to develop a curious case of breast fever. Everything about breasts fascinates her, from nursing infants to that curious mammary support system known as the brassiere. Later, after Emma's mother experiences a frightening breast cancer scare, the boldly empowered adolescent sets out to single handedly launch the women's movement in her home country.",
