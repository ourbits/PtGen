    "introduction": "Everything is complicated in Yoni's life. He's almost 13, really smart, but physically underdeveloped and struggles daily to quickly grow into the physique of a man for his up-coming Bar Mitzvah. His classmates bully him every chance they get and his parents barely say a word to each other or, if at all, communicate through him. As if all this weren't enough his autistic brother, Tomer, 17, locked away for years in an institution, returns home right before the ceremony. This shakes up the unstable foundation of the entire family. Being the only real adult in his family, Yoni ends up dealing on his own with a brother he hasn't seen in ten years and who becomes obsessed with Yoni's Torah-excerpt about Noah. It is a pretty rough growing up and growing together for the entire family as painful truths, mistakes of the past and sorrows of the present are confronted.Awards and Nominations: Nominated for Best Actor, Actress, Best Picture, and Best Sound at 2010 Israeli Film Academy Awards. Won Best Supporting Actor at 2010 Israeli Film Academy Awards. Won Crystal Bear-Special Mention at 2011 Berlin International Film Festival.",
