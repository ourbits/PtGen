    "introduction": "Midway, Utah is in contention with two other cities to be featured on Sterling Masters' Holiday Adventures. Heading up Midway's push to get the attention which would give a much needed boost to the local resort and recreation business industry is Aria (Kellie Pickler) whose family owns The Mistletoe Diner. As it turns out Sterling Masters is only the face of the show while his best friend Alex is the writer and heart of the show. . Alex comes to the Mistletoe Diner in advance to gather intel. He butts heads with Aria who is none too subtle about her idolization of Masters and is rubbed the wrong way by Alex's sarcastic remarks questioning Masters' dubious talents. Loosely based on N.Y. Times best-selling author Richard Paul Evans' novel of the same name.",
