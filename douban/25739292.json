    "introduction": "Produced from source material gathered in Iceland in 1976, Flux uses the flow of water and video noise as the basis for a study of multi-directional movement within switched frames or slow-scanned noise fields. Steina works with recorded images and video tools — a field flip/flop switcher and a scan processor — to arrive at a synthesis of nature and electronics.",
