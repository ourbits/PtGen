    "introduction": "Five young tourists(Mike,Darren,Emily,Linda and Sarah)are on vacation in an Asian city.First they visit a traditional Night Market,where they are shocked to see a butcher slaughtering a dog for meat.After this gruesome event they decide to relax and have some fun in a local Karaoke Bar,where Emily meets a handsome Japanese man named Miles.Unfortunately for them Mike insults the Triad Boss,who entered the place with his henchmen.Big mistake!However Miles defuses the situation as he apologizes to the Boss and persuades the tourists to move on as soon as possible.Soon the action moves into a creepy porno theatre.The tourists buy tickets and enter this filthy place to forget about the evening's hostilities.Unbeknownst to them the Boss and his cohort have followed them to the Venus Theatre.The sadistically explicit bloodbath begins there...First of all I enjoyed Ryan Nicholson's nasty rape and revenge shocker \"Torched\",but \"Live Feed\" is even better.It is also one of the goriest horror films I have seen.The gore is plentiful and truly extreme with dismemberments,decapitations,grisly tortures,sword impalings and geysers of grue to boost.The acting is great and the action is fast-paced,intense and bloody as hell.Stephen Chang is especially memorable as the Triad Boss with a taste for human flesh.So if you are a fan of gore or grindhouse exploitation flicks you can't go wrong with \"Live Feed\".10 out of 10.Truly awesome stuff that will surely please genre fans!",
