As they hop the bucolic islands, the aging poet recalls his youthful tragic love, comes to terms with his artistic (im)potence and struggles with the uneasy relationship between the noblemen and the commons. Filmed on location in Adriatic, the film is an intricate patchwork of reality, memories, dreams and visions.",
