    "introduction": "The contemporary Georgian filmmakers’ favorite film revolves around Sosana, a shepherd who lives with his wife, his son and a friend. In the quiet country life, among flocks of sheep and family warmth, serenity is the rule. The old man knows of no other lifestyle, and modifying is not within his future plans. But everything changes when a group of geologists discovers oil and the shepherd’s land, and the machines settle in the immense and virgin valleys. Sosana’s true confrontation will be against modernity, which demands he adapt to the inevitable changes. In Great Green Valley, the most recurring subjects of Soviet cinema -the connection between man and land and the people’s relationship with work- crash into Kokochashvili’s surprising inclusion—the pessimism and skepticism before collective solutions.源自：https://www.mardelplatafilmfest.com/38/en/pelicula/great-green-valley",
