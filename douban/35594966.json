    "introduction": "The film about Sergei Bondarchuk is neither a traditional portrait of the director's career nor a biopic celebrating his anniversary. Authors of the \"Battle\" focus on the unique period in cinema history — a post-war era of great expectations in which the \"War and Peace\" movie creator became the key figure. Who was this man and filmmaker that succeeded in making both personal dramas and megalomaniac battle pieces? And how did he, being the prize-winner of USSR's numerous awards, manage to become a person of global interest and the binding link between East and West in the time of the Cold War?",
