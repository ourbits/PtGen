    "introduction": "Go easy on this movie.......hell, it's the only time that Lee VanCleef gets to have a wife who actually likes him (at least for a little while). And it's Beverly Garland!!!.... at her sexiest, with her pointed padded Maidenform bra. What a babe! This is such a fun movie and a good one of its type......the black and white, 50's, paranoiac, cheesy monster \"B\" flick. There were so many of this type film being made during the 1950's and there are some that are a lot worse than this one. Sure, the monster is a hoot but it worked for the audiences at the time. The stories were always the same......an outerspace entity (a carrot,cucumber, crawling eye, etc) comes to take over the earth, even though there is only one of them (wouldn't it take a long time to overpower the entire world population?). Additionally, they always use a scientist as their champion who is so obtuse that he doesn't realize what their game plan is and who always get killed in the end. So it's predictable, cheap, and overacted........so what! It's a lot of fun and there is a subculture of us out there who love this movie and all the others of the genre. The next time it shows up on TV, give it a look.....you won't regret it!",
