    "introduction": "A look at the life of the Legendary Irving Fields, and watch him continue to play live concerts at 100 years old.\"Unstoppable Irving Fields\" is the story of Irving Fields, one of the most influential American musicians of all time, and his daring attempt to resurge his career at age 99. When all his peers are retired or dead, Irving can't wait to go to work every day, playing piano for New Yorkers. He's the oldest musician still working in America - maybe the world - and proud of it. He's sold millions of records, co-wrote a hit with Louis Armstrong, and is a world-renowned pianist with an endless stream of great stories to tell. But now he's facing his greatest challenge: he's been laid off. Instead of finally retiring, Irving sets his heart and mind to not only getting a new job, but to resurge his career, to record a new hit song and to start playing big concerts again. He and his young, 82-year-old wife, Ruth, embark on a mission to show the world that Irving and his unique blend of Jewish and Latin music are still as relevant as ever. he seems like he'll live forever.",
