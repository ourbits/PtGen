    "introduction": "Immediately after the Boston Marathon bombing in April 2013, amateur detectives took to internet chat rooms to try and find the culprits. Users on reddit, 4chan, and other gathering spots poured over photographs uploaded to the sites, looking for any detail that might point to the guilt of potential suspects. Using texts and jpegs culled from these investigations, Watching the Detectives narrates the process of crowd sourcing culpability.",
