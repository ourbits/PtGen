Adam seems to be suffering from a mysterious disease that causes him to lose the pigmentation of his hair all over his body and makes him blind. His transformation is disrupted one day by a young woman named Eva, who accidentally rings his parlophone. As they begin to form an unlikely friendship, Eva tries to lure Adam out into the real world to join her.
