    "introduction": "Round Sky Square Earth is the expression used in ancient China to describe the world, inspiring Chinese artists to paint nature. Using film grammar Yu Depeng “transforms” the screening roominto the atmosphere of Chinese landscape painting or shanshui (“mountain and water”). This artistic and visual statement draws attention to the climate emergency and the unviable Eurocentric practice of our environment, highlighting the uniqueness of traditional Chinese thought as an alternative to social and environmental sustainability.",
