Each episode answers questions from real kids like \"Why does the moon follow you?”, \"Do plants think?”, \"Why do we have to eat?\" and \"Why can’t everything be solar-powered?\". Harrison is the host and he digs up the answers by doing experiments, getting the coolest guests and researching the most incredible facts ever. On Finding Stuff out you'll see the most amazing things, find stuff out that you always wondered about and laugh your head off too.",
