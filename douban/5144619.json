    "introduction": "Santabear is given a mission by Santa himself to deliver presents to the South Pole, where hardly anyone believes in Santa Clause, or Christmas. He's also warned of Bullybear, his evil counterpart, who steals his sack of gifts and attempts to ruin Christmas in a worse way than just taking them for himself. Bullybear plans to deliver the toys used and broken, to destroy everyone's faith in Santa all over the world, starting by framing Santabear in the South Pole. Aided by Missy, Santabear recovers his good name, the toys, and exposes Bullybear. \"Sooner or later, everyone shows their true colors\". Very touching, without being sappy or religious. The lullaby Santabear sings is very sweet, but if you really listen to the lyrics, they read like bad poetry. It kinda makes sense, though, since he says he's \"making it up as he goes\".",
