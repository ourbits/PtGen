    "introduction": "ORION: THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING tells the story of Jimmy Ellis, an unknown singer thrust into the spotlight as part of a scheme that had him masquerading as Elvis back from the grave. With a fictional identity torn from the pages of Gail Brewer Giorgio’s novel Orion, the backing of the legendary birthplace of rock ‘n’ roll, Sun Records, and a voice eerily similar to Presley’s, the “Elvis is alive” myth began. The story of Orion proves that fact is, indeed, ‘stranger than fiction.’ This is the story behind that story.",
