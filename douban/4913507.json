    "introduction": "about teenagers in Vilnius who are still immensely influenced by Woodstock and decide to hold their own rock love-in on a campsite near a lake. The next morning they are brutally attacked by police who return them to their parents. One of the young couples at this event is separated later when the girl’s family emigrates to Israel. The title of the film belongs to an unofficial club to which these teenagers belong and indicates their fascination with all things American – which is seen as a rebellion against all things Russian.",
