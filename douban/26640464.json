When the Storybook of Legends is found by Alistair Wonderland and Bunny Blanc, the two friends decide to bring the book back to Ever After High, but the Cheshire Cat has other plans for the book and swaps it with a book of cursed riddles instead, that turn all who read it topsy-turvy with their wild magic, one of whom is Apple, who thus threatens to destroy the fairytale world. Now, with only Maddie, Alistair, Lizzie, Bunny and Kitty left, they must solve the malicious riddle of the Cheshire Cat, and save their friends.",
