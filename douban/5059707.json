    "introduction": "The title leads the viewer to believe they are about to watch a classic comedy. However, this film is no comedy, rather a drama with some thriller aspects. Set shortly after the war, Gordon Jackson, plays an British soldier who served in France during the war. He has returned to civilian life and is about to marry his sweetheart (Christina Gregg). Shortly after the ceremony he is contacted by a woman (Lisa Daniely) he knew in France who he romanced during the war.The story unfolds that Jackson was seriously injured during the fighting in France. During this time, Daniely claims Jackson proposed and they were married. Unfortunately for Jackson, he lost his memory for a short time and he can't disprove her claim.Daniely offers to leave the two newlyweds forever as long as Jackson can pay her a considerable sum of money. Now Jackson (and the viewer) realizes that Daniely is a fraud and they were never married. But how can he prove it and is someone else involved in the blackmail scheme.The film is certainly no cracker, but the current rating (3.4) is a little harsh. Yes, it's a little staid and very low budget. Still it was a pleasant enough 65 minutes if one is not expecting too much.",
