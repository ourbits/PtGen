    "introduction": "Snooki & JWoww is an American reality television series on MTV starring Nicole \"Snooki\" Polizzi and Jennifer \"JWoww\" Farley, the first of two spinoffs of Jersey Shore, on which both Polizzi and Farley previously gained fame as cast members. The first season focuses on Polizzi and Farley living together in a former firehouse in Jersey City, New Jersey, though Polizzi's pregnancy, which was confirmed during filming of the first season, led to a change in episode content and tone that would distance it from the party-oriented antics of its parent show.",
