    "introduction": "When Ethan joins a yearly camping tradition at the request of his best friend; he reconnects with old friends after a year of absence. His reunion is received differently from everyone. The group takes a boat to a deserted island and with enough alcohol they start to act like their old selves. Things seem to be going well until Ethan discovers a wooden box which reveals a black spot stained in on an old piece of vellum. Thinking nothing of it, they burn it, and everything seems perfect in paradise... Until someone dies. Fingers are pointed, past events remembered, and friendships desperately try to stay together as paranoia blinds the group. All the while being chased by a lie they can no longer escape....",
