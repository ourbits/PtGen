Ten years ago, the Aflam Festival, co-produced by the MUCEM (Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilizations) was born and has been held there every year since then, as well as in different places in the city. The audience is set to discover a selection of recent films, rarely shown in movie theatres, or older films that marked the history of cinema in Arab countries, and can discuss with the directors invited to talk about their work. In celebration of its tenth anniversary, Aflam & Aflamuna present a retrospective of ten years of Aflam festival, showing a film featured from each of the editions, each month.",
