    "introduction": "For some strange reason I have now sat through practically all of these 70's cheerleader movies. Only The Swinging Cheerleaders (directed by Jack Hill) is a drive-in classic, but Satan's Cheerleaders comes close. The Cheerleaders (1972)is truly awful but it does deliver on the softcore sleaze. The Revenge of the Cheerleaders features the disturbing images of a very pregnant Rainbeaux Smith and a not-so-pregnant David Hasselhoff cavorting around in the nude. The Pom-Pom Girls is surprisingly innocent and realistic and might have appealed more to actual 70's teenagers than horny middle-aged men. The Cheerleader's Wild Weekend is forgettable (at least, I've forgotten it). Then there's this movie, which is probably the most obscure of the cycle. The plot resembles that of the original The Cheerleaders where our nubile heroines attempt to \"wear out\" the opposing team before the big game, except that it's set on the beach (where's Jaws when you need him?) It might be the worst of 70's cheerleader exploitation flicks, but at least it's better than Bring It On.",
