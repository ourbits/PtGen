    "introduction": "This cinematic artwork addresses the decline and eventual dismissal of the chorus of ancient Greece from epic drama. Figured as a marginalized representative of 'the people' the film proposes a contemporary wandering chorus that engages the populous through \"Star Wars Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith\". Taking aim at the rhythmic efficiency of a corporate Hollywood franchise this cinematic recut tests the possible agency of the collective voice. Through choral banter, song and dance, the character replies to the sophomoric philosophy of the film, asking whether the loss of a plural subject correlates to the decline of traditional democratic ideals in popular forms of narrative storytelling.",
