    "introduction": "西班牙才女演员Silvia Munt最新自编自导自演的作品，她出演的一些影片有Juanma Bajo Ulloa的《蝴蝶的翅膀》，Montxo Armendáriz的《心灵秘密》等。Viena, a stage director, and Daniel, a geriatrician, are experiencing a crisis in their marriage. They love each other, but they often can’t stand each other. Both are dependent on their work, but have no understanding for each other’s professional commitments. Their worlds are different, as are their needs. Or are they? We’re all searching for the same thing. Viena is getting ready for the premiere of a play which examines the dichotomy of duty and desire, and reality and fiction. Her leading actor is also a close partner, both on and off the stage. Daniel’s profession is less stressful and anchored more in reality. His daily routine involves brief conversations with Eva who lives only in the real world, a world of responsibilities, night shifts and dedication towards her sick elderly patients. Committed to ease human suffering, she has no room in her life for her own desires. Only Lucas, Daniel’s son from his first marriage, obsessed with recording sounds and furtive hunter of random conversations, knows her great secret.Silvia Munt (b. 1957, Barcelona) studied classical and modern dance, which she combined with a psychology course. In 1974 she graduated from the Royal Ballet in London and spent the next four years performing ballet exclusively. She began her acting career at the age of 19 and also established her own theatre group. She debuted in film with Orgy (Orgia, 1977) and, since that time, she has appeared in over thirty films. She has won various awards, including Best New Artist for Diamond Square (La plaza del Diamante, 1981) and a Goya for her performance in Butterfly Wings (Alas de mariposa, 1991). She launched her directing career with the short film Lalia (1999, Goya award). For television she made the film Quia (2003), Mohamed’s Daughter (Las hijas de Mohamed, 2003), the feature-length documentary Elena Dimitrievna Diakonova. Gala (2003) and the documentary film Things That Happen (Cosas que pasan, 2005). Pretexts (2007) is her feature film debut.",
