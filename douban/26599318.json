We follow the group as they navigate the greasy world of nugget vending under the watchful gaze of Mary, their eternally optimistic but desperately ineffectual branch manager. Her job is coveted by bitter assistant manager Derek, who's been working at the restaurant \"since it were a Wimpy\". Then there's geeky teenager Joe, who only has eyes for Amara; and the man who's decided they're best friends - foul-mouthed and relentlessly self-absorbed Ed; and the older, always riled Shontal. Every week the team have to deal with the customers, each other and the indelible smell of oil.",
