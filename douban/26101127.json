Of all the species on Earth, we alone ask questions. This series tackles the greatest questions we've ever asked. Where are we in the universe? Why are we here? How did the human brain arise and why did we become consciousness? Will our search for alien life be successful or are we all alone? And what is our future?In search of answers, Brian sets off across the globe collecting clues from the people that he encounters and linking them to the latest scientific thinking on each question. Combining beautiful location photography, imaginative CGI and his own magical storytelling Brian presents a new understanding of the ultimate wonder of the universe - us.",
