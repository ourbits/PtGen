    "introduction": "A modern day 'Romeo and Juliet' tale unfolds at the ice rinks and pool parties of Ulaan Baatar as teenagers Misheel and Khulgee, a UFC fighter and a violinist, fall head over heels for each other in what can only be love at first sight. However, as Khulgee's boxing club faces an economic crisis, he is drawn into criminal activity which puts his and Misheel's relationship into a tailspin. A gorgeous-looking, refreshingly energetic portrayal of teen romance and all the emotional highs and lows that come with it, 'I Love You, My 18' is a very Mongolian look at adolescent desire, making it one of very few films from the country exploring the subject.",
