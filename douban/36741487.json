    "introduction": "The AINU tribe is like a severed head, yet, it has spoken thanks to the creationof a dictionary of their speech. The dictionary was created at the end of the 19thcentury and the beginning of the 20th century by BRONISŁAW PIŁSUDSKI, whohad been sent to Sakhalin due to conviction for an attempt on the tzar AlexanderIII. The AINU tribe does not exist anymore, but its language has been salvageddue to recordings of its sound on audio rolls made by BRONISŁAW PIŁSUDSKI in1905. The history of this language recordings on the audio rolls of Thomas AlvaEdison’s phonograph and the history of playing those recordings after almost onehundred years is the idea of our movie Message.",
