    "introduction": "Old Trafford. 12th Sept 1970. Manchester United vs Coventry. Not an important match in itself, but a record was preserved of it that is probably unique in the history of film and television. Using eight 16mm cameras, Hellmuth Costard, one of the most important experimental filmmakers in German cinema of the 60s and 70s, followed every move over the 90 minutes of the man in the red no. 11 shirt – George Best. What at first seems like an eccentric experiment turns in the course of the film into something much more valuable: a clear view of the great man's progress through an entire match, his attempts to \"read the game\" and an insight into how carefully a player like Best paces himself during the course of an entire game.",
