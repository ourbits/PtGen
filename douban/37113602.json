    "introduction": "泰勒·普伦德加斯特（由杰里米·沙达饰演）是伯伦格高中史上最有野心的学生会主席。在他那颇具权谋的幕僚长哈德利（由阿登·罗斯饰演）的帮助下，普伦德加斯特像国会山上的老练政客一样管理着学校，千方百计地维持自己的权力。从举办学校史上最盛大的集会，到寻找自己的“第一夫人”，再到打击对手（甚至是无辜的新生），普伦德加斯特无所不用其极，每当他与新任校长（由克里斯蒂娜·摩尔饰演）发生冲突时，便会掀起一场政治风暴。如果她认为可以阻挡他的步伐，她很快就会明白学校的课程才刚刚开始。Tyler Prendergast (Jeremy Shada) is the most ambitious student body president in the history of Berenger High. With his Machiavellian chief of staff, Hadley (Arden Rose), Prendergast runs the school like a slick politician on Capitol Hill, as he maintains power by any means necessary. With ambitions ranging from throwing the greatest pep rally in school history, to finding his own \"first lady,\" to crushing his opponents (even innocent Freshman), Prendergast sets off political fireworks whenever he clashes with the new school principal (Christina Moore). If she thinks she can stand in his way, she'll soon learn soon enough. School is now in session.",
