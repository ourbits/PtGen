    "introduction": "Sake, often called “Japanese rice wine,” is an alcoholic beverage brewed from fermented rice and has a wide range of variety. Gaining global popularity over the recent years, sake has a long, deep history in Japanese culture, but outside of Japan, it’s still somewhat ambiguous and inaccessible, which makes it hard to enjoy sake if you’re trying it for the first time.",
