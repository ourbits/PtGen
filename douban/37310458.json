The investigator searches and finds no enemies. He understands that the Postman - that is the name of the young postman by the residents of the city - was the last to see the letter. The postman has been carrying letters since childhood; he is \"odd,\" but an exemplary postman. The townspeople sympathize with him, he belongs here. But what happened to the letter? And what is \"wrong\" here?",
