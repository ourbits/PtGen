    "introduction": "From Victor Hugo's classic French novel of the nineteenth century to Tom Hooper's award winning blockbuster this year, Les Misérables has undergone one of the most successful transitions from book to stage to screen. In this new documentary, the scintillating journey of Hugo's universal story is traced from book to stage to screen with contributions from many who have starred in or helped to create this entertainment phenomenon. Helmed by entertainment and celebrity journalist Neil Sean this insightful documentary traces the events of the Paris insurrection in 1832 and the storming of the barricades using the restored 1978 Les Miserables film starring Anthony Perkins. Also included are archive interviews with Frances Ruffelle, Hugh Jackman, Phil Jonas, Tom Hooper, Alfie Boe Amanda Seyfried, Sir Cameron Mackintosh and Anne Hathaway who recount the amazing story of why Les Misérables has captured a place in everyone's hearts and through all it's mediums.",
