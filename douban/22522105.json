    "introduction": "The City Addicted to Crystal Meth is a British documentary by Louis Theroux.[1] It was televised on 9 August 2009. Theroux filmed his documentary in Fresno, California which has one of the highest number of crystal meth users in the United States.[2]ReceptionThe documentary had mixed reviews.[3] The Times said \"Theroux risks becoming the Alan Whicker de nos jours, a tourist with a typewriter, peering into these other lives but rarely getting dirty himself.\"[4]The Dominion Post criticised Louis Theroux interviewing method \"...an increasingly grim-faced Theroux admitted he was at risk of becoming desensitised to the moving tide of human misery where the stories were a horrid template to be fitted over each twisted face.\"[5]The Guardian called the work \"an extraordinary film, a sad portrait of a very different California\"[1]",
