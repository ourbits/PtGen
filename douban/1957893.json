In various ways he tries to surmount this obstacle - always falling. Finally, in despair but not admitting defeat, he smashes a hole in the wall with his head, paying for victory with his life... Now all the other has to do is bend down a little to pass through the hole.His path is open - at least as far as the next wall...A wall blocks the path of two people. One man submits, while the other refuses to admit defeat. Finally the second man smashes a hole in the wall with his head, paying for the victory with his life.
