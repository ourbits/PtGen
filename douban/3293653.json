Team Cosmoranger J9 is assembled with Isaac Godonov, Blaster Kid, Steven Bowie, and Angel Omachi fighting the underworld scourge throughout the solar system. With the robot Braiger, they are a mercenary team that will handle any missions the police will not handle. Meanwhile, Earth has been divided into the four Connections of Omega, Red Dragon, Volga and Nubia while the other celestial bodies are divided into the five Connections of Galico (Jupiter), Viking (Mars), Venus, Uranus, and the Weapons Guild (Mercury). Through Khamen Khamen, Nubia hatches a plan to rule the solar system in which Jupiter is destroyed, leading to the creation of over 30 smaller planets that could sustain life. However, such a plan would lead to the destruction of Earth's inhabitants.",
