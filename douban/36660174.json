Childhood and adolescence poses many difficult and very important questions for each of the heroes, which they have to solve on their own.The girl Vika lives with her sick mother, whose sister Claudia dreams of getting their apartment by hook or by crook. For the most part, just the last ones. And so, Claudia’s daughter, Mila, moves into Vika’s house and begins to establish her own rules. Modest Vika fights for freedom in her own way: quietly, taciturnly, but persistently. One day, a boy appears at Mila's party. And from this moment on, Vika’s life becomes easier - because now she has a faithful friend who will not leave her in trouble.",
