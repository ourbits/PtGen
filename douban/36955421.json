    "introduction": "Transformation has no end; it will never be enough. This profound notion opens Endless, an extraordinary project by Wojciech Puś. Initiated in 2016, this artistic endeavor brings together non-binary, transgender, and queer individuals to explore their experiences beyond external definitions, redefining identity and corporeality with their unique idioms. In Endless, these explorations unfold through various media—performance, music, and VR—culminating in a hypnotic film that resembles a narcotic vision. At its core is the self-seeking X, portrayed by Szymon Czacki (Little Crushes, A Heart of Love). X engages in dialogues with his body and memories while forging new emotional and erotic connections: with the transgender Frank (Edmund Krempiński) and the enigmatic M (Josef Ostendorf), a collector of beauty. The narrative probes whether life can keep pace with art. The characters test the limits of self-transcendence and openness, including the collective experience of sexuality, moving towards a queer utopia where identities might finally meld into one.",
