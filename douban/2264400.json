    "introduction": "\"Mirror\" was born of a desire to explore human beauty in all it strange forms through the surreal medium of black-and-white computer graphics. \"Mirror\" was an organic creation, and was not storyboarded per se; instead, the film was created one shot at a time, often undergoing story shifts and revisions en route. Not the most efficient method of filmmaking, but quite an exciting and challenging one.",
