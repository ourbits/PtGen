    "introduction": "The storyline introduces us to Macarena, who grew up in a modest family that decided to emigrate to the USA when she was five years old. The teenage years of this charismatic, strong-willed girl with an attitude were somewhat complicated, but an unexpected turn managed to help her focus and find her feet: she decided to study Law. And Diana, a policewoman whom she meets during an internship, becomes the love of her life. Everything seems to be going as she had always dreamed it would, but her father triggers a sudden change in her life: Paco falls in love with a prostitute whom he gets pregnant, causing his family to descend into a complex spiral, both financially and emotionally. In order to move forward, Macarena agrees to act as a mule and transport goods from Los Angeles to Mexico. To do so, she goes online and books a car-sharing trip with Louis, the peculiar young “owner” of the vehicle.",
