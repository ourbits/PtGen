    "introduction": "This is the last part of a trilogy on racism and microaggressions. The audience is invited to join two women on their journey of discussing, avoiding, expressing, and ultimately fighting about these issues and the way they affect their everyday lives.---------------Indra finds that people constantly discriminate against her and judge her due to her skin color. With a humorous and critical perspective, Donkeyland puts into words structural racism through a contested narrative. --- Daniel Banati源自：https://program.goteborgfilmfestival.se/en/program/donkeyland",
