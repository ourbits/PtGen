A lockdown is announced and that sets to change lives for these families poignantly. Phase 1 of lockdown exposes the extramarital affair of Arjun's wife with Aru's husband, a neighbor. In phase 2 Sushma, pressurised by her son Akash, a TV journalist, forces Krishna to return the money that she had loaned him. Phase 3 brings to fore the conflict within Leela Seth, a lady in her late sixties, her daughter in law, Naina in her mid thirties and granddaughter, a teenager, Siya. Will all of them be able to emerge out of their situations with a brave spirit?",
