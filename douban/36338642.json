    "introduction": "In 2018, Chicago barber Harith “Snoop” Augustus is shot dead by police on his way to work. Incident first shows this shocking event from a distance, a view from above. This is followed by a chilling reconstruction based on footage from different angles and viewpoints, including surveillance cameras, and the dashboard cameras and bodycams of the officers present.At a certain point, different perspectives are combined in split-screen, intensely conveying the chaos, and the anger and desperation of the bystanders. Some know the victim. They see that he’s still breathing. Gradually a disconcerting picture unfolds not only of the shooting incident itself, but also of the immediate aftermath. Where do the priority’s of the police officers involved lie?源自：https://festival.idfa.nl/en/film/eca92ed1-9df6-4910-9227-ad58c2bf9d79/incident/",
