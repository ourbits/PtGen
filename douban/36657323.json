    "introduction": "The film features a short documentary element that recounts the historical significance of HOOVER DAM, and an acoustic set from Billy Idol and Steve Stevens - his friend and collaborator of 40 years - at the foot of the dam itself, before launching into the main event, which is a spectacular 75-minute sunset performance by Billy and guest stars with HOOVER DAM as the backdrop. This is the first Rock and Roll show ever performed - ergo filmed - at the iconic landmark, and is truly a Rock and Roll 'moment in time'. Billy's performance of JOHN WAYNE with ALISON MOSSHART is a highlight, and Steve Stevens performing the TOP GUN theme in the Black Canyon is a truly hair-raising moment. Other guest stars appearing on stage are Steve Jones (THE SEX PISTOLS) and Tony Kanal (NO DOUBT). Once in a lifetime stuff.",
