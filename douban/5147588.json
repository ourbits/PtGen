    "introduction": "Archie Andrews is a fickle, freckled fellow who's in a love triangle with the likeable Betty Cooper and the spoiled Veronica Lodge, a battle of wits with Reggie Mantle, and a friendship with Judghead Jones. Other characters include principal Mr. Weatherbee \"The Bee\" Big Ethel, who has a crush on Jughead, and the nerdy Dilton Doiley. Archie publishes an article in the school newspaper called \"Archie's Weird Mysteries\", which chronicles his exploits investigating strange phenomena. His adventures deal with time travelers, aliens, monsters (often creations of Dilton) and various other oddities. He also writes in his laptop journal at the end of every day, and always ends off his installment with the words: \"...in a little town called Riverdale.\"",
