    "introduction": "Mona is a young woman who grew up in an orphanage. He works for the Internet newspaper and has been reporting on the cases of house arson in different parts of Istanbul recently. Again, one day when he goes to the news of the fire, they come across the photo reporter Yakup, who came to do the same news. Although they secretly like each other, they bicker about because they have completely opposite characters. Returning from the news, Mona sees that the owner of the house, with whom she is already in a fight, has put her belongings in front of the door and is now homeless. Since her friend from the orphanage and now a police officer, Leyla, is on a secret mission, she has to accept as a temporary solution the offer of her new acquaintance Yakup to become a tenant in her house, which was later divided into two by a strange architecture. However, on the first day that Mona moves into the apartment, she realizes that strange things are going on in the Yuva Apartment. The neighbors, who act mysteriously, do not seem happy at all that he has moved into the apartment. It's clear that something extraordinary is going on inside, but before Mona has time to understand what's going on, she runs into an unexpected, serious problem.",
