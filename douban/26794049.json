    "introduction": "Grayson: Earth One\" season one is a non profit six episode season dedicated to exploring the origin story of the DC character known as Nightwing -- but with a twist. The twist being that Richard Grayson has never had the good fortune of being adopted as a child by Bruce Wayne, thus never becoming the boy wonder. Instead, we have a Richard Grayson that had to fend for himself on the unforgiving streets of Gotham and, even worse, the streets of Bludhaven. A character that has to overcome years of dog eat dog mentality to become a selfless and kind individual. To ultimately fulfill his destiny and become a HERO. Of course, changing that single event within Richard Grayson's life sends a ripple across the entire DC universe. It changes the history of characters such as Bruce Wayne, Barbara Gordon, Helena Bertinelli and their adversaries too",
