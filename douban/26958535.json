    "introduction": "There are eight underaged girls living together in the last house of a small village in Slavonia, trying to change their lives around with some help from the caretakers. The girls are growing up together, they take care of the household and manage the estate. Every week they get a visit from a professional drummer Branko Trajkov Trak who teaches them the art of drumming. The experience is still very hard for 14-year-old Ivana, who is struggling to adapt to the new environment. She has yet to learn to accept the past for what it was and to live for the future.",
