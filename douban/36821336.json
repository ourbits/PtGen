    "introduction": "\"Let the party begin\" is the story of the country's greatest film producer whose film wins at the Cannes Film festival. However, after two years of struggling through the corona virus crisis, difficulties with investors wanting their money back, films not distributed and a difficult divorce settlement, Jonathan must sell his company with all its assets. Unaware of the situation his new wife decides to throw him a surprise party to celebrate his win at Cannes, inviting all the heads of the local film industry, colleagues and family. When Jonathan finds out about it he decides to wire the whole house with cameras. Who among us wouldn't want to be a fly on the wall at his own party, to listen in to his guests conversations and to really hear what people think about him before his collapse. Jonathan watches the party and all that goes on through the monitors while at the same time liaising with his lawyer to save his business. Will he succeed?",
