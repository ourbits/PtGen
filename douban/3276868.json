It Shows a man sitting in a bathtub on a pier at the Hudson River with a background of the New York skyline. He is typing underwater with the words literally going down the drain. Opens the door, and a stripper wrapped in toilet paper appears, and attempts to seduce him. Neat jazz score by Cool Jazzmen Gerry Mulligan & Bob Brookmeyer.",
