Lala Kedarnath ignores the prediction and is busy making plans for an even wealthier future. He proclaims to his wife (Achala Sachdev) that he wants them to be even richer. As he talks of the day when people shout after his car, There goes Lala Kedarnath!!!!, there is a sudden earthquake and the whole town crumbles into ruins. When Lala Kedarnath regains consciousness, his house has been destroyed and his family is gone.The oldest son, Raju, ends up in an orphanage, while middle son, Ravi, (Sunil Dutt) is found on the road by a rich couple who takes him to their home to raise him as his own.

Unable to find the rest of the family, Laxmi and Vijay live in poverty.Lala Kedarnath finally traces Raju to the orphanage but finds that he has run away because the orphanage manager (Jeevan) beat him up. Frustrated, he kills the manager and is jailed. As the police drive away with Kedarnath, audience sees young Raju running in the streets and turning into an adult, (Raaj Kumar).There is lot of drama in the film and complex situations which succeeds in entertaining the audience.
