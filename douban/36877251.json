    "introduction": "Ten years after the coup that overthrew François Bozizé, the voices of local citizens resurface at the start of the current crisis in the Central African Republic, and are woven together with the memories of a Colombian correspondent in an account of a crucial moment in the country's history. Neighbours is a portrait of the dialogue interrupted by an invisible civil war, the testimony of the unease and resistance of those who face enemies as familiar as they are unexpected. The documentary brings together the voice of exile and the demand for the right to return.",
