    "introduction": "又一个未被发现的电影怪才,英国导演Philip Ridley只拍了三部影片其中还有一部是短片.这部<魔鬼与我同生>与<The Passion of Darkly Noon>都很喜欢.A young boy tries to cope with rural life circa 1950s and his fantasies become a way to interpret events. After his father tells him stories of vampires, he becomes convinced that the widow up the road is a vampire, and tries to find ways of discouraging his brother from seeing her. He must deal with an abusive mother, a father with a charge of molestation, a band of youths creating havoc, and an unforgiving environment in general.Sad that a director of Phillip Ridley's caliber and virtuosity has only done three films that are known of. And it is even more sad that this movie is actually quite hard to find and when found it is often dismissed as weird, sick trash. For those who dismiss this so quickly they are either not open-minded enough or not true movie fans. Granted the film is not for all tastes and it is one of a kind as far as plots are concerned. But what other film can you think of that involves exploding frogs, suicides by gas fire and \"vampire murders\" all in one film? Well I sure can't think of any off of the top of my head! Just see it...one will not be disappointed. If for nothing else watch it for the cinematography alone, it is exquisite to say the least.",
