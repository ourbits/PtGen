The latter catches them off-guard, kicks Will out and reveals incestuous feelings towards his daughter. Before Will leaves, he poisons the father's wine with a hallucinogenic drug. The father drinks it, falls asleep and the two lovers can escape. The father wakes up in time to see them leaving in a car and follows them, while falling victim to surrealistic hallucinations. Isabelle and Will drive to a park, leave the car and have sex. The father follows in his car, but falls into a delirium again. When he awakes, he sees the two and in an attack of incestuous jealousy, he runs them over. Devastated, he cries over his dead daughter.",
