    "introduction": "The video revolves around the theme of desire. Sitting at home on a stool at his upright piano, the artist is immersed in his thoughts while a voice-over tells the story of the Steinway & Sons grand piano and how very few pianists have the privilege to play this instrument. Wandering dejectedly through the streets of Amsterdam, he continues to think of the Steinway as he enters a musical instrument shop. In the next scene, a crane hoists the large piano through the window of the narrow room of his apartment. Here an entire chamber orchestra accompanies him in the performance of Chopin’s first piano concerto.源自：https://www.schermodellarte.org/en/film/nummer-zes-steinway-grand-piano-wake-me-up-to-go-to-sleep-and-all-the-color-of-the-rainbow/",
