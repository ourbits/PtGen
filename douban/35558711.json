    "introduction": "Surrounded by minefields and destruction from the Bosnian war and not welcome by everyone, thousands of migrants are still stranded in the northern part of the war-torn country. Their flimsy tents set up in the woods or abandoned socialist era buildings offer no protection from the harsh Bosnian winter. The food, clothes, firewood and communication are problems but nothing compared to the serious and constant violation of basic human rights these migrants are subjected to on a daily basis. In this visually driven film, Danis Tanović and Damir Šagolj show the brutality and inhumanity of the everlasting story of people “on the move” trying to reach the EU, where they are hoping for a better life. The question “do we remember “when we were them” is asked.",
