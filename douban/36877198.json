    "introduction": "A comprehensive, enthralling and aptly provocative portrait of the singer-songwriter, musician, poet, performance artist, visual artist and occultist known as Genesis P-Orridge.COUM Transmissions. Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth. Psychic TV. And, of course, Throbbing Gristle. These were just a few of the bands and collectives that Genesis Breyer P-Orridge led or was associated with. Gay Chorus Deep South director David Charles Rodrigues’ film is less a hagiography than an attempt to encompass the many lives, media and forms that this extraordinary figure of the avant garde embraced. With access to extraordinary archive footage – personal, public and performances – alongside appearances by William Burroughs, Brion Gyson, Timothy Leary, Alice Genese and David J, plus Nepalese monks, African witch doctors and a cameo by her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, the film also captures P-Orridge as they face their own mortality, an inevitability that they embrace with an striking degree of acuity.",
