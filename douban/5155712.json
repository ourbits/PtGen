    "introduction": "The Selkup people live along the Taz River in the Taymyr Peninsula. They are fishermen and hunters. The film documents the nomadic life of Yuri Kalin’s family. Finnish ethnographer Kai Donner, father of director Jörn Donner, who produced this film, described the language and culture of Selkups. His writings, as well as the books by Freud and Jung, and the music by Meredith Monk, were among the diverse inspirations for the filmmakers in their new expedition, in which they attempted to capture the transcendent behind rituals and a traditional way of living in a strong bond with the forest.源自：https://doclisboa.org/2023/en/filmes/the-sacrifice-a-film-about-a-forest/",
