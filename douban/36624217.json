    "introduction": "Malaysian Kah Wai is the only Asian director, who frequently films in the Balkan countries. He returns to Serbia for a third time to experiment with the illusion of time and memory. He impressively blurs the borders between past, present, future, reality, and archive footage.Genuine improvisation on the road with Japanese and local actors takes us from Belgrade to North Macedonia to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Kah Wai mixes testimonies of real witnesses of the Balkan War with minimalist sci-fi. Japanese superstar Shogen interprets the alter-ego of Kah Wai with a feeling of having lived in the Balkans. Director Jay mysteriously disappears in 2019 and leaves behind a hard disc with the film “No Where, Now Here”. Actress Eva follows his steps to find him after she met Jay at the film shoot in 2018 film.Edvinas Pukšta源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/everything-everywhere/",
