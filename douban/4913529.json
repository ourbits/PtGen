    "introduction": "LEGACY' describes a day in the life of Bissie Hapgood (Joan Hotchkis, 'BREEZY,' 'THE ODD COUPLE'), a compulsive, neurotic, inconsiderate, self aborbed rich matron who is trapped by a loveless marriage, a guilt ridden relationship with her senile mother, and her obsession with order and material possessions. Her troubled life is presented, both past and present, through flashbacks, as she slowly decends into madness.Based on Hotchkis' play and directed with 'energy, style and control' (L.A. Times) by Karen Arthur ('LADY BEWARE,' 'THE MAFU CAGE'), 'LEGACY' was critically acclaimed uponits release, but vanished from sight for years.Never available on home video untilnow, Scorpion Releasing proudly presents this lost film so viewers can once again get into the world of Bissie Hapgood, if you dare.",
