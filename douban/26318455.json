    "introduction": "When lighting technician Watanabe Shō retired, his wife Tomiko started showing the first signs of Alzheimer’s disease. In order to learn how to better accompany and care for her, he kept a film diary of her daily life. Documentary filmmaker Satō Makoto edited this film from years of footage shot by Watanabe, resulting in this moving exercise in intimacy and care. By focusing on the small, unnoticed details, the small everyday gestures, as well as the textures of the images, Satō’s extraordinary montage work evokes Watanabe’s tender love for Tomiko.",
