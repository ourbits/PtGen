    "introduction": "A guy travels to find the scenery portrayed in the painting that his mother left. However, there is old legend brought after Japanese Invasion of Korea, that no eyes of destruction can find the scenery. After all, he gets lost in woods, a bird attacks his eye… The plot of The Origin of Water was formed when the director taking a walk by Namhan River in his hometown Chungg-ju, saw the grave of an innocent college student killed during ‘6.3 Sate’ (Material Law in Korea). It is ironic to see that the politicians who were responsible for the death of many students from that period of time are now planning to destroy the river and few people remember what happened before..",
