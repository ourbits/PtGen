    "introduction": "Genre Sub Genre is an experimental video work, included in the movie and photography project hosted by Nusa Tenggara Timur Museum of Indonesia. Dominated by mystic mood, this black and white film is divided into 3 illustrations. These follow as young men who had driven loaded Jeep deep in the night, some kids playing football under a tree while the blazing sun overlooks, and a voyage of a paper-made boat which is floating on the river. An indonesian experimental movie maker Yosep Anggi Noen contrasts realistic night images and dreamlike daytime images, without presenting the corelation of separated illustrations. The beautiful last scene is astonishingly impressive when the giant paper boat travels away on the screen. (Jang Byungwon)",
