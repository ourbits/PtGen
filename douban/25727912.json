    "introduction": "Recently-widowed Leann and her 17-year-old daughter Julina move into an isolated polygamous compound, where the freethinking Julina meets like-minded Ryder, son of the religious compound’s charismatic Prophet, Ervil. Immediately drawn to one another, the two begin to secretly meet and soon fall in love. Threatened by his son’s budding attraction to Julina, Ervil claims God has instructed him to take Julina as his new wife so they can build a new community in Mexico. When Ryder and Julina learn of Ervil’s intent to destroy their relationship, they begin to plan their escape. However, Ervil intercedes and banishes Ryder from the sect, leaving him in a remote area of the desert so he can no longer endanger his plan to marry Julina. Wandering for miles, Ryder arrives in Las Vegas, where he finds his old friend and excommunicated “lost boy” Micah and enlists his help to rescue Julina. Back at the compound, Leann and her sister-wives also begin to realize Ervil’s role as Prophet is not as sacred as they originally believed and set out to save Julina and reunite her with her true love, Ryder.",
