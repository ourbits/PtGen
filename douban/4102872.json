He returns to his deserted hometown after living in Germany for thirty years to sort out the remainder of his life. Meandering through time， he delineates a pictorial memoir. He recalls his playmate Young-Ae， his benign mother ravaged by disease， and his father killed by the Japanese for having an affair with a Japanese woman. Then unexpectedly， recollecting his sombre past， he encounters an exorcist and shaman-girl.",
