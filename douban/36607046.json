    "introduction": "It starts with insults, discrimination at work, harassment by the police. When stalkers sent by the government go from threats to assault, one must seek safety in a faraway country. The film documents the experiences of several Sudanese refugees arriving in Switzerland during the 1990s: fastidious transfers from one shelter to another; repetitive hearings with the commissions in charge of asylum seekers; account settlements with the social services that are as incomprehensible as they are meticulous; and the laborious integration in a different society, even when all parties go about it with a lot of goodwill. The refugees are just asking for safety; but the Swiss authorities demand a weighty counterpart to that plea.",
