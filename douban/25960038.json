    "introduction": "Navarana is a Polar Eskimo elder who lives in the most remote corner of the planet, the northwest tip of Greenland. Her ancestor a shaman who led a legendary migration, Navarana knows she is connected by blood to a group of Canadian Inuit. Wondering what life is like for her distant cousins in today's Arctic, she sets out on hunting journeys in both her homeland and on Baffin Island. And while discovering that these isolated groups of Inuit share much in common, Navarana also witnesses striking differences in lifestyle between Greenlanders and Canadians. At a time when her people are up against vast and inescapable challenges, Navarana looks for the way forward and considers what has been lost and what has been gained.",
