His book-thumping AA sponsor, Fred, offers him refuge at his farm, where Matt finds Yup'ik, a stray Husky with a unique talent. The man and dog relationship is precarious at first, but with the help of a close-knit Montana community, the two strays find a connection and discover what it takes to pull through to the finish line.",
