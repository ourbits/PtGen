    "introduction": "After Twilight Chapter 1’s huge box-office hit, American filmmaker Catherine Hardwicke tried to make an adaptation of The Monkey Wrench Gang by Edward Abbey, a cult book of the 70s American counterculture and a precursor of eco-activism. The director revisits this project which excited her so much and which became, because of the reluctance of the Hollywood studios, one of these umpteenth “ghosts of the garage”.",
