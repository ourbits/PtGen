    "introduction": "The 1995 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 49th season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1995 FIA Formula One World Championship, which was contested over 17 races from 26 March to 12 November 1995. For the second year in succession, the Drivers' Championship was won by Michael Schumacher, the Benetton driver defeating Damon Hill of Williams by 33 points. Benetton-Renault won their first and only Constructors' Championship, defeating Williams-Renault by 29 points.The season was highlighted by the rivalry between Schumacher and Hill, with Schumacher winning nine races and Hill winning four races. Benetton and Williams drivers dominated the field, victorious in all but one race, the Canadian GP won by Jean Alesi in a Ferrari. During the season, Ferrari proved to be very competitive in most races but bad luck and some reliability issues prevented both drivers winning more than one race. Ferrari also pulled off a coup when signing double champion Schumacher for the 1996 season. Jean Alesi, Johnny Herbert (Benetton Renault) and David Coulthard (Williams Renault) all won their first races in F1.",
