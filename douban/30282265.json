But, as the best friend and unofficial Guardian to the Chosen One, she will have to work hard to prove that she can live up to expectations as the first and only human Guardian. While training and studying, Andi is also in charge of getting a couple of the Academy's toughest witches and wizards-in-training to graduation day, with Jessie (Jax's little sister) being one of them. She also meets other Guardians-in-training, like Luke (Lily's cousin), who becomes her love interest, Ruby, who becomes her rival, and Kim, who becomes her best friend.",
