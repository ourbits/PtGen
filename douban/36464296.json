    "introduction": "After many years away and an ultimately only modestly successful career in the London Britpop scene, the musician HELEN, 50, returns to the small village on the Danube where she grew up. Here she takes temporary charge of HAPPYLAND, her mother’s community sports hall, and soon she encounters the ghosts of her youth: the former members of her old band. These days they are all well integrated into provincial life and long ago stopped yearning for a career in show business; the fact that their own dreams came to nothing doesn’t stop them from ridiculing Helen when she returns, feeling a failure. The only person who clearly doesn’t want to make fun of Helen is TOM (50), the love of her life. She abandoned him when she moved to London, and today he makes a living by renting out stage and sound equipment. Tom is married to SILVIA (45), who was also once in their band, and he attempts to approach life with a pragmatic attitude. As a result of his outstanding musical abilities when he was younger and the natural coolness that he still possesses, he has become quite a local hero. Tom has never forgiven Helen for abandoning him and their band. Helen is determined to engineer a meeting – but Tom is a master at evasion. Despite the idyllic surroundings of her home village, Helen feels alien here and suffers from the dull agony of failure … until she encounters another outsider, JOE (22), who seems to have a punk-style affinity for horse breeding and is devoting himself to this far from promising vocation with the same passion Helen once reserved for her musical career. Helen feels magically drawn to Joe and starts ambushing him at every opportunity, succumbing to dreams of a loving relationship. Joe soon finds this oppressive but turns her interest to his own advantage. Tom’s daughter JANIS (20) works at the HAPPYLAND reception desk – temporarily, she insists. While she admires Helen she actually believes she is far more talented as a singer and is determined to make it big in the pop business. When Helen hears her singing at a party in the community hall, she’s close to tears, feeling older than ever. But now at last she comes face to face with Tom, and they talk things through … which changes everything.",
