    "introduction": "Judith, an investigative journalist, begins to unravel a murder mystery that implicates one of her current lovers. When she checks out a peep-show business on the seedy side of Hamburg as part of the investigation, she runs into a former boyfriend who used to be a psychiatrist but is now an arms dealer. Judith is lured back into his fold, cheating on her current lovers, one of whom is also a shrink. Despite her profession, or perhaps because of it, Judith tends to blend fantasy and reality, so small wonder she is attracted to psychoanalysts. But, two shrinks and a murder prove more than Judith can handle.\"Valie Export's third feature is an anti-romance in which the heroine, oscillating between two relationships,gradually discovers that both are impossible, not because the subjective processes of \"love\" are defective,but because the objective, social matrix in which both her male lovers operate is corrupt, immoral, murderous:in this film, the male world and its power structures cancel the possibility of love beyond the matter of sexuality,that is the objectification of love. Export makes use of techniques drawn from her earlier experimental cinema,video and conceptual photography to expand the possibilities of narrative feature filmmaking and to disintegratesome of its overdetermined conventions.\"Video control in subway stations and in street traffic, tapes and cameras are very importantfor the structure of the film. Mediocrity, hypocrisy and violence are the film's main themes.Valie Export deals with them on private, social and media levels, adhering to the techniquesof video avant-garde.",
