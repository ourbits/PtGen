To illuminate its importance, the Juice team traveled 60,000 miles to gather 40 on-camera interviews with people from seven countries on five continents. Juice shows how electricity explains everything from women's rights and climate change to Bitcoin mining and indoor marijuana production. Juice explains who has electricity, who's getting it, and how developing countries all over the world are working to bring their people out of the dark and into the light.",
