    "introduction": "Told with a light touch and sense of humor, this short documentary is comprised of snapshots of household dinners from across an array of cultural backgrounds, family arrangements and economic circumstances. Meals are prepared, tables are set, children are fed and entertained, and exhausted adults chat in snippets. This VR experience allows us to take a \"place at the table,\" where so much of the inner workings of family life play out. There, conversations turn to daily routines, discussions of money and missing parents, to wishes and plans for future celebrations, and prayers are said. The documentary also draws attention to the unseen work of the care that's involved in the sustenance of a family, as well as to the significance of those familiar exchanges we all have around food that we might otherwise take for granted.",
