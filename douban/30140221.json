    "introduction": "Wandering Star, the second film by the Galician Alberto Gracia, starts with a text about the punk band Los Fiambres, which made just one cult record in 1984: El lado oscuro del R & R (The Dark Side of Rock & Roll). Gracia follows Los Fiambres vocalist Rober Perdut more than thirty years later. He meets a photographer for a photo session in a bus station, is looking for drugs and loses someone named Roni (Rober’s surname does not coincidentally mean ‘disappeared, lost’). Rober sniffs coke from a Johnny Cash CD and is sailed to an island. In other scenes, we follow the photographer, who sometimes disappears mysteriously.In this film dedicated to horror director George Romero, as punk as it is free, Gracia creates an alienating atmosphere, especially thanks to the soundtrack. We hear threatening drones, phrases from a self-help tape ('I love myself') and of course delightful punk songs, including Droga, droga droga, Los Fiambres's ode to (freely available) drugs.",
