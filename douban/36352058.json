    "introduction": "In 2018, Apichatpong Weerasethakul made a film called BLUE. In it, actress Jenjira Pongpas Widner is unable to sleep. She is in a bed surrounded by banana trees. Nearby, a set of traditional theater backdrops unspools, revealing two alternate landscapes: a sunset over the sea and the foyer of a royal palace. Later on, her lack of sleep seems to set the place on fire. A flicker of personal and social recollections lingers on throughout the night. Similarly, ON BLUE reflects on the past years as we appear to have slept through the pandemic. Perhaps we are ready to wake up. ON BLUE was inspired by the moments of awakening, of sunrise. When first light reaches the eyes, there is a profound sense of clarity. The color blue was giving way to the the morning gold. Dream and reality coexist, memories and conditionings fade. Even the word \"blue\" has lost its meaning. In an instant, we are newborns with no ties to anything.",
