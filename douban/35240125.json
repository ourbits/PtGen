    "introduction": "Heidelberg, 1894. Psychiatric patient Marie Lieb creates mesmerising patterns on the floor of her cell using only torn up bed sheets. 120 years later, an unnamed artist stumbles upon two photographs of these floor drawings. They are accompanied only by a medical diagnosis, \"mania\". Marie Lieb's medical file is missing. The enigmatic designs keep pulling her back. Who was Marie Lieb, and what message do her works carry across time? And who took the photographs and why? The artist is embroiled in a mystery story in which she is the detective. She consults an encyclopaedia of symbols as well as the oddly titled \"Atlas of Psychiatry\". She closely examines the prints for clues but finds only a trace in time - a footprint in the dust. Finally, a strange coincidence leads her to Marie Lieb's medical file. Will its contents provide the answers she's looking for, the thread to the heart of the labyrinth?",
