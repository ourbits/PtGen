    "introduction": "Fluffy animals with a friendly crowd are engaged in the cultivation of carrots. There is no time to rest, because autumn is coming soon, and winter is behind it. Tasty and juicy carrots are necessary for survival in severe frost. Only one protagonist, a shaggy little rabbit in short shorts, wanders aimlessly around the garden. \"If carrots were to grow on a special carrot tree,\" he dreams, \"and all the hares would have special mechanical wings, hooked and flew to the fruit.\" \"You do not have to work, you know, fly to yourself all day, throw off the carrot into the basket.\" Written by Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com)",
