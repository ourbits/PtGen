    "introduction": "As the title suggests, this film is serene and contemplative in the way that it portrays drifts, solitude, and mysteries in life with a calm voice. Yoonchul is a sculptor, but he mostly makes living with an interior design job. He is divorced, and his daughter fails to fit into the school life and is considered a troublemaker, although she shows much talent in art, like her father. One day, Yoonchul meets an attractive woman, Youngji, and falls in love with her. The characters in the film stay calm when they face critical moments in their lives. They show dignity even when they have sudden attacks or tragic turns. This film provides a chance to experience time of deep contemplation with its careful performance, elegant structure and cinematography, and mature attitude. (JUNG Hanseok)",
