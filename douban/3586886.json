    "introduction": "Isabel Sarli - 阿根廷永远的性感女神！！！Isabel Sarli born Hilda Isabel Sarli Gorrindo Tito (July 9, 1935 in Concordia, Entre Ríos, Argentina) is a retired Argentine actress, and model and a sex-symbol of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.Nicknamed La Coca (just a family alias until the press notes), Sarli was discovered by filmmaker Armando Bo after she became Miss Argentina in 1955 (who she married) and became the star of his films, starting with El Trueno entre las hojas in 1956. Her nude scenes in this --a first in Argentine cinema-- and their subsequent sexploitation movies were highly criticized and condemned in Argentina. In spite of censorship and persecution, she became an international Latin American star, filming in Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela, and films like Fuego (1969 film) and Fiebre (1970) reached the American and European markets.Bo later insisted in casting her in naturalistic melodramas. After his death in 1981, Isabel Sarli retired from the cinema industry altogether but came back in the mid-nineties for Jorge Polaco's film La Dama Regresa.",
