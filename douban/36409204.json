    "introduction": "A work in on-going progress. Painted, filmed and edited by Jo Ann Kaplan, documenting and reflecting on the artist's own aging, to be up-dated and developed at points in the future. The actual face, glimpsed occasionally, is getting older and more lined over time, but the record of its aging is not yet long enough to bear full witness. A self-portrait of the artist as an aging woman, and a work in progress to be continued for as long as there is time.",
