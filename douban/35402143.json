    "introduction": "The new short by Sandro Aguilar completes a fascinating diptych with the previous Jewels (seen last year at Bafici) and, like that one, it asks us to use reason and imagination in order to run away from the comfort zone the contemporary audience has settled in. Over images -amazing, as always- of caged monkeys, bugs preserved in formaldehyde and a planetarium, we hear texts on the planet’s first inhabitants, the rules of a video game about spaceships or an instruction manual for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. And the choice, there’s no doubt about it, isn’t capricious.",
