    "introduction": "Determined to discover the present Cuban's essence, the filmmaker and her crew take a ride on one of the oldest and most popular cars called \"almendrones\", a legendary 1948 Chevrolet, used by locals to move around in the city. The car seats are shared by a teacher, an actor, a \"santera\" (a Caribbean which), a young writer, an old Havana rascal, a priest, a driver, a \"jinetero\" (a person who takes advantages of tourists), a peanut seller and a violinist. A group of people that have never set eyes on each other but, spontaneously, engage and talk about their lives and concerns... so distant and yet so close",
