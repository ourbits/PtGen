    "introduction": "Bedsitters is set on the landing and stairs of Zwartjes' new house, then still empty, in The Hague. The film maker suggests a mysterious and complex space by using a 'floating' camera to film a number of crawling, creeping personages. When when Zwartjes is in the picture himself, the camera keeps floating. The flowing movement and impressive wide-angle lens turn the house into a building that resists logic. It seems, as in a modern computer game, to have several levels. With Armand Perrenet, Moniek Toebosch and Trix Zwartjes.",
