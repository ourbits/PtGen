    "introduction": "A young girl with a special gift struggles to overcome a mob boss' influence over her family in this dark Dust Bowl fantasy, inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Little Mermaid.\"“Charlotte is a young girl coming of age in the midst of one of the most desolate and desperate periods in American history. The untimely death of her mother triggers a downward spiral for her father, five sisters and their family-run song and dance act. Help comes from an unlikely source when a gangster named Randall offers to pay off their debt in exchange for making some unsavoury changes to the family business. Matters are complicated when it is discovered that Charlotte, like her mother before her, is in fact a mermaid capable of controlling humans with her voice. What follows is a sophisticated magical turf war in which antagonists from many camps seek to take advantage of Charlotte's power. The best and worst of humanity are put on display and Charlotte must choose her own path, knowing that the wrong decision will have deadly consequences for the people she loves.”",
