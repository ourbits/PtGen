    "introduction": "War reaps unthinkable suffering not only on combatants, but also on civilian populations. Not only did allied attacks wreck cities and decimate families, but the civilians themselves drowned in fascist rhetoric and under psychological manipulation committed deeply saddening acts of self-destruction that extended to Japan's most vulnerable This unprecedented documentary shines a light on the people of Japan who endured a torment unprecedented in human history that reverberates across society and explains why Japanese cling to peace to this day.",
