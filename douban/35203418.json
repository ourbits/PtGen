    "introduction": "A meditation on urban green spaces and the post-industrial cityscape, Up On The Farm explores Brooklyn Grange, a one-acre rooftop organic farm in New York City. Connecting the built and natural environments, this video documents an imaginative experiment in green urban redevelopment, and takes a look at an attempt to transform the roof of a century-old former factory into a sustainable, pastoral haven.",
