Waleed, a wheeler-dealer from Gaza, accepts a fast-cash job smuggling a British man out of the country. Complications arise when the man’s Israeli girlfriend tags along, and Waleed finds himself stuck with these fugitives hiding in his basement for longer than he’d hoped. Palestinian vigilantes, the Israeli army, and Waleed’s prying neighbours are all after them. With all odds stacked against him, Waleed has to act fast to take advantage of any opportunity to get them out of Gaza.",
