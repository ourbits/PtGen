    "introduction": "Sofia moves to London to audition for ballet companies and hide from her past. Hard up and desperate, she has to give lessons to make ends meet. Her first clients are Caroline and Daniel, seemingly model to-be-weds, but it is soon clear that all is not well. While Caroline is obsessed with the perfect wedding, her fiancee can't dance - or won't, for reasons that go deeper than just two left feet. As the lessons progress, Daniel sees Sofia as a confidante, a temptation, and maybe more. Through dance, both are forced to question what art, intimacy and partnership mean to them. Daniel has to face his wedding day, and Sofia must decide whether dance is worth more to her than other people.",
