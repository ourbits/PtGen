    "introduction": "Joyce Poole fell in love with wild Africa when she was only seven years old. As a scientist working in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro, she made discoveries that changed the way we look at elephants. Joyce confirmed that African male elephants go into a state of musth, a period of heightened sexuality and aggressiveness, and she was on the forefront of the discovery that elephants communicate with each other.",
