    "introduction": "Would I Lie to You? (often abbreviated to WILTY) is a comedy panel game made by Zeppotron for BBC One. It was first broadcast on 16 June 2007.The show was presented by Angus Deayton in 2007 and 2008, and by Rob Brydon (who had appeared as a guest panellist in the second series) from 2009 onwards.[1] The team captains are comedians David Mitchell and Lee Mack.For each show, two celebrity guests join each of the team captains. The two teams then compete with each player revealing unusual facts and embarrassing personal tales for the consideration of the opposing team. Some of these are true; some are not, and panellists’ task is to decide which is which.The first series was recorded at The Fountain Studios in Wembley during March and April 2007, and aired at 21:55 between 16 June and 28 July 2007 on BBC One (missing a week for coverage of the Concert for Diana memorial event).",
