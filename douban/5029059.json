    "introduction": "About montage, folding and transformation pictures, myrioramas and much more.Alongside perspective and the creation of the illusion of movement, montage is already a central aspect in the early history of visual media. Pictures or sections of pictures are placed in a relationship to one another in the order to give the pictures a new meaning.Already, in the sixteenth century, there were predecessors of the techniques of montage, used today in films. An example is the folding picture montage, where half pictures combined with pictures beneath, present a new picture each time.Through combination of the pictures it is possible to assemble different versions.Other examples of early montage forms are transparencies, picture puzzles and transformation pictures which draw the gaze towards hidden information.In the myriorama, the mulri-thousand picture-show, it is possible to assemble a never-ending landscape. The pictured world which results from this montage game is infinitely variable.",
