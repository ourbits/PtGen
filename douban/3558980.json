In the months leading up to this historic election, filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi (HBO's Emmy®-winning \"Journeys with George\") took a road trip to meet some of the conservative Americans who waited in line for hours to support the GOP ticket, and saw their hopes and dreams evaporate in the wake of that Democratic victory. These voters share their feelings about the changing America in which they live.",
