    "introduction": "A look into the lives of the women and girls who inhabit the seaside town of Wildwood, New Jersey.This film takes you down the shore with an all-women crew to Wildwood, NJ, the last great American blue-collar seaside carnival town.Wildwood, NJ moves beyond gum-cracking, big hair and press-on nails to look into the souls of women raised on the boardwalk rides, lights and come-ons.Grandmothers and go-go girls who work as vampires in boardwalk haunted houses. Tween girls stretching out on their first trip without their parents: young, rangy, a little drunk on Bud, dukes up, nose open, with a cuppla' bucks to burn.A Wildwood honeymoon, virginity lost to a boardwalk stranger, fistfights, madness, babies--and no matter what--returning to Wildwood year after year as they grow up and grow old.This film was shot in 1994 on Super-8 film and synched frame by frame in the early days of non-linear editing.",
