    "introduction": "A country in upheaval – young filmmakers offer their personal perspective on this historical period. It is a coming-together of avant-garde aesthetics, theory, politics and playfulness. Again and again, the filmmakers take to the streets with their cameras, like Wim Wenders does in ›Same Player Shoots Again‹ or Adolf Winkelmann in ›Adolf Winkelmann, Kassel 9.12.1967. Meanwhile, in ›Der Bräutigam, die Komödiantin und der Zuhälter‹, Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet stage a play featuring Rainer Werner Fassbinder and his Action-Theater (as well as the Landsberger Strasse in Munich), whereas Günter Peter Straschek probes the divide between left-wing intellectuals and the working proletariat in ›Zum Begriff des 'kritischen Kommunismus' bei Antonio Labriola (1843-1904)‹. The program concludes with Birgit and Wilhelm Hein's ›Rohfilm‹, a brilliant destruction of the ‘real’ film image.Günter Peter Straschek was a filmmaker and historian as well as one of the greatest experts on film emigration from Nazi Germany.",
