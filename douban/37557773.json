    "introduction": "An old man tries to return to the homeland of his childhood torn by war. A young man tries to reach the moon. Both impossible paths intertwine to remind us that the journey has no end. Out of Here is a hybrid between fiction and reality. Is a unique story from the Spanish Civil War, back in 1937. In these time a group of children known as 'The children of Russia' were forced to live in exile. Our protagonist, Ángel, is an old man caught in the memory of that lost childhood. At the same time a young architect dreams of reaching the moon. Where are we when we travel? That time doesn't exist.",
