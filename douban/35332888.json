    "introduction": "A young couple from the US, struggling with their marriage, decides to move to Mexico. As liberal artists, they seek inspiration and freedom in a new country ready to be discovered. But the reality is far from what they are imagining.They have in their minds an idea for a film title (such a sarcastic reference), and they are not aware of how the colonial impact has affected the representation between countries. Every new episode the couple is facing shows them as ridiculous(ly funny) characters in a landscape they only see through a screen.Crime, comedy, and a love for underground cinema mix together in an offbeat story that offers a sharp and satiric statement on contemporary cultural dynamics. No problemo, Mexico is all that you need, amigo.Javier Garcia Puerto源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/good-savage/",
