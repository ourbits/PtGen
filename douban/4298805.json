At the same time an actress, Iris refuses to \"die\" in a casting, which in turn piques the interest of the director. She returns to her east Village apartment she shares with another actress, \"Mira\" who is desperate for fame whatever the price. Iris retreats in her room, seemingly setting off a trend of people saying no, one of them being Kurt who disappears from the movie being shot outside her house. As Iris searches for something real, in the city and in herself, Lamont sets off a wave where the real nobodies step out and into control.",
