    "introduction": "Set in the pre-Stonewall New York City of the late 1960s, Open City explores characters from disparate corners of Manhattkajganichan as they navigate the cultural revolutions and political turmoil of the era, including the unlikely alliance between the Mafia and the city’s gay community in the opening of a West Village nightclub. Ronnie Lorenzo, one of the original owners of the Stonewall Inn, the epicenter of the 1969 Stonewall riots that sparked America’s gay rights movement, is aboard as a consulting producer.",
