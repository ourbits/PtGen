    "introduction": "\"WHAT HAPPENED AFTER 1986?\"20 YEARS. 20 FILMS. 20 FILMMAKERS. 1 NATION.IMAHE NASYON... a groundbreaking, conceptual omnibus film by 20 alternative filmmakers who were tasked to present their personal visions on national issues. It is underlined by a conceptual question asked by line producers Jon Red & Carol Bunuan-Red:\"How do you see the past 20 years?\"In 2006, IMAHE NASYON attempts to answer the question. That question also became a thematic and uniting thread across the films, but each film is made of different cinematic genres that isrepresentative of the filmmaker's style, stressing the concept that in spite of individual visions we share the same goal: to depict a truthful image of the nation.The omnibus project was conceptualized by Jon and Carol in commemoration of Edsa 1, a political revolution that changed their generation forever. It is also a celebration of the struggle andgrowth of Philippine Independent Cinema which, in essence, is a cultural revolution only now gaining public acceptance.A unique and common element in IMAHE NASYON is rising Indie actor PING MEDINA who is featured in all the 20 films. He represents the next generation who will play a crucial role in the direction of the nation and its image.Imahe Nasyon was directed by Poklong Anading, Emman Dela Cruz, Yeye Calderon, Neil Daza, Lav Diaz, Tad Ermitaño, Mes de Guzman, Rox Lee,Topel Lee, Milo Paz, Robert Quebral, Ellen Ramos, Raymond Red, R.A.Rivera, Lyle Sacris, EJ Salcedo, Sig Sanchez, Dennis Empalmado, Ogi Sugatan, Paolo Villaluna",
