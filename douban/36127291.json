    "introduction": "Ella is a costume designer who is involved in a long-term relationship with Assaf, a respected but married playwrigth. When Assaf dies unexpectedly, she is the last to hear about it. Everyone knows that she was Assaf’s mistress, but no one thought she would dare to show up at his house alongside the other mourners. During the Shiva (seven days of mourning according to Jewish tradition), Ella keeps coming every day. She gets closer and closer to Natasha, Assaf's widow, and intimately close with Dan, his brother, who reminds her of her dead lover. It all ends abruptly when Natasha realizes who Ella is.Ma'ayan Rypp takes a look into the complexity of relationships and gives a powerful point of view of the other woman in the relationship. Often painted in society as the villain, the home wrecker whose feelings should be downgraded even when tragedy hits, this film shows us her side, her feelings and grief, all in the vein of a dramedy.源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/the-other-widow/",
