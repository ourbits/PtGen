    "introduction": "While preparing to shut down the photo studio business that he has been running, a man (Yoon Jemoon) hears that someone named Chulsu has died. The man contacts several friends in the hope of finding to attend the funeral with him. Usu is a film in which an image of a man, sunk in depression, is printed on a screen. It is not important who Chulsu is. It looks as if the man traces back his past, but the film refuses to give any concrete explanation. Instead, it carves abstract emotions onto a refined screen. Characters are placed in the multi-layered frames and are as quiet as paintings. Leisurely paced, the film captures them as they are buried in darkness while conversations, that look absent-minded yet incisive, add vitality to the slow and contemplative rhythm. The half serious and half playful lines sound like an extended joke about loneliness. Usu is a drama that resembles a carefully staged photograph. It casts its shadow of sorrow and loneliness upon those who watch it. (SONG Kyung-won)",
