    "introduction": "NASA’S UNEXPLAINED FILES dives into the mysteries of some of NASA’s most curious missions to explore stories of engineering achievement and human endurance. Each episode offers first hand testimony from astronauts, NASA mission footage, plus beautifully rendered CGI to bring to life these voyages that reveal unexplained sightings that have dogged many of NASA’s most famous missions. The series also helps puts age-old UFO conspiracies to rest and celebrates the science that has kept us in space for over half a century.NASA's Unexplained Files : Programs : Science Channel : Discovery Press Webhttps://press.discovery.com/us/sci/programs/nasas-unexplained-files/",
