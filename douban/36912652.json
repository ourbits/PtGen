    "introduction": "In Everson’s mesmerizing black-and-white diptych (hence “dual”), actor-musician Ricky Goldman (seen in Everson and Claudrena N. Harold’s Gospel Hill, First Look 2023) incarnates Eddie Hazel, the virtuoso lead guitarist of George Clinton’s Funkadelic. As he performs both the rhythm and lead parts of the soloist’s legendary “Maggot Brain,” Goldman and Everson seek out the generative spark, perhaps a legendary manipulation by Clinton, that led Hazel to play with such passion.",
