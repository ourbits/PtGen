    "introduction": "A father and son set out on a trip to the Balmoral Art Institute. The father seeks a job for himself, but also hopes to convince the Institute’s director to offer a residency to his son, an aspiring composer. Shortly after they arrive, the father must deal with competition from a strange, hostile man as his son, revolted by the Institute, leaves. That’s when he turns to writing letters to his son to express his deepest thoughts. As the days and months go by and his time at the Institute drags on, he starts to lose his sense of identity. Federico Hidalgo’s latest opus features his usual meticulous, cryptic narrative construction and signature sublime visuals along with striking sound design.",
