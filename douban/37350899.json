    "introduction": "Filming is alchemy; preserving, seeing, devouring, cutting. Chopping the flow of images with a push of a button. It privileges a solitary unseen protagonist, choosing this over that and then that, it eats anything, not everything. The world hacked into fragments, jumps, frames. Kidnapped buildings gestures people animals happening now, again now, again now. The displacement of what was once to what is now seen carries the odor of end, regardless of the incessant movement of one frame to the next, a machine forcing the celluloid frames forced to run, jump, trip, turning it all into a sad slapstick -- slapstick also embodies heartbreak. A meeting with an old friend, possibly for the last time. [Or] a throwback to a kind of film I never made. But if I did, it would be a noisy film with silence.—Shelly Silver",
