    "introduction": "很著名的南斯拉夫经典爱情片。本片是Milena Dravic和Ljubisa Samardzic的成名作，后来各自成为前南最著名的男女演员，Milena Dravic出演了黑浪潮一代的众多作品，而Ljubisa Samardzic最深入人心的角色还是在《瓦尔特保卫萨拉热窝》里的精彩表演。Milena Dravic因本片而首次获得普拉国家电影节最佳女演员奖。Young Mikajilo and his girlfriend Malena attend yet another work action. This time Mikajilo meets a student Nada and falls in love with her. Malena, who has many times before gone after Mikajilo even though she was not needed in work actions, is left behind. Mikajilo's flirting with Nada provokes general laughter and ridicule and the ambitious \"Don Juan\" returns to his brigade and his old girlfriend.This very popular romantic comedy, Prekobrojna, was the first of Bauer's excursions to Serbian film and his first film that was shot in cinemascope. This excursion was somewhat forced by circumstances since no one had shown any interest for it in Jadran Film of Zagreb. In this charming film Bauer once again proved himself an outstanding director of actors. Bauer launched many young and previously little-known (Milena Dravic) or nearly unknown (Ljubisa Samardzic) actors to stardom in this film. At the Pula Film Festival Prekobrojna won the third award as Best film and the Golden Arena for Best Actress. It was shown at the film festival in Karlovy Vary.Branko Bauer ranked among the former Yugoslavia's most influential filmmakers. He specialized in socially conscious films and emotional stories about children; several of his children's stories have been honored at major European film festivals. On television, Bauer directed Yugoslavia's most popular television series, Zimovanje u Jakobsfeldu/Wintering in Jacosfeld (1975), the ongoing story of an orphaned boy who finds safety in a Pannonic village during WWII. This series made its young star, Slavko Stimac, a national icon. Bauer studied medicine and veterinary science before becoming a filmmaker, making documentaries and newsreels at Jadran Films. Bauer's most famous film is Licem u Lice/Face to Face (1963), a critique of socialist society.",
