    "introduction": "TROUBLE IN THE PEACE is the story of a growing grassroots revolution against the multinational energy extraction industry. The film offers an unflinching look into the dark viscous world of Big Oil & Gas told through the personal perspective of two neighboring families at war over the land beneath their feet. When livestock begin dying and children become mysteriously ill after gas leaks, a series of bombs are set off on the pipelines in reaction. The gas company announces a 1 million dollar reward for the capture of the pipeline bomber, which viciously tears the community apart. But after the dust settles, the surprising and inspiring result is of people coming together with a common goal.",
