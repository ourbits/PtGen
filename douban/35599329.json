She spends most of her time at her best friend Laura’s house, whose mom prioritizes her romantic pursuits over her children’s well-being. When Laura’s young, handsome father Wayne re-enters her life, Carly’s bears witness to what a ‘good man’ is for the first time. Wayne is recently sober, keeps a nice home and seems to care for his daughter. Developing her newly discovered sexuality, Carly sets her sights on Wayne, eventually seducing him, sending their fragile lives into a permanent spiral.",
