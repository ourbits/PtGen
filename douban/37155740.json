Underwater, she is free and happy, removed from the hustle and bustle and noise of everyday life. Above water, however, it is not as simple for her to live independently. Slowly she builds her life anyway, together with her boyfriend - who looks suspiciously like Prince Erik in The Little Mermaid.",
