    "introduction": "Vic Morgenstein (formerly Vic Morgan) has been distributing gruesome Asian horror schlock and soft-core smut for years. His flagship video series, \"Drunk Chicks\" 1 through 6, consists entirely of inebriated young women exposing their breasts. These low rent titles have earned Vic a comfortable living, and a less-than savory reputation; everywhere he goes, young men recognize his face from the DVD cases and lift their shirts to him in salute. Vic was willing to accept his complete lack of respectability so long as the money kept rolling in. But that all changed when picked up a low budget, art-house movie called The Unreasonable Truth About Butterflies at a second rate film festival. Butterflies, directed by total unknown Rufus Marquez, went on to become something of darling on the indie festival circuit. Vic got hooked on respectability and came to realize his new dream: to produce and distribute \"respectable\" indie films. The only snag is Vic is bereft of things like taste and vision, so he enlists the help of seasoned IFC segment producer, Julia Sullivan. Together they will undertake the quest of producing their first indie-thriller, House of Fear, while Porn starlets, vapid PR execs, self-absorbed B-movie stars, eccentric Japanese investors, the American Beef lobby, and an unstable director create problems at every turn. Will Vic and Julia produce the film they dreamed of without compromising their integrity? Probably not, but the journey will be hilarious. Written by Phil Price & Myles Hainsworth",
