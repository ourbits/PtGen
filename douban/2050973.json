    "introduction": "Shocking as it may be – this movie shows a unique viewpoint of a boy/ young man- the storyline is full with possible answers to the question – why Jürgen committed the horrible crimes portrayed in the movie.I can hardly believe that someone will see this movie and fill find the guilt in the only boy himself – the parents and the surroundings of Jürgen played their role too to shape his mentality. \"…sad glimpses of the stunted boy inside the beast\" was written in what review – and that seems to me the most important point of the film – but I wonder if too many people will be able to see trough …\" The movie was disturbing indeed, especially since it is based on a true story. Some of the reviews I went trough about this movie were pointing out that the fact that Jürgen doesn't want to grow up is essential part of his \"ill mentality \" – and I strongly disagree with such opinion- what he did – those killings are evil , but they can not be associate with such desire of youthful life.",
