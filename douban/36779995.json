    "introduction": "Dust to Dust traces the inspiring journey of Japanese designer Yuima Nakazato, one of the few Japanese creators invited to the prestigious Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week. Known for his ethical commitment and innovative approach, Nakazato centers his collection INHERIT in this documentary, which was crafted from 150 kg of textiles salvaged from the world’s largest landfill, located in Kenya. The film takes viewers through the striking landscapes of Kenyan landfills, revealing the catastrophic environmental impact of the fast fashion industry. Dust to Dust highlights the urgency of rethinking our relationship with clothing while celebrating Nakazato’s revolutionary vision, where art and creativity blend with a profound ecological awareness.",
