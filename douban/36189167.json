    "introduction": "Dear Jonah is an exciting and hilarious special that presses comedy boundaries not often crossed. Generally, a comedian has their set practiced hundreds of times before a special taping, but in Dear Jonah, a rare, unplanned moment unfolds when T.J. befriends a heckling audience member, Jonah, who derails the planned set in a hilarious and charming way. T.J.’s interaction throughout the show with Jonah showcases T.J.’s improvisation skills and quick-on-his-feet comedy talent in 45 minutes of non-stop, unpredictable laughter.",
