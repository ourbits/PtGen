The film centers around the figure of a veteran filmmaker, with three other people circling around the pivotal character. While trying to finish his latest film, the director must cope with the losses in his life--a recently deceased father, and a wife who has left him--that have driven him to drink. But when a beautiful young filmmaker enters his life, he sees in her the chance to get his life and film back on track. DESERTED SEAS was directed byJos?Luis Garc Agraz, a critical and awards darling in Mexico.",
