    "introduction": "Far from the sophistication and relative tolerance of urban centers, gay people are beginning to lead integrated lives in small towns throughout rural America. Danny Cooper has been upfront about his homosexuality since his teens. Now he lives openly with his lover. As the local mailman in a small Louisiana town, he has come to be accepted in a friendly and courteous manner by his neighbors. Although Danny has been through fights in school, was once fired fromhis job, and even evicted from his home, he has never failed to stand up for his right to be himself. In the end, he is changing the face of anti-gay prejudice in his town. Today, Danny is fighting his hardest battle-against HIV infection-withthe same openness and courage. And even though his T-cell countis near zero, he describes himself as \"the luckiest human in the world.\"",
