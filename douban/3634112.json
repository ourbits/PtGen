    "introduction": "The Mischievous Teenager is a 1969 Romanian film directed by Gheorghe Vitanidis based on a screenplay written by prose writer Nicolae Breban . The main roles were played by the actors Irina Petrescu , Iurie Darie , Virgil Ogăşanu , Ioana Bulcă , Horea Popescu and Zizi Şerban .The film has the structure of a flashback , in which a proud doctor tells a younger doctor, who had cured him of a serious illness, a love story he lived with a nurse. This sentimental adventure briefly took him \"out of the world of conformity and conventional lies in which he indulges\" with distinction, \"and in which he returns, consistent with his principle that\" a superior man cannot love a woman of uncertain condition. \"This film was Romania's Oscar nomination for best foreign film in 1970, but did not enter the competition. He participated in the 6th edition of the Moscow International Film Festival , and Irina Petrescu won the Best Actress Award.",
