    "introduction": "Stela, a young Brazilian actress, decides to do a work on the letters exchanged between Latin American visual artists in the 70s and 80s. She travels to Cuba, Mexico, Argentina and Chile in search of her works and testimonies about the reality they lived during the dictatorships that most of these countries faced at the time. Amid the investigation, Stela discovers the existence of Ana, a young Brazilian woman who was part of this world, but disappeared. In 1968, Ana went from the south of Brazil, from a small country town, to the effervescent Buenos Aires, which was experiencing a moment of change in visual arts and behavior. Obsessed with the character, Stela decides to find her and find out what happened to her. The film is loosely inspired by the play There is more future than past.",
