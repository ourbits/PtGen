They loved each other very much, they were the perfect interpreters of one of those what we banally call fairy tales, but before the ‘happily ever after’ their world exploded, the sky turned upside down and the two of them found themselves far apart, scattered, full of anger, guilt and disappointment. Nicole is faced with a choice: meet her ex-husband again to get back something very important to her.",
