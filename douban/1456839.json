    "introduction": "THE CONCERT FOR GEORGE is currently playing in theatres. (This is being written in October, 2003.) I believe the DVD will include this version with other material, but, since that won't be out until November, I'm only commenting on what's being seen in movie theatres. This is a film of a memorial concert. George Harrison's colleagues and friends gathered at the Royal Albert Hall a years after his death and performed. The film quality is good and so is the sound. Everybody is relaxed. I've always felt THE CONCERT FOR BANGLADESH has an atmosphere of panic. THE CONCERT FOR GEORGE, with an equally stellar line-up, is much more assured than THE CONCERT FOR BANGLADESH. A highlight is a piece featuring Eric Clapton playing a guitar solo with Ravi Shankar's musicians behind him. The piece was written by Ravi Shankar for this event. George Harrison's concept of music which is both Western and Eastern is realized. Paul McCartney sings Harrison's \"All Things Must Pass\" clearly and sincerely. Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne sing \"Handle With Care,\" the Traveling Wilburys' signature tune. Billy Preston is in fine voice and someone I've never heard of, Joe Brown, performs. His band was managed by Brian Epstein. We are shown a poster for an event at which the Beatles warmed up for Joe Brown's group. Joe Brown's songs are sung in a warm, confident voice and he plays a ukelele. Ukeleles were a major joy for Harrison in his last decade. Ringo sings \"Photograph\" with better keyboard work than I've ever heard on it. He drums on a couple of the songs Paul sings on. McCartney and Clapton play a segmented \"Something,\" Paul beginning it with a ukelele and Clapton coming in about a third of the way through with a bright electric solo. The drumming at this point successfully duplicates the sound on ABBEY ROAD. Olivia Harrison lights a lamp at the beginning and, throughout the concert, Dhani Harrison plays rhythm guitar. He plays piano during the Ravi Shankar composition. During \"Isn't It a Pity,\" Dhani sings \"Nah, nah, nah, nah-nah, nah, nah\" in a tipping of the hat to \"Hey Jude.\" After \"Isn't It a Pity,\" Ringo introduces Paul. Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam (joined by Neil Innes and Tom Hanks, actually) do two skits and Palin makes two humorously pompous speeches. Several times, but not intrusively, the performers speak to the cameras about George. During one or two songs, the voice of an interviewee comes over a song, and that's my one objection. Altogether, this is a movie of a good concert and the last few minutes are really quite moving. I saw it with a small audience, but everybody clapped at the end.",
