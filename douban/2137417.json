    "introduction": "Frederick Ashton's delightful ballet had proved irresistible to audiences of all ages. The Royal Ballet's production had immediate appeal for newcomers to ballet at well as for those who return time and again to enjoy its lyrical comedy. It is a ballet set in the English countryside, telling how Lise manages to win the hand of the man she loves - the young farmer, Colas - despite her mother's determination to marry her off to the dim-witted son of a wealthy vineyard owner. This is one of the great masterpieces of The Royal Ballet's repertory, created by Frederick Ashton, set amid the witty designs of Osbert Lancaster, with Herold's delightful melodies to inspire the performances by some of the Company's leading artists.",
