    "introduction": "In a lonely seaside town, nothing ever seems to change, including the incumbent mayor of 30 years. One day, foreign investors appear touting changes in the name of progress. The mayor vehemently opposes the initiative. The capital cuts off their supplies and communications with the outside, leaving them hungry and alone. They resist. This is the tale of a village that refuses to disappear. This film was last shown at Cornerhouse on Wed 19 Sep 2007.",
