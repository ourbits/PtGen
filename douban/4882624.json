A suburban widow (LYNN COHEN) gets much more than she was looking for when she loses her license and leans on her neighbor (JAMES URBANIAK) for support.   And in the country, successful voice-over artist Bill Soap (HARRY CHASE) starts to make amends for being such a lousy father.   Sparkling with wit and humanity, Hello Lonesome is the first feature film from writer/director Adam Reid.",
