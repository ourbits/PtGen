    "introduction": "The island of Rab, early summer of 1992. Fero, a recently divorced 40-year old pathologist, returns to a small island town where he spent most of his childhood living with his widowed father. He is here for the funeral of a little girl called Mirna, the daughter of his friend, Globus. As it happens, weird stuff happens on this island off-season: apparently, there’s a huge lizard running about, Ranko, the village idiot, is accusing the monks of sawing little Mirna in half, and topping it all off, there’s the murder of Marillena AKA “the matchstick girl” - a Romanian trans woman, and a prostitute known as the culprit for the gonorrhoea cases around the island. In charge of the investigation is Mungos, the chief of police on the island, a Fero’s friend who draws Fero more and more into the investigation.源自：https://tickets.sff.ba/films/2214",
