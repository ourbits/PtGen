    "introduction": "The first time Sarah tries drugs is the first time she goes out with Tim, who was a customer of hers in the Dew Drop Inn Cafe. Tom is sweet and cool and after one night, she moves in with him; leaving behind her alcoholic mother and younger sister, Karen. For a while life is great and drugs are just part of the deal and most of the fun. But then things start getting complicated and she's not sure if she can handle it - there's one rave too many, a bad trip and she gets roughed up while doing a drop off for their dealer. Also, events at home mean that she cant block it out any longer: her mum needs her and Karen needs her. In turn, Sarah needs Tom, but will he - or can he- be there for Sarah? Written by Q",
