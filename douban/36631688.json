With a food fayre to die for, a real-life crime at a crime writing festival and a village rivalry that turns deadly, there’s plenty for the gang to be busy with. And when his old friend Sister Boniface is implicated in a murder at an arts and craft fair, Father Brown must prove her innocence – before it’s too late.",
