He strikes a friendship with a romantic potential with Jette, a rude, older German woman, who came to execute her great aunt's last will: scatter her ashes there, where she found love as post-war immigrant and left. The couple are already lovers when they discover Andri's single mother Freya is Jete's host, and finds it a nightmare that his son's heart would be broken be an outsider like his grandfather Haakon's by her kin.",
