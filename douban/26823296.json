    "introduction": "THE DARKEST UNIVERSE is BAFTA-nominated directors Will Sharpe and Tom Kingsley's surreal and hilarious follow-up to the critically acclaimed BLACK POND. Described by Sharpe and Kingsley as 'a romantic comedy set in space, or - to be more specific - planet Earth', the film follows world-weary banker Zac on his search for his eccentric sister, Alice, who goes missing while on a narrowboat trip with her new boyfriend. Poignant, funny and thought-provoking in equal measure, The Darkest Universe is an otherworldly and truly original gem of a movie from two of the UK's freshest young directors. the film's ensemble cast includes Joe Thomas and Simon Bird (THE INBETWEENERS) and an array of Britain's brightest comic talents.",
