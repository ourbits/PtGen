The story of Milarepa is structured in three parts: that of black magic (the protagonist, encouraged by his mother, learns the art of killing), that of white magic (a journey towards perfection thanks to the harsh teachings of Milarepa’s master, Marpa) and that of transfiguration (the achievement of absolute detachment from the material reality).",
