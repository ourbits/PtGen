    "introduction": "First performed in 1781 in Munich, Idomeneo is known as Mozart's first \"great\" opera, which launched Mozart (although only aged 25) as a mature composer on the opera scene. It tells the story from Greek mythology about the Cretan King Idomeneo, who has to decide between the life of his son and the welfare of his people. \"What's Idomeneo about? It's about people, who return home after a long, horrible war which we still talk about today, and continue to carry the weight of events on their shoulders. They have baggage, so to speak, which they are unable to get rid of.\" (Kasper Holten)CAST 16.02.2019Conductor-Tomáš NetopilDirector-Kasper HoltenStage Design-Mia StensgaardCostume Design-Anja Vang KraghLighting Design-Jesper KongshaugMovement director-Signe FabriciusDramaturge-Adrian MourbyIdomeneo-Bernard RichterIdamante-Rachel FrenkelElettra-Irina LunguIlia-Valentina Naforniţă",
