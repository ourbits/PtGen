    "introduction": "Loved it. Fantastic acting, incredibly well directed, great script and great music. It had the rare ability to combine humor and rawness. And, in fact, the director was able to bring you to the edge time and time again and then pull you back.We actually went to the theater to see something else, ended up seeing this and we both loved it. Saw it here in Buenos Aires and it was very authentic in tone, context and, in many ways (though obviously dramatized) the reality of what so many people are dealing with day to day.The characters seemed to leap right off the city streets. This is the kind of film that Hollywood can never produce, and US independent film usually bungles with excessive violence or trite plots in an attempt to have a commercial hook, or the acting just doesn't come up to this level. I hope the film gets seen widely!",
