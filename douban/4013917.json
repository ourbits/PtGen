    "introduction": "TULAD NG DATI follows the current exploits of the Filipino rock band, The Dawn, composed of Teddy Diaz, JB Leonor, Caloy Balcells and Jett Pangan. During the second half of the 1980s, the band had risen to become the most influential musical rock group of the time. At the height of their popularity, their leader, Teddy Diaz is murdered. The remaining members decide to continue on with the music but eventually disband in 1996. In 2003, The Dawn reunited. Tulad ng Dati starts in 2006. It revolves around the character of Jett Pangan who is nearing his forties. Jett has lost his passion for music and life and entertains thoughts of retiring from the band. On a fateful night, Jett is assaulted by a burglar and goes into a coma. He wakes up with no memory of his life after 1988. He remembers that he is 20 years old and is at the peak of his career with The Dawn. Not satisfied with how things turned out with his life, he tries to change everything back to the way it used to be. The path he takes while finding his place in this strange new world proves itself to be a tough, emotional, and sometimes hilarious journey-accompanied by the celebrated music of The Dawn, both past and present.",
