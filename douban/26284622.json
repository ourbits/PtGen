    "introduction": "Young and attractive company executive Hanna von Stezewitz (Amira Casar) has everything, andjust takes whatever she doesn’t. She’s an arrogant and unscrupulous manipulator who has politiciansand banks in her pocket – she’s a perfect example of predatory capitalism whose preferred sartoriallook is patent leather and leather. To avoid boredom she seeks ever more extreme kicks and seesher abuse of a young girl with hopes of a career merely as collateral damage, nothing money can’tfix. The only person who stands in her way is her bedridden grandfather, the family patriarch, and hisreactionary worldview. Desperate to be rid of him, she hires a killer. When Hanna unexpectedly findsa lover who is her equal in the shape of Sarah, the nun who is her grandfather’s nurse, her happinessseems complete. But does she really have everything under control? Peter Kern has succeededin creating an angry, opulent portrait of manners in which everyone – rich or poor – is corruptibleor at least susceptible to seduction, and criminality and capital go hand in glove. A merry dance ofcorruption in which anyone who steps out of time is simply brushed aside.",
