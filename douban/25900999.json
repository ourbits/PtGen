    "introduction": "Teenager Luka lives in the small Serbian town of Mladenovac with a mother who can’t handle him anymore, and his life is one scrape after another. He and his mate Flash lead the local football fans and spend most of their spare time rooting for their team and drinking beer. Through the destiny of one individual, Ivan Ikić presents a laconic, highly authentic account of the young Serbian generation who, in his words, are “growing up in a society of lost values, where corruption, immorality, crime and abuse of power only prosper.”",
