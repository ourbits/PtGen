    "introduction": "The fifteenth season of Saturday Night Live, an American sketch comedy series, originally aired in the United States on NBC between September 30, 1989, and May 19, 1990.Very few changes were made before and during the season. Ben Stiller, after appearing in four episodes of Season 14, had left due to creative differences with Lorne Michaels. Mike Myers was upgraded to repertory status.This season saw the first hosting gigs of three celebrities who would go on to be frequent SNL hosts: John Goodman (who auditioned to be a castmember on SNL during the 1980-1981 season and frequently cameoed on SNL in the mid-1990s as Linda Tripp), Christopher Walken (whose sketch \"The Continental\" had been a staple in six of the seven episodes hosted by Walken), and Alec Baldwin (who went on to break John Goodman's hosting record in 2006 and, as of October 2011,[dated info] surpassed Steve Martin as the most frequent SNL host).The episode hosted by Andrew Dice Clay was boycotted by Nora Dunn, due to Clay's profane jokes about women. The original musical guest for the episode, Sinéad O'Connor, joined Dunn in her boycott, and was replaced by Julee Cruise and The Spanic Boys.A live special commemorating the fifteen seasons of SNL was aired September 24, 1989, before the start of the season.This was the final season for Dunn and Jon Lovitz.",
