    "introduction": "This documentary mini-series offers exclusive access to the major players of Yakuza organizations, both past and present. Born in the dregs of Japanese society, the Yakuzas have managed to rise up to the country's highest ranks. They exercise a grip on the whole of Japan, from civil society to politics, and even beyond its borders. The Japanese authorities, under pressure from the United States, which felt threatened, had no choice but to enact a series of anti-gang laws. Today it is more and more difficult for a Yakuza to exist out in the open, but they have recently made attempts to return to the public stage.PRODUCED BY Imagissime",
