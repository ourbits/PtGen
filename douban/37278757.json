    "introduction": "This is the story of one of the most important contemporary artists on the planet. A young man who explored art until he connected with the Carrara quarry, where he experimented with the material that would change his career forever: marble. The fusion between the artist and this stone has given birth to some of the most striking and valuable sculptures in the world. A simple being, with a story of ascent and a unique global relevance. This journey takes us through his life between Italy and his foundation in Punta del Este, Uruguay. An intimate look into the artist's world, the monumental process of creating one of his works, and his connection with the elite of the global art scene.",
