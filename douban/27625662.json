    "introduction": "It is a story of the eminent Polish painter, Zdzisław Beksiński and his complicated relations with his son Tomasz. Beksinski’s parenthood was not easy, since his son, a popular music journalist, suffered from depression and ventured several suicide attempts. It is a shocking documentary drama that has been precisely reconstructed on the basis of never published materials. Numerous audio recordings, videos and photos taken from the archives of Beksiński family have been incorporated into the film. The scenario is based on the bestselling biography of Magdalena Grzebałkowska entitled “The Beksinskis. Double Portrait” published in 2014.",
