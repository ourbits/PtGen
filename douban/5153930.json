In an old mill one grain of wheat and one grain of corn are dancing their first and last dance. Like the little prince and little princess they experience their . timeless love and end up grounded along with thousands of other grains. But this is not a tragic story! In eternal contin¬uation of life, wheat and corn are turned into the precious flour.A relatively new (1995) film, it was written by Oscar-winner Dusan Vukotic. In live action, an old man feeds a flower mill. Two seeds are then transferred into animated lovers who dance their last waltz.",
