His slacker roommates seem to always need his help: Chad, the wannabe entrepreneur; Veronica, the self-centered princess; and Chlora, the hapless Hollywood dreamer. Jeff does his best to keep a roof over their heads, oblivious to the zombie hordes, nuclear explosions, and other disasters along the way. At least he can count on Walter, the macho militiaman who's been preparing for Armageddon for years, and Synthia, the beautiful android whose mission is to protect Jeff and save humanity in the process.",
