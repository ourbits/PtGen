    "introduction": "A drama about the effects of Hindu fundamentalism on a small Bengali village, as seen through the eyes of two friends. Nemai (Tapas Pal) and Balaram (Shankar Chakraborty) have been friends for years. When not working at a rural railroad crossing, they wrestle one another. Among the few visitors to their area is a troupe of singers and a busload of dwarves led by a man in a railway uniform. The peaceful life led by the area's occupants is also exemplified by a local preacher (R.I. Asad) and his adopted son Matthew (Saurav Das), who feed the poor. The tranquil fabric of everyday existence is brutally torn when a trio of Hindu militants arrive, burning down the church, killing the padre, and exacting horrific violence against any who get in their way. In the midst of all of the chaos that surrounds them, Nemai and Balaram keep wrestling.",
