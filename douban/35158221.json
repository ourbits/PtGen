    "introduction": "There are 60,000 motorcycle taxi drivers in Liberia… and only 10 of them are women. They call themselves the Pink Panthers All-Girls Motorcycle Club of Liberia. 'Pink Panther' tells KD’s story of life as a woman motorcyclist in a country and sector still dominated by men. The film looks at the successes and failures of international aid efforts to help women break into the motorcycle business. It explores the multiple and contradictory ways that gender identity and gender norms play out in post-war Liberia. KD’s love of riding and pride at being one of the first women to make it as a cyclist shine through but might not be enough to keep her in the motorbike hustle.",
