The Art of Architecture finds out how art influences the great designers of our time, from Santiago Calatrava to Sir David Adjaye. Along the way, the series has privileged access to projects as diverse as Battersea Power Station, the new V & A in Dundee, a distillery in Speyside, the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, London’s re-vamped Design Museum and The Vessel – not a building but a grand staircase that is sure to become a new icon of Manhattan. © Abacus Media RightsFEATURED STRUCTURE & ARCHITECT:S1 E1 - World Trade Center Transportation HubS1 E2 - Battersea Power Station redevelopmentS1 E3 - V&A DundeeS1 E4 - VesselS1 E5 - Weston Tower, Westminster AbbeyS1 E6 - Macallan DistilleryS1 E7 - Smithsonian National Museum of African American HistoryS1 E8 - Design Museum, KensingtonS1 E9 - John Simpson's houseS1 E10 - Alexandra Palace theatre restorationPRODUCED BY Colonial PicturesDIRECTOR & PRODUCER: Alastair Layzell",
