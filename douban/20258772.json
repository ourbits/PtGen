The only trouble is, Jack's parents don't know that he's married (courtesy of a drunken binge in Las Vegas). With his mother going all out to impress with her newly acquired knowledge of Judaism, Jack's intention of keeping his marriage a secret soon hangs in the balance when a trip to the local, Swayze's, threatens to bring proceedings to a head.",
