    "introduction": "Documentary film about artists from the Sinti and Roma minority, whose works often address the painful experience of persecution in the 20th century. The film provides illuminating insights into a highly creative and lively art scene and contrasts this with the hostile clichés to which Sinti and Roma were and are often exposed, especially in art. The attentive production emphatically raises awareness for their often marginalised art and shows the creative act of the artists as a permanent act of revolt.",
