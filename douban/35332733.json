    "introduction": "How long can you stay frustrated over a lost war? This is what you wonder when you see Marcelo Wytrykusz, an Argentinian veteran of the Malvinas War—better known elsewhere as the Falklands War. Forty years on, he still hasn’t resigned himself to Argentina’s defeat by the United Kingdom.He comes across as sensible, a well-intentioned father and a husband who leaves little to complain about. But he’s stuck with an obsessive plan: to refurbish his old pleasure yacht and sail across to one of the islands to plant the Argentinian flag.For the family, it’s not always easy to cope with Wytrykusz’s compulsion for revenge. Some of his former comrades in arms say he’s crazy. But the veteran is blinded by his mission to right the wrongs of the past — against his better judgment, and despite his deteriorating health and the changes that have since taken place in international relations.源自：https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/98f4d301-dcf5-48ff-b560-a49e2eb1d593/port-desire",
