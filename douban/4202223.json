    "introduction": "The eighteenth century, swashbuckling adventures of Britain's legendary highwayman. When he returned from military service in Flanders, Dick Turpin discovered he had been cheated out of his inheritance by an unscrupulous landowner. Bitter and penniless, Turpin took to the open road as a highwayman. Possessed of a decided Robin Hood complex, he spent much of his time meddling in other peoples' troubles. His partner on the road was young Nick Smith (\"Swiftnick\"), and his perpetual enemy was villainous Sir John Glutton.Dick Turpin and his jolly companion Swiftnick are highway robbers in 18th century England. A nuisance to the noblemen and the rich, bleeding hearts towards the poor, and with lots of romance towards the other gender, they often find themselves in deep trouble.This series, very loosely based on the adventures of the real highwayman Dick Turpin, ran on the British TV station ITV between 1979 and 1982.",
