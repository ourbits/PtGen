    "introduction": "In September 1993, the Oslo Accords were signed. Rabin and Arafat shook hands with Bill Clinton, and peace seemed possible. At a time when the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is back in the spotlight, when the hope of Oslo seems so distant, we offer an original portrait of the man who, in the eyes of history, embodies the Palestinian cause.The life of Yasser Arafat is a story worthy of a spy novel. A legend in his own right, the Palestinian leader has become one of the most enigmatic figures of the century, a tangle of rumour and truth. Terrorist and Nobel Peace Prize winner, idealist and professional liar, the \"Che Guevara of the East\" remains an enigma today.In an increasingly explosive international context, where violent confrontations between Israelis and Palestinians continue to occur, it seems important to re-examine this emblematic figure. Through him, we decipher the infernal cycles of violence that still tear apart this \"land for two peoples\". This 100% archival series tells the story of one of the key figures of the 20th century.Production : CC&C, ORFBroadcasters : Planète+, ORF, Radio CanadaProducer : Diane Imbault-Huart",
