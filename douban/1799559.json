He returns home and gets pulled into a TV commercial for a K-Tel style album whose songs outline job search techniques, like You Gotta Have a Plan. He goes on an interview: after passing through a waiting room full of big scary characters, he is rejected immediately. For his next interview, he gets more aggressive too much so. For his last interview, he comes in as a one-man-band and is immediately ejected. He finds himself confronted by scary street characters who mock him for not having a job and awakens to the end of the commercial, and a ringing telephone.",
