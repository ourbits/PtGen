He adds one line to the clips: \"I want to tell my story on your show.\" Face to face with the current poster boy for evil, Lax must use every tool at his disposal to get an answer to the question everyone's been asking, but no one has been able to find: Why? Lax, haunted by what he did to acquire fame, has to now make an important decision.",
