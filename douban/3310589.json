    "introduction": "黑白纪录片关于60年代初的巴西总统Joao Belchior Marques Goulart，别名“杨戈”，1964年他领导的左翼民主政府被右翼发动的军事政变而取代，从此巴西开始了十几年的独裁专政时期。The film depicts the life and career of Joao Belchior Marques Goulart, known as \"Jango\", a leader of the Labor Party which eventually (and accidentally) became President of Brazil. Distrusted by the conservative wings and underestimated by the left, Jango defied both sides by presenting a plan for structural reforms in the nation's major problems. His intentions, however, were halted by a military coup, which found no resistance at all, and threw Brazilians into a 20 years dictatorship. This documentary tries to debate how naif President Jango was and how the right-wing managed to win so easily.",
