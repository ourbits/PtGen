    "introduction": "As the sun beams brightly on the hills surrounding Palestine, one young shepherd boy thoughtfully considers the significance of the day. The child, crippled in a terrible accident, has always treasured his shepherd father's tale of that starlit night so many years before - a night filled with the wonder of angelic heralds and a tiny Bethlehem stable sheltering the chosen Messiah. Now, years since that sacred event, tales of Jesus of Nazareth's miraculous birth touch the young boy's faith. When he meets the gentle stranger in the hills - a man strangely familiar to him - the faithful young shepherd encounters a miracle of his own.",
