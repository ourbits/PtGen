    "introduction": "The emergence of the Coronavirus disease in late 2019 and its rapid spread throughout the world in 2020 made an indelible impact upon countless lives, transforming so many in a multitude of ways. This profoundly personal narrative details the efforts of a documentary filmmaker to portray the lives of six characters in quarantine and how it affects them. There is also the filmmaker’s own personal situation – he cannot go to his wife because of the curfew imposed by the government. Through this, he finds common ground with his subjects.源自：https://www.sheffdocfest.com/film/narratives-ad-hominem",
