    "introduction": "Screen adaptation of the satirical novel by Andrei Mry (Shashalevich).The main character is the head of the cultural department of the district executive committee, Samson Samosui, whose lack of competence is compensated by his extraordinary activity in the field of cultural organization. Samosui organizes absurd cultural events, trying to “raise the level of culture” in the area as soon as possible, while at the same time trying to improve his personal life at all costs. After the discovery of “troglodytes” in the area of the village and a scandalous theatrical performance, the incompetent Samosui is promoted and transferred to the district cultural department.Soviet criticism branded “Notes” as “a malicious libel on Soviet reality.”The entire novel was published only in 1988 in Polymya, No. 1; and soon after that it was filmed in 1990.",
