    "introduction": "It's 1866 and twelve year old Harry has lived and breathed magic since his early childhood. The problem is that his hometown, Appletown, is not the best place for his natural talent to blossom. Although he rehearses endlessly in his parent's barn he realizes that his dream is just that - a dream. One day Harry catches the glimpse of a chance when the mayor of New York announces a magic competition to celebrate the official opening of the Statue of Liberty. But there's a catch - to enter the competition one must be trained by a real magician and poor Harry doesn't know a single one. But then, Harry's father crosses path with the Great Tesla, a true magician! Tesla promises to meet Harry and despite the young boy's lack of knowledge, Tesla sees talent, creativity, and boldness in Harry. He decides to give him a chance and invites him to his home to begin training. Accompanied by his niece, Beth, and his assistant, Amrold, Tesla will teach Harry the basics of magic and his tricks. He will also test him. Will Harry be strong enough to become a true magician?",
