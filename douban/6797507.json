Today 38 years after the war, Meher has a visitor she cannot turn down. Sarah-a 'war-child,' Meher's cousin Neela's daughter, who was given away for adoption has come back to piece together her past. Together, these two women must re-tell history through their stories in order to cut through the stigmas and walk into light. Written by Rubaiyat Hossain",
