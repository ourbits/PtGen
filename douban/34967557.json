    "introduction": "The music video for \"Ashes to Ashes\" was one of the most iconic of the 1980s. With production costing £250,000 ($500,000), it was at the time the most expensive music video ever made and remains one of the most expensive of all time. It incorporated scenes both in solarised color and in stark black-and-white and was filmed in multiple locations. The video featured Bowie in the gaudy Pierrot costume that became the dominant visual representation of his Scary Monsters phase. Also appearing were Steve Strange and other members of the London Blitz scene, including Judith Frankland who had designed clothes for Strange's Visage videos and Darla Jane Gilroy, forerunners of the New Romantic movement that was heavily influenced by Bowie's music and image. The complexity and high production cost of \"Ashes to Ashes\" makes it one of the most significant in the evolution of the music video.",
