    "introduction": "波兰女导演荷兰徳早年的“女性三部曲”的第一部，也是她独立执导的长片处女作，尽管她后来的作品如《欧洲，欧洲》《华盛顿广场》等已经不再是女性主义了，但她早期的三部影片《地方演员》（1978）《孤独的女人》（1980）和《狂热》（1981）才是最能体现她作为一个女性导演的个人风格的作品。与同时代德国女导演M-冯-特罗塔的《德国姐妹》一样，这部影片的女主角Halina Labonarska的表演也非常出色，获得波兰国家电影节最佳女演员奖，以及1980年嘎纳影展的影评人费比西奖。\nThe film is set in a small town near Warsaw, to which a young and coming director comes to produce a classic play (Wyspianski \"Wyzwolenie\") with a modern vein. Everyone in the production gets his usual stereotypical role, but the aging idol of the ensemble senses opportunity to give the performance of his life. For young director everything is already set. The leading man, however, is not giving up and is trying to restore the role according to his view. His wife listens to his fears, complaints and frustrations, while resigning herself to a fading career in a puppet theatre.\nTalented Polish female director Agnieszka Holland who would be better known in later years because of her films like Europa, Europa (1991) or some of her American works like Washington Square (1997), hits the mark early and again with this ostensible story about provincial actors in Poland. In reality, the comedy-drama can be read as a commentary on the contemporary Polish scene in politics and society. The story begins as a savvy director arrives in a small town to put on a stage play. His leading man is filled with insecurities and goes beyond the confines of his lead role to expand his part, restore his cut lines, and generally outdo himself while taking on some of everyone else's job, including the director's. No one wants to lose him because of his drawing power, and the director is caught in a bind. At the same time, the lead actor's wife is slowly losing her chances at success, being relegated to a much lesser position in the troupe. This fine comedy won the Fipresci award at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival.",
