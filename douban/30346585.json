    "introduction": "Professor Brian Cox is going in search of the best of British science. Introducing his science heroes, Brian visits the places where they made their discoveries, recreating their experiments, and examining their legacy to their scientific descendants. He finds that this tradition of innovation and discovery owes everything to the early pioneers—but he also exposes the often surprising themes that define modern science: how the business of discovery and innovation is a process of creative inspiration, collaboration, and true grit. Brian finds out what science is, where science came from, and where science may be taking us.A BBC Production. 3-part series, 50 minutes each.S1 E1 Frankenstein's MonstersS1 E2 Method and MadnessS1 E3 Clear Blue Skies",
