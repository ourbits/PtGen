    "introduction": "In Diciannove (translating to Nineteen), Giovanni Tortorici’s elegant, heartfelt, and daring debut, a curious student learns that the road to self-discovery is worthwhile, if not necessary, no matter how unfamiliar or daunting the path.Eager to escape his overbearing mother and the only life he’s known, 19-year-old Leonardo (Manfredi Marini, who gives an exceptional performance), leaves picturesque Palermo to study in bustling London. His landing is buffered by his sister Arianna (Vittoria Planeta) and her roommate Grazia (Dana Giuliano), though the initial excitement of living abroad — and unrestricted partying — wanes quickly, and Leonardo finds himself enrolling at the University of Siena, focusing on Italian literature.Back in familiar surroundings, he falls in love with the medieval city, but is not so keen on his literature professor. Seeking that indescribable feeling of knowing you’ve found your place — beyond just geography — Leonardo delves into the classics independently, spawning a soul-searching and deep interest in early modern authors like Pulci, Segneri, and Leopardi. Surrounding himself with beauty, vibrant youth, and new ideas — as well as images he’d previously repressed — his world blooms. A year into his unbound journey, Leonardo travels to Torino where he meets a man who, though much older, may finally be a contemporary — if not the key to unlocking his innermost desires.",
