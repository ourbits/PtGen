That lends an air of inauthenticity to the story he tells his wife in the morning about what happened at two A.M. It seems the blonde in 3-D needed him to play Sir Galahad. At two A.M., she has a man in her apartment. And he's dead. \"Miss Elliot, I can't get involved in a murder,\" says Harry. \"I'm a married man.\" But it isn't long before he finds himself helping her take the corpse down to the basement. Was the whole thing a dream?",
