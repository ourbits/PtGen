    "introduction": "On the sixth day, God created Adam and from his rib crafted Eve. Adam was endowed with the ability to emulate the divine, symbolizing power. But what about Eve? Beyond her roles in procreation, love, and compassion, she is seldom the center of attention. What else does she embody...?Over the past decade, the global proportion of people living alone has increased to 33%, with the fastest growth occurring in China, India, and Brazil.According to statistics from the Chinese Ministry of Civil Affairs, in 2021, the number of Chinese adults living alone approached 100 million, with 42.1% being women, which is nearly 42 million people.",
