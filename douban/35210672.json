    "introduction": "Choi Mun-seon (Seong So-min), a painter who lives alone on a beach, rescues drowning In-sun (Kim Ui-hyang). In-sun, a stewardess from Seoul, has more than platonic feelings for him, but he has no special feelings for her.Mun-seon meets Yun Myeong-hee who lived in his neighborhood 15 years ago. In order to help Myeong-hee's brother, Myeong-geun (Hyeon Sang-seob), who works for a magazine company, Mun-seon goes to Seoul. Myeong-hee and Mun-seon fall in love with each other. When In-sun meets Mun-seon in Seoul, she confesses her love for him, but he turns it down in a roundabout way. Meanwhile, Hwang In-su (Choi Bong), Mun-seon's co-worker at the company, teases Myoeng-hee and In-sun, while his wife (Kim Sin-jae) has been bedridden for years. On Myeonghee's and Mun-seon's engagement day, In-sun calls Mun-seon, saying that she has something to tell him. Before he arrives, In-su stabs In-sun to death because she turns him down. In-su blinds Mun-seon with a knife and he faints. Before In-su runs away, he puts his knife in Mun-seon's hand. Blind and stigmatized, Mun-seon accepts his fate and gives up defending himself. In the end, In-su is so touched by Mun-seon's personality that he confesses his crime. Freed, Mun-seon gets on a train to his hometown without letting Myeong-hee know.",
