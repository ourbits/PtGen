Whilst filming, on the 11th July 2001, a 16mm film canister was confiscated from Alex Monteith in Strabane by the then Royal Ulster Constabulary (now Police Service of Northern Ireland) – this artwork is the video re-authored by the RUC from the 16mm footage.源自：https://bfmaf.org/programme/for-gods-sake-bring-me-a-large-scotch-what-a-bloody-awful-country-reginald-maudling-secretary-of-state-for-northern-ireland-1970-72/",
