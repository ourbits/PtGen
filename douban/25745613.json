    "introduction": "Former festival director Kim Dong-ho always mentioned that he wanted to make a film when he left his chair. After he stepped down from his festival director position that he was dedicated to for fifteen years, he started to make his first short Jury. In Ongoing Smile his long time friend Mohsen Makhmalbaf followed his trail as he goes down the road to his directorial debut. Often called endearing, there are three well-known things about Kim Dong-ho; the enormous amount of booze he can drink; his regular life routine and ongoing smile on his face. At five o’clock every morning, he gets up from the bed and starts a day with newspapers. He exercises, works, meets old friends, and makes a film. He started his career as a government official and had a busy life as he transformed from a festival director to a film director, but his life never really changes. Makhmalbaf, with friendly gaze, brings Mr. Kim’s past and present into his daily life and ongoing smiles. (CHO Young-jung)",
