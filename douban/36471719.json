    "introduction": "In-cheol succumbs to the temptation of black money and steals a scientific thesis, but he gets caught in the process and is accidentally covered in chemicals, which make him invisible. He helps his lover, Mi-ok, and his friends in need, but increasingly becomes pessimistic about his own situation, as he can’t get back to normal. Meanwhile, when Mi-ok is kidnapped, he seeks out the scientist who made him invisible and gives him an ultimatum.Within the lineage of South Korean science fiction films, the story of the invisible man holds a significant place. There were early works, such as The End of an Invisible Man (1960) and Invisible Man (1969), followed by the more recent Invisible Man (1986). Unlike the previous films, which unfortunately have been lost and cannot be viewed, this version provides various opportunities for interpretation, allowing us to ruminate on the circumstances of its production at the time.
