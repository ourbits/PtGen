    "introduction": "Conflicted by his mother's new relationship and his best friend's crush on him, Bruno, a pyromaniac teenager, escapes from the city. He sets off on a journey in search of a girl he met online who will push him to confront his father's death and the doubts about his sexuality, but not before leaving all his fires behind.Director's Note:Fire will attract more attention than any other cry for help. It represents carnality and desire. Bruno represses these instincts, and they manifest through pyromania. This is a transformation journey where fire is a metaphor for change.源自：https://www.locarnofestival.ch/festival/program/film.html?fid=a8f0528b-7e89-4751-9a10-46615171988f",
