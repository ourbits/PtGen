    "introduction": "Plot Summary for\"The Huckleberry Hound Show\" (1958)Huckleberry Hound is a blue-haired Southern dog with a fondness for the song, \"My Darling, Clementine\", and is a jack-of-all-trades cartoon star, appearing as a scientist (trying to neutralize a gigantic, thinking potato), a Scotland Yard detective (chasing Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in Victorian London or investigating reports of a mad scientist's Frankenstein-like weiner monster in early-1900s rural England), a Foreign Legion soldier (foiling a renegade Frenchman-turned-Arab), or a modern policeman (trying to subdue an impish ape named Wee Willie). Episodes of this television series begin and end with a Huckleberry cartoon. Sandwiched between them is a cartoon with two mischievous mice, Pixie and Dixie and a cantankerous cat named Mr. Jinks. Sometimes appearing in their stead in the middle cartoon was a free-spirited Hokey Wolf or the \"smarter than the average\" Yogi Bear.Summary written by Kevin McCorry {mmccorry@nb.sympatico.ca}http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051283/plotsummary",
