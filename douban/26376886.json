Doug's in the remote woods for a routine episode, until he's awoken by an earth-shaking crash. Things get weirder as it becomes clear Doug isn't alone. Someone of something is watching him. MAN VS is a gripping 'found footage' thriller about one man's extraordinary desire to survive at all costs.",
