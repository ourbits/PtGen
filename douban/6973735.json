But when his family's dance studio is in danger of falling into the hands of his arch enemy, the cocky religious zealot Diego, he's got to compete against the big boys in high-stakes competition. To do that, he'll need the help of his coach Sam, a disgraced former dancing legend, and his partner, the sweet but high strung Helena, who's bitter at Tony for his tragic dance lesson with her grandma.",
