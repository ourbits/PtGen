In sheer lethargy they are planning to go to a film festival organized by Emir Kusturica, famous film director. In a Belgrade restaurant they run into Zoran Cvijanovic Cviya, their friend and colleague who happens to be going to the festival himself. In only two January days Milena and Masha will be faced with various challenges, hopes and fears. Two young actresses are, by all means, trying to get the attention of famous film director (Emir Kusturica), meeting local and world famous stars such as Gael Garcia Bernal along the way only to prove that all dreams can come true. All play themselves.",
