    "introduction": "Dylan Akio Smith and Kris Elgstrand’s slyly funny, absurdist Doppelganger Paul is a comedy about alienation, plagiarism and identity in an increasingly fragmented world. The hero, a fiercely lonely, would be writer named Paul (Tygh Runyan), is convinced that Karl (Brad Dryborough), the last man he saw before a near death experience, is his doppelganger --even though they could hardly be more dissimilar.  Although it’s never explicitly asked, Doppelganger Paul constantly poses the question: in a fragmented world, is any sense of belonging so valuable we’ll give up anything to hold on to it?",
