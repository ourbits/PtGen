Series 1-2 were narrated by Dean Lennox Kelly. From series 3 onwards it is narrated by Steven Jackson.The show highlights ways in which people can be swayed, systems fooled and goods or money stolen using simple psychology (and the occasional assistance of gadgets or fake props), with a view to educating the viewer in how to avoid becoming a victim. Terminology from the world of the scam artist is employed and explained, and the marks are fully informed of the cons/scams straight afterwards and repaid any money they'd lost. The show is a spin-off documentary of the BBC drama series Hustle.",
