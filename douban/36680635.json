    "introduction": "This season visited two continents and eight countries. Starting in Puerto Vallarta, racers traveled through Mexico, Colombia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Barbados, and the Dominican Republic before finishing in Philadelphia.Filming for this season began on October 25, 2022, in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Though this season will be the 36th to air, it was the 35th to be filmed, with the 35th aired season being filmed in mid-2023. This change to postpone the season was made following the decision to air 90-minute episodes as a result of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike rather than re-edit the episodes for an additional 30 minutes.Much like the 33rd and 34th seasons, teams traveled by chartered plane. A Global Crossing Airlines Airbus 320 was used to transport teams and production crew between locations while reducing personal interactions associated with COVID-19 infections. This season also included first-time visits to Barbados and the Dominican Republic. Filming concluded in Philadelphia on November 17, 2022.",
