    "introduction": "Seven years after Rhythmus 59, codirected with Markus Zizenbacher (Go West, Austrian Competition 2023), Aleksey Lapin—whose feature-length debut Krai (2021) made quite a splash—returns to Vienna Shorts with this elegant enigma that unfolds in one virtuoso take. An innocuous chat between young siblings hanging out at a city-center market gradually takes on supernatural and even apocalyptic overtones. The intensity stealthily builds all the way up to a genuinely sublime finale.",
