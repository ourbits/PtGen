An opportunistic entrepreneur (Hayden Kho) develops a bond with a street kid (John Manalo) trying to help him get to his business meeting in Makati, after losing his cellphone to a snatcher. A teacher (Sue Prado) from the province haggles with a former OFW, turned taxi driver (Allen Dizon), whether the country should follow world standards in basic education requirements. And a snatcher (Aljur Abrenica) trying to reform himself with the help of a nurse (Kris Bernal) by trying to return what he stole. Three stories all asking the same thing: what matters most, the collective or the individual gain?",
