    "introduction": "In a series of cabaret pieces, Steffen Mensching and Hans-Eckardt Wenzel – highly acclaimed East German poets, songwriters and comedians – satirize East German life in the historic year after the Wall came down. The two clowns they play, Meh and Weh, are allowed to leave prison to sing for people outside. As they perform their pieces, however, the country sinks into rebellion, the prison is attacked and looted, and the people chase the clowns away. The title is a wordplay on the irreverent Dada art movement of the 1920s and the German acronym for East Germany",
