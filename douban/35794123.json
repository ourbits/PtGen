A mother, a grandmother, a Member of Parliament, television work, a career, a strong woman in a man’s world. An upbeat attitude towards life, striving for good, believing in good. A powerful Finnish woman – Kyllikki Virolainen. Keys to the Good Life is a portrait of a Finnish influencer, which is shaped by her opinions and personal views on good life. The 15-minute monologue of the worldview of Kyllikki Virolainen is a satirical documentary and a sharp portrait.",
