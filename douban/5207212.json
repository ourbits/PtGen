    "introduction": "This touching investigation of innocent childhood love is set against the background of traditional Senegalese class system. Despite the difference in their upbringing and family lives, five young children become friends. Omar is in love with Yacine, a pretty, intelligent girl from a wealthy family. He decides to pen her a love letter, which ends up causing misunderstanding and a rift between him and his childhood love. Meanwhile, Demba falls in love with a beggar and they share 'secret' stares and tender touches in brief meetings each time. All the children seek advice from their mentor, who sells bicycle-rides at the beach-front. The innocence of childhood infatuation is cleverly layered over a troubled Senegal labouring under the strains of strike action and economic upheaval.",
