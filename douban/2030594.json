    "introduction": "\"The Brak Show is a story of a neighborhood. It's the story of a family. It's the story of what happens when adults have children and those children go to school. And Brak is in it. He lives in a house. A house on a quiet street not unlike yours or mine. A house in a neighborhood. That's The Brak Show.\" So goes Cartoon network's description of the new sitcom starring Brak, the absent-minded space pirate from the Space Ghost cartoons. He goes through the all the typical sitcom situations with his friend Zorak. Also along for the ride are Brak's parents, his brother Sisto, and his next-door neighbor Thundercleese.
