    "introduction": "The series is a collection of morality tales which also has insinuations of a horror story; gruesome punishments happen throughout. The stories mainly focus on naughty or horrible children(for example those that are vain, untidy, lazy, or lying) learning a grim lesson. Examples include \"The Bugaboo Bear\" (in which a little blond girl, buys a \"Bugaboo Bear\", and treats it as a person, only after a surprisingly short amount of time she gets bored with it, and starts treating it in a horrid manner), and \"William the Conkerer\" (in which a young lad, who destroys trees, attempts to steal every conker in the village). The programme also focuses on frightening children into believing their parents.",
