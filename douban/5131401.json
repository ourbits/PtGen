From innocent pranks to small adventures in the nearby forest, she spends most of her time with her 11 year-old cousin Sanjay. However, their fraternal love will be shattered when Sanjay will fail to save her from her fate: as a girl becomes a woman, she is the victim of an ancient and brutal ritual that leaves her scarred for life. This ceremony, although forbidden, is still practiced in parts of the country today. - IMDb",
