    "introduction": "Lenka returns from Prague to her native village somewhere in southeast Moravia. Life and time flow a little differently here. Lenka needs to rest and recharge her batteries after the divorce. She comes in time when her father decides to sink to the bottom of the dam to find a buried box of plum brandy in the flooded house. In addition, the local cemetery has just run out of space. Extension is not possible, incineration is completely unthinkable. Divine peace will disrupt the debate over the idea of a local vagabond to start burying vertically. Everyone has something to say and it gets really busy. And Lenka's tai-chi practice in the garden also seems very inappropriate. What awaits the next deceased in the end? And most importantly - when and who will it be?",
