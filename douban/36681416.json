    "introduction": "A few years prior to this film, Edvard Munch's film camera, display and four rolls of film have been found and delivered to the Munch Museum in Oslo. This finding, along with Munch's photographic self-portraits, written notes and texts, has made the \"Narrator\" (played by Frank Robert) to embark on a trip to European places where Munch stayed, and see the same things like Munch saw. Gradually, the \"Narrator\" will be able to see for himself.",
