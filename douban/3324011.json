The Academic Film Archive cited Yust's short as \"one of the two bestselling educational films ever\".Larry Yust's short film, The Lottery (1969), produced as part of Encyclop?dia Britannica's \"Short Story Showcase\" series, was ranked by the Academic Film Archive as \"one of the two bestselling educational films ever\". It has an accompanying ten-minute commentary film, Discussion of \"The Lottery\" by USC English professor Dr. James Durbin. Featuring the film debut of Ed Begley, Jr., Yust's adaptation has an atmosphere of naturalism and small town authenticity with its shots of pick-up trucks and townspeople in Fellows, California.",
