    "introduction": "Brotherhood of Men is a tale about love and hate, family ties and loneliness, cruelty and forgiveness. It shows that even kinsfolk can be very implacable to each other. A father has to bring up his two sons alone. He tries to instill in them brotherly love, the ideas of forgiveness, fairness and mutual support. But it is not easy as these implacable boys have quite different rules and values and live in their own brutal world. The father uses every means at his disposal to end the mutual hostility between his sons...- Written by Studio SLON",
