    "introduction": "George Kuchar's underground comedy classic has to be one of my favourite films of all time. 30 mins of fever-pitched melodrama, complete with infidelities, suicide, bowel dysfunction, alcoholism, tragic accidents and bad weather.Brilliantly over-performed by the cast of cult stars like Thundercrack's Marion Eaton (belive me, you haven't seen drama until you see her put out the trash!) and wonderfully directed by Kuchar with an eye for high camp and low moralsThis, in a suitably knackered out print, was a regular and much loved visitor to London's much missed Scala cinema and was finally released as part of the \"Colour Me Lurid\" VHS by the BFI in the early 90s (with the nearly as good \"Hold Me While I'm Naked\") but really needs to be part of a more exhaustive and LONG overdue DVD release of Kuchars delirious back catalogueFans of John Waters will love this and it stands as a testament to creativity and humour over budget. Wonderful - just wonderful.",
