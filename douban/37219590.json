    "introduction": "Geoffrey West, a traveler and adventurer, sees a girl in a London hotel and uses the personals column of a newspaper to get in touch with her. The girl, Marion Larnard, then sets a test for Geoffrey: he is to write her a letter each day for 5 days and, if he proves himself to be an interesting fellow, she will have dinner with him. As a joke, Geoffrey convinces Marion that he has done away with a certain Captain Fraser-Freer; Marion is, at first, quite concerned, but when she realizes that Geoffrey is jesting, she decides to teach him a lesson. She arranges with Fraser-Freer to disappear and has Geoffrey arrested for his murder. Letting Geoffrey fret for a while, Marion eventually arranges for his release and assures him that he has indeed proved himself to be an interesting fellow.",
