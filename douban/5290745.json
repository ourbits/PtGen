    "introduction": "Katsuhiro Yamaguchi and Hakudo Kobayashi presented the video performance Eat at Video Hiroba's first exhibition, Video Communication DO IT YOURSELF KIT. Two performers sit at a table. One records the other eating; then they switch roles. The live video feed of the performance was displayed on a monitor in the exhibition space.In 1951, with the encouragement of Shuzo Takiguchi, Katsuhiro Yamaguchi formed Jikken Kōbō with Shozo Kitadai, Kideko Fukushima, Toru Takemitsu, Joji Yuasa, Hiroyoshi Suzuki, and Kuniharu Akiyama. The collective's activities revolved around the incorporation of technology into art and supported the emergence of the media art genre in postwar Japan. In 1972, Yamaguchi was a central member of Video Hiroba, and in 1975 he presented his work at the S?o Paulo Art Biennial. He founded the group Āru Jeni in 1982 and has since produced numerous environmental video installations. Among his seminal works are the Vitrine series, Image Modulator (1969), Las Meninas (1974-75), and Uzu no naka no onna (1977).",
