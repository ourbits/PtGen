    "introduction": "HOW SCIENCE CAN HELP US SURVIVE NATURE’S DANGEROUS THREATSAustralia is a land of extremes with a well-deserved reputation for danger.Home to some of the world’s most venomous creatures, and regularly hit by apocalyptic fire storms and raging floods – Australia faces unique challenges to survival.In an era in which the role humans play in natural systems is more critical than ever, this three-part series dives deep into science, technologies and recent discoveries to ‘decode’ these dangers - and understand how best to both survive and thrive.Technological advances provide solutions that would have been unthinkable only a generation ago: robots can learn to recognise endangered eagles, sharks can be safely repelled by new devices that exploit their million-year-old biology. By drawing on ancient Indigenous knowledge and cutting-edge digital tools, we can better prepare for bushfires as they develop into 21st century firestorms. By mimicking the techniques of species that have evolved in harsh environments, we can learn to draw water out of air, and build buildings that breathe.And by looking into the deep past, we can learn valuable lessons to help prepare for the future.Episode 1 PredatorsEpisode 2 FloodsEpisode 3 FirestormProduction Company: Wildbear Entertainment",
