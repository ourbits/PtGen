    "introduction": "Fighting for a Generation: 20 Years of the UFC is an oral and visual documentary on the two decade rise of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. Over 60 interviews were conducted over a 4 month period to let the viewer truly understand how the UFC has become what it is today. From the early days, dealing with political pressure and financial hardships to successfully building a worldwide brand, the UFC has gone through struggles that no other sports franchise has faced only to come out on the winning end. With the 20 year anniversary of UFC 1 occurring in November 2013, the UFC wanted to celebrate in a way that would give the fans an inside look at the meteoric rise of one of the top sports franchises in the world.",
