    "introduction": "Oscar-nominated filmmaker Hanna Polak takes her camera to Sinjar in northern Iraq, deep in the territory where the Islamic State attempted to wipe out the Yazidi people. She gives voice to Hanifa, who is trying to free her sisters, or to Saeed, Nadia Murad's brother. Both have decided to stay to try to free their loved ones and seek justice. Through their testimonies, we witness all the horror of a forgotten genocide, the ordeal of a people who are denied all their rights, as well as their strength and courage.This movie contains violent and graphic images that may be harmful and traumatising to some. Viewer discretion is advised.",
