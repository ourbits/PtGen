Jan is in his final year of primary school, with a few months left until his graduation, and Maja is a psychologist at the same school.The film begins with the reopening of the schools after the end of the pandemic, but the children do not seem to have returned to the way things were before. Jan starts being bullied by his peers for no reason, and Maja makes an enemy in the form of a young woman, also a psychologist, played by Klara Kuk. Jan meets a mysterious man whose support he seeks in distress, but the price he will have to pay is high.",
