    "introduction": "Bay Area filmmaker Gibbs Chapman presents his most recent film, which he describes as “a weekend seminar on the irrelevance of human achievement in geologic time.” For David Finkelstein writing in Film Threat, “Gibbs Chapman vigorously skewers every possible intellectual approach to living in what he calls ‘an indifferent universe.’ In doing so with humor and a large dose of compassion, the film makes an impassioned plea for tolerance and understanding, a plea all the more effective for being in the film’s structure rather than its rhetoric.”",
