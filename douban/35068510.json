    "introduction": "In 1994, Mexican presidential candidate Colosio garnered attention for his democratic ideology and anti-corruption stance until he was shot through the head in Tijuana. The wondrous ColOZio, which is partly based on true events, starts three days prior with a prophecy to tripping friends Diego and Gael: save Colosio from death. The duo's dancing in a kaleidoscopic animated, almost 10-minute-long title sequence subsequently sets the tone for a playful, delightfully over-the-top road movie. Expect mythical apparitions, cartoony chases and plenty of drink and drugs.ColOZio is Artemio Narro's second feature film. Whereas his debut Me queudo contigo (IFFR 2015) used horror conventions to comment on the omnipresent violence in Mexico, ColOZio is an idiosyncratic mix of adventurous odyssey and political reality. Ultimately, as in every epic, the inner journey is crucial.",
