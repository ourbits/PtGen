    "introduction": "On the night of November 12, 2019 Venice was hit by a series of floods that submerged the city for a week. Starting from the images of his home and his studio flooded the director tells firsthand what it means to live day by day with high water and how his city faces catastrophe. The result is a reflection on living in the forefront of climate change which threatens to make our world disappear. —Giovanni Pellegrini",
