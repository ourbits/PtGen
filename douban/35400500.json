    "introduction": "Between mountain curves and endless rows of public housing, through shifting landscapes of faith and pain, four people exist. A mother, a father, two brothers: a family. Omer, the older brother, takes care of them all. His younger brother Uri, married with two kids, is a hopeless gambler who repeatedly pulls the family into darkness, making them weaker and weaker. Pain is transmitted from one to the other. Omer works in security at the Ben Gurion Airport of Tel Aviv when racism in Israel seems to be at its peak. The harassment of tourists who are about to leave the country is exposed through his actions. In many ways, his behaviour at the airport parallels the actions of his younger brother. Omer’s relationships with each of his close family members constructs his silent but impossible attempts to hold them together as a family.",
