    "introduction": "Island of Ischia. It was here that Luchino Visconti decided to spend all his summers from 1945, the place where he began to write his second film, \"La Terra Trema\", which he shot in 1947. To find peace and inspiration Visconti took refuge at the 'Colombaia', the villa surrounded by greenery, overlooking the sea, testimony to the impossibility of the director to leave his aristocratic world, a condition that was both an obstacle and a stimulus for all his professional activity. By evoking the splendor of the past, as opposed to the decadence in which the villa finds itself today, the film questions Visconti's intimacy, his artistic choices, his human and professional relationships, and his contradictory political commitment.",
