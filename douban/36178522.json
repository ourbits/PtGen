    "introduction": "Dirty Truckers is based on True events from the 1980's during mass unemployment in Britain. The Story has been altered to present day with again mass unemployment. Names have also been changed to protect their privacy. This is based on a Group of Truck Drivers who each are trying to keep the lives, livelihoods, and their Tipper Trucks on the road. The people who run the plants in the quarry and those who distribute the work to the drivers are very corrupt. The Lads all have completely different lives but when they meet up, they realize that they all have the same thing in common. They are all skint and they need to make lots of money. And make it quick. The lads get tangled up in more than they realize and must keep a low profile with the Quarry, other Drivers and another couple of little problems, Mafia and Police. Can they get away with it? Can they change their lives for the better?",
