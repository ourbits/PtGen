    "introduction": "Chloé, a beautiful young French actress, moves to Los Angeles to further her acting career and escape her troubled past. Joining a small theatre troupe, she finds her life spinning out of control into a strange parallel universe dominated by her obsessions. Every Sunday as her acting group meets, Chloé is driven closer and closer to the edge - where her imaginary life threatens to take complete control over her. As an American parody of French cinema, 40 Sundays was filmed on locations in Los Angeles and the south of France. Award-winning director Geoffrey de Valois brings this modern fairy tale nightmare to life with actors Chloé Domange, Amy Lyndon, Michael Laurie, Jesus Guevara, Claudine Guerrero, Alexander Hatzidiakos, Richard Lund, Ann Nguyen, Ashley St. Pierre, Emma Lynch, Christopher Slade, Edward L. Green, Dylan Hutchins, Pasquale Cassalia, Brian Graham, Eliezer Ortiz, Zachary Titus, Aleia Ramsey, and Eric Fine.",
