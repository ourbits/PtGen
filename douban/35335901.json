    "introduction": "The film recounts the return to Naples, following forty years spent in Buenos Aires, of Roberto, a writer who is now blind, of his meeting with his brother Lorenzo and of the troubling past which emerges from their childhood memories, set against the backdrop of the city as we’ve never seen it before. “Naples is the protagonist of this story”, the director insists, “almost dream-like, spectral and crepuscular, a seemingly deserted city. We don’t see the passers-by, the cars or the mopeds, the women yelling from down below or from balconies, or the children in the street. We see no characters other than the protagonists themselves, but we’re alerted to the vitality of the city through the sounds and voices of its inhabitants”.",
