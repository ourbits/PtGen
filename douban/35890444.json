    "introduction": "Setting out from the legacy left behind by uranium mining in former East Germany, this film weaves together clean-up operations, activism, family history, biotopes and a punk festival. Documentary and fantasy elements open up a field that is marked not only by the destruction caused by the mining but equally by the solicitous actions of residents.",
