    "introduction": "In a village in the Greek countryside, 55-year-old patriarch Takis (Akyllas Karazisis) and his long-suffering wife Eleni (Maria Kallimani) have been fighting with their loud-mouth neighbour, who is laying claim to part of the family’s land. As Takis prepares for the opening of his new butcher shop, decades of accumulated tensions between the two foes bubble to the surface. On one explosive night, the neighbour is killed by Takis’s only son Pavlos (Pavlos Iordanopoulos), a fumbling and hotheaded overgrown child. The only witness to this carnal crime is Christos (Kostas Nikouli), a handsome and hardworking young man from Albania, whom Takis has employed — and in many ways raised — since adolescence. The murderer and the eyewitness initially bury the evidence of the brutal act, but as rumours swirl and a killer must be named, the truth begins to take many forms. Soon, Takis must face the reality of choosing the fate of both young men.",
