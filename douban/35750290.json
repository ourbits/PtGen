    "introduction": "Filmed in Cyprus, Emin & Emin (1996) features the artist and her father on the beach. A native of the island, Emin’s father was a complicated figure in her life, he abandoned the family when Emin was a young girl in Margate and as a result, both his presence and absence informed much of her art. Set against the sound of crashing waves, we hear her father softly singing a lullaby in Turkish. Emin recites a short poem about the near spiritual bond of family, the last words of which are, “I love you Daddy.”",
