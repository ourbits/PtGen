    "introduction": "Two young men rival each other for the love of a young woman before and during a time of conflict.. Before the war a husband attempts to stop his wife having an affair with a young writer and states that he does not wish to be hurt again. The young woman refuses to remain faithful, and even after he offers a final reconciliation she rejects him. As the war starts both men are forced to join the army. The writer flees and is arrested and the rejected husband becomes an officer. They are brought together in a military prison, and are both tested. The young woman leaves the city and goes to the prison hoping that she can change the course of events. The war ends and she returns to a city that is no longer recognizable. This sense of loss and loneliness leads her to a cliff's edge. An old man climbs a mountain to die in the cold having never been able to reconcile himself with the woman he loves.",
