    "introduction": "The beautiful English countryside is the setting for more mysteries featuring the charismatic clergyman sleuth.Based on the classic character created by GK Chesterton. The quaint Cotswolds are abuzz with dastardly intrigue. Father Brown’s new ally is a playwright priest who’s written the perfect murder. But is art imitating death? There’s medieval murder at a battle re-enactment, a new nemesis lurking in the shadows and an old one who’s not quite as we remember him. And there are wedding bells for Chief Inspector Sullivan—until the secret is out that he’s not the real sleuth of the parish.It’s now 1955 and Chief Inspector Sullivan and Mrs Devine have grown closer since we saw them last – something that hasn’t escaped the notice of Father Brown and Brenda. With a food fayre to die for, a real-life crime at a crime writing festival and a village rivalry that turns deadly, there’s plenty for the gang to be busy with. And when his old friend Sister Boniface is implicated in a murder at an arts and craft fair, Father Brown must prove her innocence – before it’s too late.",
