    "introduction": "Presented by **Michael Buerk**, Pompeii is resurrected from its burial under 2,000 years of volcanic ash using a combination of CGI and historical expertise, to create a photorealistic virtual portrait of the city. Viewers are taken through 24 hours in the city - from the commute in the morning to brutal sports at noon and a plenitude of vices by night. The stories of how people lived are underpinned by archaeological research. Its a valuable and vivid picture of what life was like before this famous city was enshrined in molten rock.- Composer: Ned Bouhalassa- Executive Producer: Dan Adamson, Andrew Mackenzie, Anthony Appell, Alan Handel- A United Kingdom/Canada Co-Production- Co-produced by Twofour Broadcast Limited and Handel Productions Inc.- In association with ITV Broadcasting Limited, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and Canal D",
