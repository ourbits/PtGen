    "introduction": "At 30, Patrick O'Brien was TransFatty: NYC DJ, Internet personality, filmmaker. Then he was diagnosed with ALS. Given 2-5 years to live, Patrick braves the unthinkable and turns his camera onto himself. Forcefully lacking self-pity, he captures the emotion, humor, and absurdity of real life as he makes art, gets political, falls in love, and fathers a son.",
