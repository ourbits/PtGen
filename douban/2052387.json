    "introduction": "LOCO LOVE is predictable fun. It is one of those films that after the first ten minutes, you know where it is going, and how it is going to end. This is a straight forward story that goes from point A to point B with very few twists along the way. Boy meets Girl. Boy and Girl hate each other. Boy and Girl love each other. Boy and Girl break off their relationship. Boy and Girl get back together. Fortunately there are enough fun scenes along the way to make the journey worth taking.The beginning starts out a bit shaky with a jerky exposition and an incredibly bad mustache. It is apparent that this film was made on a very low budget. I thought I was going to hate this film. However, the story slowly became endearing. It's a Taming of the Shrew meets Trading Places kind of story.The story was hampered by the producer/director trying to be too politically correct. The relationship between Donald and Cat also seemed a bit rushed, but it worked well enough keep my interest. What made this film entertaining was the cast of character actors and the little one-liners they were given.While LOCO LOVE is not great entertainment, it is good enough to nuke some popcorn, curl up on the couch and watch this awkward, silly romantic comedy.",
