    "introduction": "Episodes:1.Rich's Mother2.Matt's Diary3.Punchline4.Oh Brothers5.Love Triangle6.WeddingBBC3 has brought some fantastic comedy shows to our screens over the last few years like little Britain and the mighty boosh. Snuff box is no exception, in fact it is hilarious and my favourite show of 06, though it isn't to everyones taste.Matt berry and Rich Fulcher star as a hangman and his American assistant respectably, It is based somewhere in upper class London, which for some reason has a lot mentally ill people roaming the streets. The pair spend their days hanging condemned souls for cash, chasing women and sitting in their rather posh gentleman's club sipping whiskey.The plot may seem strange but believe me, the comedy moments are priceless and couldn't be achieved by any other show, for example, the execution scenes where we see lads doing their job, hanging criminals with the priest who would rather be down the 'rubber dub' than stand around reading the last rights all day. It may seem sick but it is funny.With original music including the awesome theme tune (written and composed by Berry),various sketch-like scenes and the incredible comedy double act of Berry and Fulcher, all in all a top show which, if you give it a chance, will have you in stitches.",
