    "introduction": "When Tom, a stoic Midwest husband and dad, gets laid off from a car assembly line, he makes the extraordinary decision to provide for his family by following his dream of becoming a professional bowler. As a skilled player, Tom knows that in bowling no matter what you do with the first ball, you get another one to make it right--the ultimate second chance. Keeping that in mind, Tom begins his new career with the loving OK from his wife and the unfaltering support of Archie, his mentor and the proud owner of Archie's Lanes: Home of the Curly Fry. It remains to be seen if Tom will strike it big on the pro bowler circuit, but the pins are set and he's taking his second shot.",
