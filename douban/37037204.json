    "introduction": "Woman, life, freedom! After the death of a young Iranian woman in Teheran, thousands take to the streets – in Germany too. Portrait of a protest which brought different generations together. On 13th September 2022, Jina Mahsa Amini was arrested by the Iranian vice squad because she was wearing her headscarf wrongly. Three days later, she died in custody. Her death set off a howl of protest all over the world. Many exiled Iranians, who fled the new regime in Tehran in the 1970s, protested – but also 2nd generation German-Iranians like Jasmin Shakeri, Pegah Ferydoni, Natalie Amiri and Enissa Amani. Together they took to the streets to help the old country find freedom.",
