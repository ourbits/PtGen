    "introduction": "Three German teenagers—Ira, Malin, and Ka—have just graduated from high school. As it is a rite of passage for teenagers everywhere, the trio decides to commemorate this milestone with a road trip. Once settled in Italy, the trio embarks in search of adventure. On the road, they pick up an intriguing backpacker, Zoe, who tags along on their journey. But when they stumble across an abandoned village, the quartet starts to experiment with the limits of their newly found freedom, away from the expectations of their parents and teachers.源自：https://www.tribecafilm.com/films/dead-girls-dancing-2023",
