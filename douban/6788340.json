    "introduction": "\"The work is a found footage work: i.e., a montage of short clips from existing films. The films are from all over the world, including Fran c e, chinese mainland, Hong Kong, India, the US, etc. Each of the clips shows an image of a clock marking the time. The work lasts for 24 hours, and it is synchronized with the time of the location where it is shown. For instance, if you see the work in London and it is now 11:25 AM, then you will see on the screen a clock or watch pointing at exactly that time.It has been shown in London, New York, and Venice. It received an award in Venice. \"- Hector RODRIGUEZhttp://www.whitecube.com/exhibitions/cm/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Marclay",
