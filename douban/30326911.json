    "introduction": "Lumley's team examines the theory that Noah's Ark was preserved on Mount Ararat, in Turkish Armenia. First she elaborates on the wide-spread tradition of a massive flood, before and after the Biblical version starring the prophet, and scientific interpretation. Then the ark itself, an improbable shipbuilding project for all Antiquity. Finally Ararat itself, and the relative unimportance whether the Ark is real, as opposed to so many people believing in it.",
