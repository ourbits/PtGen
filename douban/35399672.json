    "introduction": "A musician decides to goes off the grid after the sudden passing of his girlfriend. He moves into a vacant house and plans to take his own life until a ghost interferes. A new short film by James Lee. Director's Statement Since watching David Lowery's A Ghost Story (2017), I was totally amazed by the film, story, the music and of all the screen ratio. And my short film itself is inspired by he movie and also a good exercise to film and block for the 4:3 ratio. And the short film was also shot with no full finished script, so a couple of scenes were improvised, sometimes on location. Shot over 3 days on Sony A6400 with mainly an 7Artisans 12mm and a Sony 35mm.—doghouse73",
