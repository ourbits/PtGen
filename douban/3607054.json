    "introduction": "Sherlock Holmes is approached by Mr. Scott-Eccles who recounts strange events. He recently dined with an acquaintance, a Spanish gentleman named Diaz with whom he shared an interest in map making. He spent the night at Mr. Diaz' rented home, Wisteria Lodge, but awoke the next morning to find the house abandoned. Thinking that Diaz might be doing a runner, he contacted the landlord but was told that the man's rent had been paid in full. A somewhat bored Holmes agrees to look into these mysterious circumstances surrounding the case but the local constabulary, in the form of Inspector Baynes, make it very clear that he is out to make a reputation for himself by solving this case without the Great Detective's help.
