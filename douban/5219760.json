    "introduction": "This is a feature-length documentary on Mar adentro, or The Sea Inside, found on the DVD of it. It's rather well-done, and provides good insight into the making of it. It holds a few clips from the movie, but consists almost entirely of interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, inter-cut. You get to see every stage of development and creation, including co-script-writer, Mateo Gil... one has to wonder why there is so little of him, was he just not present, much or at all, during the later periods, because he sure was fun to listen to. Pre-production, filming, post, and an appropriate amount of time and attention spent on each portion of the three parts. The pacing is relatively deliberate, fitting for its subject. I got even more respect for Bardem from watching this. I got the sense that Amenábar has matured, going away from the genre of horror(I am in no way passing judgment, I have a great amount of respect for both that genre and his earlier work), and would say that it will be interesting to see what he brings us in the future. As the other material on the disc, this is subtitled. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the piece itself, are fans of Alejandro and/or are interested in the craft, even as just a hobby.",
