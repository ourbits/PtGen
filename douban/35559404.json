    "introduction": "Everyone knows that the best possible friendship is that between a dog and its owner. Old people often own pets so they feel less lonely and have something to care for, and a dog is undoubtedly the best option to bring joy to a home. However, dogs also get old and start losing their energy and skills. Henry’s owner tells his daughter about his day-to-day and the habits and routines he must abide by, since his “good old dog” is more tired now. With a calm, tender, and humorous narrative, “Old Dog” conveys the mutual love and affection between dog and human, and how necessary they are in each other’s lives.",
