    "introduction": "长命百岁是否必然幸福？ 孝与不孝如何界定？ 离与留又该如何取舍？纪录片《伴生》娓娓道来两代人对生与死的价值观的差异和矛盾。有人因不忍父亲饱受病魔折磨及丧妻之苦，而祈求父亲能早归天家；有人因长期照顾患病父母而心生压力，渴望开展自己的生活；有人因母亲健康急转直下反而重建分隔多年的关系。 一生建构的种种链接，伴随死亡，是否能瞬间化为烟霞？\"Does longevity bring happiness? Would it be unfilial if you wish the death for your father? Departure or continuous to suffer, a hard choice to make?Snuggle shows the value difference of 'life and death' between two generations. Someone wishes the death for his father because he cannot stand watching his father suffering from illness and loneliness; someone feels so stressed that she has to sacrifice her life to take care of her parents; someone happens to restore the relationship with his mother because she is unwell seriously. When it comes to death, would all those relationships we have in this life last for one more second?\"第23届香港电影评论学会大奖",
