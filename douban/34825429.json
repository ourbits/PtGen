    "introduction": "NO SMALL MATTER confronts America's most pressing problems with an unlikely but powerful weapon: babies and young children. From home to childcare to preschool, high-quality early care and education has far-reaching impacts, and groundbreaking science to back it up. With a healthy dose of humor and a surprising edge, No Small Matter reveals the tragic cost of getting this wrong, and the huge payoff-for our kids, our families, and our country-of getting it right.",
