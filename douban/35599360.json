    "introduction": "On the ski track, sports school pupils are training. Trainers Nika (30) and Nata (28) lead a group of teenagers. While training, Nika sneaks out with his 15-year-old student Ana to the upper track. On their route down, the girl falls off the mountain. Nika does not tell anyone about the incident, but at dinner, it turns out that the girl with the number 26 is missing. The search for Anna begins. Police interrogation reveals that wrapped in \"teenage\" intrigues, Ana had such a tense relationship with her peers that nobody really cares about her. Meanwhile, Nika pretends as if the girl has disappeared just from sight, and tries to find a way to confuse the policeman with a new intrigue - theft in the children's room. Nata observes Nika's disguised act from the very first moment, conducts her own investigation and suddenly reminds Nika about his footprints on snow, and his relationship with Ana.",
