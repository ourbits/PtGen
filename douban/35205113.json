    "introduction": "Chanhui and Seyeong, a couple in a long-term relationship, find themselves tiring of each other as life becomes difficult. Chanhui wanted to become a photographer, but is now a salesperson in a camera store. Meanwhile, Seyeong works in a nail salon, feeling a lack of hope for the future. One day, Chanhui realizes that a financially secure man with a steady job has been showing interest in Seyeong. Needless to say, Seyeong, enjoys his attention. Not to lose his girlfriend to that man, Chanhui plans a trip to reconnect with Seyeong and refresh their relationship. However, their journey seems to go nowhere. While traveling, they constantly express love, open up more, fight with each other, and gain intimacy. Our Joyful Summer Days is the second feature film made by Lee Yu-bin, best known for her debut film Shuttlecock. It is worth watching how the film elaborately and sensitively explores the complex emotional experiences of young couples.",
