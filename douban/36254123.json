    "introduction": "Railroad ticket controller Sebastien just got his dream promotion and is moving south to sunny Marseilles with Lea, his pregnant fiancée. The house is rented, the move’s in three days, life is perfect.So, when Sebastien must undergo an evaluation on his final day, he figures it’s just a formality. Until he finds out his inspector will be the one that everybody fears, the one who’s insane - “but fair”.Things go south as soon as the first car, where Sebastien is confronted by a pack of troublemakers. But that’s nothing compared to what’s in store for him next, from escaped wildlife to emergency childbirth, every car is more challenging than the last… until he reaches the dreaded family car, where absolutely nothing is under control.But Sebastien’s nightmare is not over, as he realizes that Simon, his colleague who didn’t get the promotion, is also on board and irrationally hell-bent on revenge.To get what he wants, Sebastian will have to survive the most unhinged and hilariously wild ride, his last seven train cars as ticket controller.",
