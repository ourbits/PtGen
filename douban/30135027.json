    "introduction": "The film is set in the present day in a cultural and ethnographic reserve in Latvia, where the material world and atmosphere of the 1930s has been recreated as fully as possible. Upon entering the retreat, guests are required to leave behind all the accessories of modern life: clothing, vehicles and means of communication. A sudden summer heat wave drives the guests into madness, and the surreal and burlesque situation turns into the opposite of drama – a comedy.",
