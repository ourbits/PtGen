A story about loneliness and the subtle ways in which it affects individuals...In the tragicomic short film \"Havana, CUBA\", an ever-quiet taxi driver meets five different people over the course of one night during Christmas Holidays. An abused runaway wife, a failed actor, a lower-class young man and two teenagers making love in the back seat, all come together in this exotic farce of absurd proportions. A story of loneliness and the ways in which it subtly affects individuals bringing them on the brink of hysteria, Havana, CUBA explores the broader concept of being alone in a crowded world, while never forgetting the humour and the essential love for whatever makes us human.",
