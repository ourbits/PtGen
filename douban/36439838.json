Her father adores her, but because of his hard work, he sometimes fails to give her the attention she would like. One day, after yet another argument, Billie imprudently accepts an invitation from two strangers to a mysterious castle, full of sweets and toys. She soon discovers that it is the trap of a supervillain, who uses the anger and sadness of his captives as fuel for his maxi-cannon that is to destroy the entire world. It will be the Puffins who come to the rescue of young Billie, saving her from the evil villain’s clutches.",
