    "introduction": "Police chief Horst Krause and his sister Elsa have been looking after the inn in Schönhorst in Brandenburg since his well-earned retirement. It would be all good if Elsa wasn't suddenly so forgetful. A burning pan in the kitchen even calls the fire brigade onto the scene. Krause is very worried about Elsa. What will happen to the inn without her? Sister Meta and brother-in-law Rudi come back from Cologne, the family council is convened. Krause wants to sell without further ado, but Mayor Stübner vehemently opposes this plan in order to keep the inn in the place. But Krause is very stubborn and refuses any help - even that of the young cook Paula. Her little son is initially too much for the overwhelmed Krause. A trip with the sisters to their old home in Pomerania is supposed to calm the mind and do Elsa good. On returning home, Krause suddenly realizes why Meta had encouraged him to take this trip: Rudi has realized his very own ideas for the inn while they were all away. Can the family move back together in the end and find a common solution? That would be Krause's greatest hope.",
