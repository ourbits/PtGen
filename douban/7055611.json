    "introduction": "Mr. Dhanrajgir or Dadaji (Anupam Kher) is the paternal grandfather of Suraj (Salman Khan). Dadaji is concerned about the manner Suraj treats young ladies, he just flirts with them one after another. Then Suraj meets with the girl of his dreams, Komal Sinha (Twinkle Khanna). Komal lives with her uncle and aunt (Harish Patel and Himani Shivpuri), and does not appreciate Suraj's advances. So Suraj takes on the identity of Suraj Dhanwa, a childhood friend of Komal Sinha and her family. Komal accepts him and also falls in love with him. But then the real Suraj Dhanwa shows up, resulting in the break-up of both Suraj and Komal. Komal is not convinced that Suraj will stop his flirtatious attitude, and is hurt by his impersonating Mr. Dhanwa. Matters are further complicated when a child named Kabir shows up claiming that Suraj is his dad.",
