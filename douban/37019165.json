During Jung Bahadur Rana's rule (1846-1877), the aggrieved husband held the authority to execute the offending 'Jaar'. Rudraman's reappearance disrupts Thuli's settled life. Rudraman has to confront the choice between ignominy and a perilous pursuit at a village council. Cast out by society, Rudraman and Thuli embark on a perilous journey, cut off from the security of family and tradition.",
