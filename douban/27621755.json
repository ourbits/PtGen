    "introduction": "After years of being perpetually stoned, drunk, and jobless in the hood, Chelo Chavez needs to get his shit together. At least that’s what his girlfriend, Angie, says. After emerging unscathed from multiple gunshots delivered by a mysterious man in a flower truck, Chelo discovers that he has superhuman powers—but only when he’s drunk or high. With the help of his homies, he embarks on a mission to test his new abilities and uncover his own origin story. We are excited to present the first three episodes of this digital series from director Carlos López Estrada.",
