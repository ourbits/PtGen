    "introduction": "When the case against the Abingdon gang comes under scrutiny, Morse and Lewis must travel to Australia to locate their prime informant who was resettled there with his entire family in exchange for the information he provided the police. When they get there, they find the informant, Kenny Stone (now known as Mike Harding), is somewhat difficult to pin down. When they learn that someone in Mike's family subscribes to a newspaper from home, they fear that members of his old gang may also be looking for him. When Harding's daughter is kidnapped, they have two people to find, but not surprisingly Morse and the local constabulary knock heads from the outset. What Morse learns about the original convictions, however, turns the entire case on its head.",
