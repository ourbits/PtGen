    "introduction": "A flash in the memory stirs from dormancy, the urge to question fragments of time already lived, opening a pathway to a new view of the past. Like a damaged document, there is a yearning to gather the pieces, to reconstruct and imagine what’s missing, perceiving the cracks in memory as spaces for liberation and the rebuilding of desire. Can a child, immersed in this flow through memory, dreams, and speculation, rediscover happiness? Because for a child, everything still lies ahead, and all possibilities remain open. In Joie de vivre, the answer is yes.",
