    "introduction": "Tabel is an experiment in VR storytelling that provides you a delectable balance between an interactive and a passive viewing experience using a unique directional audio technique. There are six story lines that unfold simultaneously during the 7 minute film. By looking around, you can choose which stories to listen to by looking in the direction of any character in the film. The directional audio was built specifically for this VR film and Tabel was created and written with this audio technique in mind. Tabel is a story that needs to be digested. It is an experience made for immersive VR. The VR format allows you to taste and absorb the cacophony of characters and story lines, while actively participating in the story itself.

Tabel is an experience that will be felt...",
