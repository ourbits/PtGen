    "introduction": "After the release of Is This It, the Strokes toured around the world, featuring dates in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and North America staging for the Rolling Stones. The band headlined UK's Carling Weekend festivals in 2002, largely chronicled by a mini-documentary entitled \"In Transit\" which was released to members of the now-defunct \"Alone, Together\" fan club. Today it can be seen on their official website.本片是一部由The Strokes成員用DV攝製的紀錄片 拍攝于2002年左右 僅對Fan Club限量發行DVD 裏面有許多有趣的内容 現在在The Strokes的官網可以看到片斷。",
