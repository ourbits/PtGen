    "introduction": "There's always a new fad, whether that be a terrible hairstyle, gag-worthy fashion, or theme parties. But for Michelle and Jerry, it's the latest trend in-vogue that prompts them to invite all their closest friends to a relaxing weekend getaway: a divorce party. Michelle's blooming career has left Jerry in the dust and they've grown apart ... together. Through a (seemingly) mutual separation, both parties agree a getaway to close their romantic chapter makes the most sense when their friends accompany them. Of course each set of friends comes with their own wacky baggage. Between divorce, weekend pranks, the pressures of pregnancy, a gay love affair, and a drunken tryst, Matthew Aaron's latest film focuses on the way we treat each other and The Way We Talk.",
