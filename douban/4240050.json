    "introduction": "Written and directed by Susumo Hani, this French-Italian-Japanese documentary film chronicles the life of the director's 6-year-old daughter Mio (Mio Hani), a Japanese girl who moves with her family to Sardinia. This film tells the story of her adaptation to her new setting and the adaptation the local children make to her. It begins with her first day of school as she walks in wearing a large name-tag and speaking not one word of Italian. Her world and her new community are artfully depicted in this film as, gradually, she moves from being the butt of jokes to being accepted by her new schoolmates.",
