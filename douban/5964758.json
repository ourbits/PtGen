    "introduction": "The best part is when Stacy Ferguson, Carol-Ann Plante, and Kellie Williams go shopping on Melrose Avenue. They act like three crazy girls who skip down the street, walk like The Monkees, make silly faces, eat pizza (while the camera zooms in on them), try on an assortment of strange clothes from the year 1991, play with dolls, etc. They even do a little dance number in their loud, colorful clothes and it looks like something from \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\". Carol-Ann and Kellie even put on a lot of leather and try on different styles of sunglasses. They sure do want to impress those California boys.",
