    "introduction": "Archaeologist Olivier Weller and his team decided to conduct a dig at one of the locations where Jacques Demy shot several scenes from his film Donkeyskin (Peau d'Âne) : the cabin where Catherine Deneuve hides out, the clearing where Delphine Seyrig welcomes her goddaughter,... Sets and props are long gone but pearl-beads, nails, sequins and other traces are revealed at the first tentative scrapings of the surface.Following that survey, Skin Deep Fairytale tries to approach the magic of film-maker Jacques Demy's work, the charm of Charles Perrault's text, the tale's power of fascination, whose origins go back to oral tradition. Are we researching the story, or is it reserching us? The quest of our film archaeologist goes much farther and deeper that he would have imagined himself.",
