    "introduction": "The premise of this season was Núñez and Peck going head-to-head for the first time in Ink Master history where thirty artists battled for a spot on either team, with both teams consisting of nine artists each. The first seven episodes featured each team battling their own members in an elimination-style competition for a spot in the top ten. Then, the top five artists on Team Núñez battled Team Peck's top five artists. The winner of the eighth season of Ink Master was Ryan Ashley Malarkey, who became the first female winner in the competition, with Gian Karle Cruz being the runner-up.",
