    "introduction": "It is the first time that Jun works as a seasonal worker in the rice sowing campaign. Despite being a second generation Chinese youth, Jun has never had a real interest in rice culture as he has always steered away from his Asian origins, even though his own grandmother, who lives in China, has been a rice farmer all her life. However, sharing the days with a family of farmers who have also grown rice for generations will gradually make him begin to question what his true roots are. But he won't do it alone. He will be accompanied by the buzz of the mosquitoes, the noise of the tractors and yes, also the continuous calls from his mother.",
