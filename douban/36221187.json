    "introduction": "Frédéric Savoye and Wolimité Sié Palenfo take a new look at the history of French colonisation in the Lobi region in south-western Burkina Faso. Villages and families in this region still bear the burden of memories of this painful period. Compared and contrasted with the official records of the colonial administration, the oral tradition allows history to be traced back for nearly a century, from the arrival of the first White men until the modern era. Using statements of personal experience from several generations, the film builds up a critical analysis of colonisation and its consequences for individuals, society and religion.",
