    "introduction": "In 2018 we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of one of the most discussed historical events of the 20th century: the cultural and political revolution of 1968. For the first time we will also take a close look at the global shock wave, caused by the US entry into the war, from a variety of national perspectives - leading to an overall picture of the 68-movement: From the US to Vietnam, from Japan to Germany, Brazil, France, Mexico, China and the Congo. Despite national differences the movements were united in a common protest culture that touched upon all life areas: flower power, music and drugs were part of the protest as well as peaceful demonstrations, brutal violence and counter violence.",
