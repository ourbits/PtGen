    "introduction": "The movie follows the working-class twosome, who cannot find steady employment and soon become financially deprived. The wife instructs the husband to rob their elderly neighbour; however, Jaroslav underestimates the situation, and the petty burglary turns into robbery and murder. As investigators do not seem to be paying much attention to the incident, the couple come up with their modus operandi for targeting pensioners in the isolated village.While the film centres on the pair, the story is perceived from Jaroslav’s perspective, as he becomes susceptible to the manipulation of his wife. Dana becomes intoxicated by the power she thinks she can wield over another human being, and the feeling fuels yet more bloodlust. Hátle, who wrote the script himself, consulted the investigator’s files; however, he filled in the blanks in their personal life with the most plausible explanations behind the string of senseless murders.",
