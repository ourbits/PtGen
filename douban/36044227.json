    "introduction": "Synopsis: The lives of two sisters, Billie and Becca, residing in a small mid-western town, are about to change forever. The girls are unaware that there is a will which states, once Becca turns 18, they will inherit their parent's multi-million dollar farming estate. The girls' adoptive parents, Karen and Terry, take over the farming business after the girl's parents die in a car accident. Also killed in the accident are Billy and Becca's cousins. The loss of Karen and Terry's girls drives a wedge between them. Michelle, the family's business attorney, becomes aware of their plan to destroy the girls, which places her in danger. This intense feud escalates until it's all taken too far. The parents find ways to bury their grief with much hate and jealousy; however, the two find a bond in their self-proclaimed entitlement to this fortune they now stand to lose.",
