    "introduction": "Alison Wynn is an amateur triathlete who convinces Dr. Laura Stevens, a controversial peak-performance trainer, to take her on as a client. Together they embark on a rigorous program combining cutting-edge physical training with experimental hypnotherapy in an effort to render Alison more competitive. Pushed to her limits and forced to explore the painful repressed memories of her mother's suicide, Dr. Stevens' punishing regimen helps Alison post impressive gains and break through her own glass ceiling; but at what cost? Alison's work and family life with her husband and daughter suffer but no sacrifice seems too great to satisfy Laura's escalating demands. In fact Laura will do whatever it takes to have Alison all to herself. As Alison runs directly into Laura's sinister psychological trap, it's up to Alison's daughter to help her mother see through the deception before they lose her forever.",
