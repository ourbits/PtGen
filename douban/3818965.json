    "introduction": "A fictional suburb in the late 1970s. All inhabitants are identically attired: everyone wears an orange outer garment. And nothing else. Neither underwear nor pants. Until this state of affairs becomes too much for Mister R and his wife, and the couple revolts. With the help of a masked rebel in a blue R8 Gordini sports car, they launch a radical clothing revolution—a unprecedented assault upon monochrome orange totalitarianism.credit: Jean Christophe Lie, Prima Linea Productions",
