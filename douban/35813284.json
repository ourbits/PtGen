She comes back to her family after having spent some time abroad and finds a startling idyll shaped by the welfare generated by the German economic miracle that occurred during these years. Toni gets a job as a foreign-language secretary at the Gehlen Organization. After a while, she is approached by the director of the other, competing secret service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution, who believes that several members of the Gehlen Organization are war criminals. He wants her to be a double agent and help pursue them.",
