    "introduction": "In a stylish old theatre in Berlin, eight women young and old sit at a long table, which is lavishly covered with food and wine. The women are dressed in everything from latex clothes and corsets to a riding uniform. In addition to being a physical costume, the dramatic outfits symbolise the personae that each of them have adopted: the eight women earn their money satisfying their clients' sexual fantasies. And they merrily talk about their experiences with what they describe as a dream job, where they are paid for being desired. From passionate, sadistic role-playing to embarrassing anecdotes from their sessions. The women point out that the notion of prostitutes not putting their feelings into sex is outdated, while they cheerfully and openly reflect on their work and their clients' desires and urges. The entire film takes place in a theatre auditorium, where the camera gently rolls from side to side in a simple composition that is ironically reminiscent of Da Vinci's Renaissance work 'The Last Supper'. Norwegian artist Lene Berg's film is a pro-sexual, feminist performance that sets the stage for the debate that it will no doubt cause - with the theatre as the (free) space, which has historically been the setting for fantasies, temptations and seductive illusions.",
