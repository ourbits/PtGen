    "introduction": "In this tragic comedy, four interwoven stories tell Europe's current ways of dealing with the so-called migration crisis. Marie is a young volunteer, traveling directly to the Mediterranean Sea to help refugees. The youngster Marcel founds an organization for escorting women in order to protect them from the alleged dangerous migrants. The well-off Petra adopts an unaccompanied, underage refugee. And Gerald, the head of a refugee home, is challenged like never before by one of his protégés. ME, WE tells the story of four Europeans, whose attitudes toward migration and asylum is shattered forever.",
