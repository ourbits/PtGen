    "introduction": "Matthew’s life is devastated after the disappearance of his younger brother, Tom. Matthew’s father had left him to look after Tom and now Matthew feels responsible. His father is trying to hold back the anger and the blame but the cracks are beginning to show.\nOne day Matthew is looking through a box of press clippings and video tapes about Tom’s disappearance. Suddenly he hears a ghostly voice on one of the video tapes telling him “you never came for me!”. It’s the voice of his missing brother. He shows the tape to his father, Jake. This time there’s no voice and Jake flies into a rage as the wound is reopened.\nMatthew tells his best friend Simon about the voices on the tape. Is he losing his mind, is Tom alive or dead?\nAt home, Matthew plays the tape and hears Tom’s voice again, desperately pleading for help. Then Matthew sees Tom at the window, gaunt and haggard. He rushes out to Tom but no one is there…\nMatthew strikes up a friendship with next-door neighbour Amy, who is beautiful but troubled.  He talks to her about Tom and she suggests he visits a local medium. Matthew is unsure but he is again haunted by nightmarish visions of Tom. When he tries to sleep he has recurring nightmares that he is being buried alive.\nIn desperation he goes to visit Melissa, the medium, who tells him that the area has been cursed through the ages. Her daughter gives Matthew a present, the drawing of a young girl. The following day Matthew is shocked when he finds out that Simon’s sister, Sophie, has been abducted.  Matthew realises that the drawing by the medium’s daughter is of Sophie.\nThe hauntings escalate, Matthew’s state of mind deteriorates. Only Amy seems to believe him, as a tentative romance grows between them.\nMatthew knows that he needs to get to the bottom of Tom’s disappearance if he is ever going to save Sophie. There is no going back as he hurtles towards the stark, chilling truth…\nThe Disappeared…you can’t bury the past.",
