    "introduction": "Maïa will soon get married. It's an opportunity to get together with friends, during a weekend in the countryside. But the party gives way to melancholy: Maïa realizes all that she is burying with her life as a young girl.A film like spring, a bittersweet coming-of-age tale that feels very real in a joie-de-vivre way. This is a film about complex relations and about celebrating freedom, told as a nature-saturated love story with secret doors that sometimes even creek when closed, with everyone bathed in that special kind of light from that sun that only seems to shine for adolescents.",
