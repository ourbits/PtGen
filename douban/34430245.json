    "introduction": "Elisabeth Kübler-Ross devoted her life to death and dying and achieved world fame in the process. She de-stigmatized dying and drew attention to the treatment of the terminally ill. This remarkably intimate film was made when Kübler-Ross lived secluded in the desert, awaiting her own death - on the verge of the transition she researched so passionately.Conversations with Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in Arizona form the core of the film. She looks back on her life, describes her childhood and her work, and explains how she herself faces aging and impending death. Interviews with her sisters, friends and colleagues, as well as extensive archival material provide a comprehensive look into the life and work of this extraordinary woman.",
