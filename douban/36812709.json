    "introduction": "Based on real-life events, OPERATION SABRE tells the story of a year in Serbia following the killing of the nation's prime minister outside a government building in 2003. The event was a turning point in Serbia's political and social life. After the assassination, the country plunged into chaos, prompting the government to declare a state of emergency.  While the public knows who killed the prime minister, and why, Danica, a young journalist, is investigating the forces behind the tragic event. At the same time, Boris, a police inspector, gradually discovers the shortcomings of an investigation that reveals a chain of corruption leading back to crimes committed in the 1990s. Uros, a young criminal, becomes increasingly entangled with the criminal clan responsible for the assassination and finds it increasingly difficult to escape their grip.",
