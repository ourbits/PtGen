    "introduction": "From Executive Producer Stephen Fry, TRY HARD presents a whirlwind of repressed yearnings and urban loneliness. Supported by Sir Ian McKellen and starring Nicholas Gleaves, NIGHTSTAND stages the destructive relationship between two men over three consecutive nights - one is gay, lost and adolescent, the other is married to a woman and middle-aged. The cathartic and tender savagings of their affair unravel uniquely in the most under-represented corners of London nightlife. Inspired by the writer's experiences, this short film embraces both the vibrancy and fragility of London's queer landscape. And scored with original music inspired by the labyrinthine nocturnal metropolis, this work exposes the violent gentrification of Soho's dying queer landscape. NIGHTSTAND expresses the universal human desires to assert one's identity, to be independent, to find a home, to love and be loved.",
