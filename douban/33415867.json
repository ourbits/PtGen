    "introduction": "A mother hen is taking her brood for a walk. They encounter obstacles along the way, such as traffic. There's a runt of the litter, who has more trouble with these than the rest. Momma stalks an inch-worm; she shushes the chicks; of course, the runt keeps bumping into things and making noise. And the biggest hazard of all is the hawk. But just when it looks like the hawk is going to get the runt, a run-in with a skunk saves him.",
