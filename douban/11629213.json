    "introduction": "Water Water consists of images of a single chrome tap/fawcet. The film is constructed around several binary opposites; pixilation v mutation, animation v live action, black and white v colour, movement v stasis etc. These oppositions are both evident and yet impure in the way they interact with each other. The interactions arise partly through deliberate permutation of elements -colour, black and white and pixilation for example- and partly through the way the viewer's perception bears on them.",
