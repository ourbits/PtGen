    "introduction": "Jimmy T. Murakami is a world-renowned Oscar nominated animator whose credits include When the Wind Blows and The Snowman but there is one dark chapter in his life that he has not revealed until recently. During WW2, Japanese-American citizens like Jimmy and his family were evacuated to a concentration camp in the California desert. This film takes you on an extraordinary journey with Jimmy, from his adopted country Ireland, through his Hollywood career, climaxing with his return to camp to confront his childhood and his still present anger with the American government that put him there.",
