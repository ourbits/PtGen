    "introduction": "The Jewish Cardinal tells the amazing true story of Jean-Marie Lustiger; the son of Polish-Jewish immigrants; who maintained his cultural identity as a Jew even after converting to Catholicism at a young age; and later joining the priesthood. Quickly rising within the ranks of the Church; Lustiger was appointed Archbishop of Paris by Pope Jean Paul II - and found a new platform to celebrate his dual identity as a Catholic Jew; earning him both friends and enemies from either group. When Carmelite nuns settle down to build a convent within the cursed walls of Auschwitz; Lustiger finds himself a mediator between the two communities - and may be forced at last to choose his side.",
