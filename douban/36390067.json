Her striking black and white photos convey a tenderness and intimacy that set her apart from her peers and her work would become a powerful record of a world decimated by a new and ruthless form of capitalism. follows Tish’s daughter Ella as she revisits key moments from her mother’s life and work. She’s accompanied by people who remained close to Tish throughout her life, and who is committed to ensuring her remarkable legacy is recognised.源自：https://sheffdocfest.com/film/tish",
