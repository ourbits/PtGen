    "introduction": "This story follows one man and three women. Kutty Srank has relationships with three different women. According to testimony of three women, the true identity of Kutty Srank is different from each other but the same in his trustworthy nature.‘Blood’ crosses Kutty Srank’s fate. He is unintentionally involved with several deaths. When Ravamma, the first woman, tried to get away from her brutal father, he helps her. After losing Monk Prasanna, the only person who understood her, she leans on him. Playing a heroine in a traditional show performed with people in her village, Pemmana falls in love with one of the actors, Kutty Srank. Kali, who saved his life when he almost died after being bitten by a snake, also falls in love with him. All three women were either ignored or excluded by others in their community. Religion around them also joins in the prejudice and oppression. Kutty Srank gains trust by treating them with a dignity apart from their status or religion. Thus [Sailor of Hearts] is a uniquely themed film that tells of 'trust' that transcends social class and religion. (KIM Ji-Seok)",
