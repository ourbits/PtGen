    "introduction": "Through the lens of photographer and physician Eric Overton, Collodion: The Process of Preservation captures a fearless, and uncommonly vulnerable self-portrait of American wilderness, our relationship to each other, and the possibility that nature itself may be all we need to find common ground. Following a series of conversations and interviews the film asks the question: \"what happens when all we are left with is a photograph?\" It is a reminder of the fragility of art, of nature, and the need to ask ourselves questions. Collodion ends as Overton's son begins to photograph landscapes with an innate sense of wonder and exploration. This is where the heart of the film lies. This is where self-discovery becomes legacy. It is a transformation not of political achievements, or battles won (though they must be fought), but an achievement of what wilderness offers so effortlessly: simplicity, connection, curiosity, and presence.",
