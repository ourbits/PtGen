    "introduction": "After 30 years of failed efforts, Tahel (Rachel at birth) finally persuades her sister Tzipora to leave Abarbanel Psychiatric Hospital and move in with her. Together, the two sisters, challenge and dismantle the language – both verbal and cinematic – until once again it becomes a tool they can use to speak the silence, the oblivion, the dissociation: the black abyss of trauma, what it is they cannot remember and therefore, unable to forget. It is an encounter which takes its participants, if they are willing to join this harrowing journey, back to the starting point; to uncharted, and therefore, terrifying territories of the psyche. A 16-year documentation of a struggle with the existence of a raw traumatic excess which cannot be spoken or mediated verbally.源自：https://www.docaviv.co.il/2023-en/films/tzipora-and-rachel-are-not-dead/",
