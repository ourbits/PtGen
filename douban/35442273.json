They assume the stories of the Berkshire Rabid Dog roaming the county must be true and they are forced to work together if they are to survive the monster. As the night unfolds and they learn more about each other, they soon realize that if the Rabid Dog isn’t the killer then it must be one of them. As each of the strangers try to figure out what happened to the dead woman, their memories begin to return and the true killer emerges.\"",
