    "introduction": "The two brothers Aske (17 years old) and Bastian (12 years old), lives together with their father, Lasse. Their mother died seven years earlier. Everyday they live in a world where fear, violence and alcohol are huge factors, but where the brothers' strong and close relationship means everything. Askes fight for survival means that he have to participate in his fathers sexual needs, which both includes the father abusing Aske, but also paying costumers and the fathers' friend Hans (who has a lot of contacts in the pedophile environment) abusing him. Aske tries everything to keep his little brother out of it all, so that he won't experience the same as himself. But one day Bastian is abused by their father and Aske's entire world is falling apart. The brothers choose to move to Norway, far away in the beautiful mountains. Their friendship outshines everything! They are together and far away from their evil father... Yet one morning everything is turned upside down.",
