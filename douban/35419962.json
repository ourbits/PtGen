    "introduction": "Astonishing musical epic captures the spirit of resistance during the Latvian National Awakening.In 1873, just four years after the first song festival in Estonia and inspired by its success, brave men known as the New Latvians held the first-ever Latvian song festival under the watchful eye of oppressive censorship. This massive celebration, featuring 1,003 singers – both men and women – changed the course of the nation’s history. It stands as a unique example of non-violent resistance in the fight for freedom against imperialism, led by Latvia’s entrepreneurs, writers, publicists and ordinary villagers, including the passionate choirmaster Jurģis (played by the Estonian Priit Pius).",
