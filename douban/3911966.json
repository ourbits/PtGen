    "introduction": "A lovely story of the Guatamalan way of life from the past. An extended family copes with political upheaval. Three boys of the new generation are growing up while three brothers of the one before follow different paths. Several interesting women, especially the wife of one brother and mother of Neto, one of the boys. The unwanted intrusion of outside power and politics is depicted, but not oppressive.Different class levels are shown. Neto accuses the servant girl of being \"just an Indian\". She replies gently they are all Indian. The father's job ends in one upheaval, but he quickly seems to find another. Small hot air balloons are a fad in the family and are interesting. Neto is troubled by asthma, which may be related to his \"silence\".",
