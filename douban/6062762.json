    "introduction": "In the company of an Ifugao shaman, Kidlat Tahimik pays a visit to a Japanese rice farmer who tells them in conversation that he stands before his final harvest, as he is suffering from cancer and the labor is becoming too strenuous for him. From this encounter and the view over the Japanese landscape, Tahimik’s visual associations now run not merely back to his native rice terraces in the Luzon mountains, but also to Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai, in whose title he deciphers a homonym for “some more rice”. From these very disparate threads, he weaves a tribute to rice growing and to those who grow it, dramaturgically released as two letters, one to Takahashi-san, the Japanese rice farmer, and one to Akira Kurosawa.",
