    "introduction": "Fitz is assisting the police in identifying a serial rapist. Floyd Malcom was scarred as a child, both physically and mentally. He now preys on women, often the wives of people he knows. His pattern is always the same: he wears a mask and after raping his victims he chats with them, as if he wants to be their friend. He's also taken to calling in to Fitz's radio talk show for advice. The squad have differing views on how to deal with the rapist and Jimmy Beck in particular is less than sympathetic with the victims. When DS Jane Penhaligon is raped, the police assume it's the same rapist, but Fitz is convinced it's a different man. At home, Fitz finds that his wife Judith has returned and has a bit of a surprise for him. Things become very personal for Fitz when the rapist targets his wife. Penhaligon identifies her attacker and takes matters into her own hands.",
