    "introduction": "Juanita, a loud 35 year old mulata, returns to her homeland to spend Christmas with their loved ones along with 350,000 Dominicans living abroad. She does not come alone, she's accompanied by Mariano, a rough Spanish man much older than her, he's anxious to get to know this island where you can sow 365 days a year. Mariano has decided for the first time in his life to take a risk, he sells his share of the land in Burgo de Osma to a brother and helps Juanita pay for the mortgage of her house in Santo Domingo just when she was about to lose it to the bank. Upon arrival, Juanita confesses she has two children, Mariano confesses in return to have taken advantage of her illegal status in order to get her to stay with him. Amidst these confessions the avalanche of family and friends falls on them, among them is Jairo, the father of her children, a typical 30 year old street wise Dominican who looks at him with jealousy. What Juanita did not confess to Mariano is that she has allowed Jairo to stay at her house to help with the children. Juanita and Mariano, who while being in Spain clung to each other like two castaways to a raft, will try not to drown in Santo Domingo.",
