    "introduction": "After living a clandestine inter-religious relationship with his Hindu partner, circumstances obligate Muslim artist Dorine to return to her family home to another state of India. She is forced to adapt again to a strict discipline ruled by her father, a devout Musilm. One day, she receives an invitation by an art gallery for an individual exhibition in Bombay. She doesn’t share the news with her family as exhibiting her art would be a fact intolerable for her father who does not accept any conduct that deviates from the dictates of the Koran.",
