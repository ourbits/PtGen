    "introduction": "I saw this when it was first released, but I've never seen it since, not even on Turner or AMC. I'd love to know why it sank out of sight. Perhaps because Raf Vallone was virtually unknown in the USA? (Maybe if it had starred Van Heflin, who originated the lead role on Broadway.) I am glad to see a new production of it is underway. With Miller's recent death, maybe it will attract the attention it deserves as Miller's homage to Greek tragedy adapted to the lives of \"ordinary\" working people and to modern stagecraft. After more than 40 years, I finally saw a stage production last night, by the University of Oregon Theater Arts Dept. For a college production it was more than adequate, despite the awful acoustics of their theater. The young actor who played Eddie Carbone was quite good. But it whetted my appetite for a professional production. It's available in VHS on Amazon, but I don't want to buy it, just watch it.",
