    "introduction": "Showing one plot summaryIn 1898, Cassius ('The Cub') Delaney finds himself on an adventure straight out of a dime novel when he's given a try-out as a detective by Chicago's legendary Mahoney & Porter Investigative Agency. Mentored by Constantine Sherro, the agency's best (and worst) agent, the Cub finds himself up against a devious operative from the rival Pinkerton agency, and must choose what sort of a detective he will become. This short film is the fifth part of an 11-part mystery adventure, set between 1895 and 1905, about the mentor/protege relationship between Sherro and the Cub. Their tale, which roves all over the United States, unfolds through three short films interwoven with seven illustrated novels, culminating in a feature film that wraps up the whole adventure.",
