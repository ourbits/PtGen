    "introduction": "The Collector of Anokhapur, Jagatpratap Singh (Dilip Kumar) urges on law and order. However his son Ravi (Sanjay Dutt) believes that sometimes illegal means should be adopted to bring control. This causes discomfort between father and son. Bhushannath 'Dharmendra' Bhadbhole (Kader Khan) is a corrupt Minister of Fisheries. His son Kailash (Gulshan Grover) and Kabza Kanhaiyalal (Anupam Kher) rape and kill Jagatpratap's maid-servant and also kill Ravi's friend. But they are acquitted because of a faked alibi. Ravi decides to put these criminals to punishment which they deserve. But his father's legalism causes problems to him and he decides to leave the home and fight. Ravi for this purpose becomes a police inspector. But this does not heal the father-son bond as he still has different rules of justice. On the statement that the law is for human beings but not for monsters, the father finally manages to join his son in his fight against the corrupt minister.",
