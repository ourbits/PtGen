    "introduction": "Projected on video, Soft Film combines elements of Sara Cwynar’s composite photography and her publications within the traditions of the experimental essay film and performance video. She is interested in how objects circulate via the Internet, in the lives they have now that they could not have lived before. In the film, the artist collects, arranges, and archives her eBay purchases of dated objects according to a logic based upon color, material, vintage, and use.",
