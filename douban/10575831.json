    "introduction": "As fans patiently wait for new episodes of Arrested Development, maybe watching Michael and Gob Bluth talk about body hair will help fill the void. Jason Bateman and Will Arnett not only star in, but are the executive producers of a new documentary called Mansome, directed by Morgan Spurlock. The humorous documentary delves deep into the crevices of male grooming and plucks at how the practice has changed what it means to be a man. Scheduled for release on May 18, the film will have its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival this month and some clips from the film have sprouted online. Hopefully not in a hard to reach area.",
