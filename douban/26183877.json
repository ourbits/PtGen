    "introduction": "Flushing Meadows (1965) is an American short film by Larry Jordan, with director Joseph Cornell. The film is 8 minutes long, in color, 16mm, and silent.The film is an ode to the memory of Joyce Hunter, a Queens waitress Cornell met in 1962. Cornell apparently had an infatuation with Hunter even though she was found to have stolen items and attempted to fence them. Cornell never pressed charges against Hunter and she was murdered in December 1964.",
