    "introduction": "How to wake up a numb people who had everything, who had bought all the dreams that money can buy and knew it had been a bargain? Since its emergence, the car has been one of the greatest symbols and the apotheosis of consumption, synthesizing the contradictions of the machine age. Today a nervous civilization circulates through the tangle of streets, avenues and highways, whose mark is the individual in movement and speed. In this short film, the consequences of this obsession are represented by the anguish, desire and violence of a bored white middle class. The images are the narrative link and suggest temporal, spatial and psychological changes of the characters. PER CAPITA is an audiovisual reflection on the psychological impact of the consumer society on the individual.",
