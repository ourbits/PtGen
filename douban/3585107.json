    "introduction": "This movie is the best. Mostly for kids, I watched it when I was little and I enjoyed it a lot, but I still love it. A great parody of the most popular classic horror films (Dracula, The Werewolf, Frankenstein...), starring the child's music band \"Regaliz\" performing very funny songs. The director is good and the actors manage to make us laugh very often. I keep good memories of this movie and I would love to see it again. I like it because it has very cool songs, it's so funny, exciting, you get a good laugh, and make children laugh at the classical monsters instead of fearing them. Very recommendable, both for children and adults who wants to remember their childhood besides laughing a little.",
