    "introduction": "Jiří Bartoška, charismatic commentator on the world around him, who possessed one of the most fascinating Czech(oslovak) destinies of the past fifty years, was certainly not one for self-admiring glances in the mirror of memories. The president of the Karlovy Vary film festival vigorously rejected all suggestions for a biographical work or film portrait; he was irritated by the pathos associated with official versions of personal life narratives. Thus all the more valuable (and hitherto unseen!) is the bard’s affable, informal exchange with producer Milan Kuchynka, in which he touches upon a myriad themes, from his grammar school days and the Velvet Revolution, to his encounters with stars – and this conveyed with playful ease, blistering irony and affectionate wisdom.",
