    "introduction": "A spy is brought back from cryogenic suspension after being almost killed in a plane crash returning from a mission to learn about a deadly new weapon being developed in the East. But the vital memories are being suppressed, so the authorities use ultra-advanced technologies to try to uncover the secret.\nMasterful performances from Christopher George (as always) and newcomer Greta Baldwin make this William Castle Sci-fi adventure truly exciting, innovative, classic space adventure with a deep message and meaning. Monte Markham adds another polished performance to his long list of superb acting film and TV credits. The film is way ahead of its time 1968 and deserved Oscar recognition. A truly well made, beautifully acted gem. Christopher George one of the greatest 60s/70s tough action leading men gives another epic, dedicated performance that put to shame other so called major stars. To correct some imbecile comments it is the presence and acting ability of stars like Christopher George, Audie Murphy and similar leading action men that make a film watchable and memorable.",
