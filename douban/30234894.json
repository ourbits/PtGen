    "introduction": "\"The Baltic Tribes\" is a story about the last pagans of Europe. Together with the main character, Danish spy Lars, you will experience the 13th century pagan life, taking part in religious rites and cruel forays, getting high during the summer solstice, becoming the slave of Cours and finally - fighting the crusaders in the Battle of Saule. The docudrama overthrows the myths of the Baltic people as just peaceful farmers, and questions, how little we know about the blood that runs in our veins.",
