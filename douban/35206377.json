    "introduction": "Our film is set in the 21st century where the idea of and possibility of realizing our dreams is considered a central part of Western culture. This idea is largely unrealistic and creates a dissatisfaction that we can only describe as culturally motivated. We see this as a sort of universally amusing, lonely struggle with one’s own evolution, a humorous tragedy of our own making. The film should remain ‘realistic’ and ‘matter of fact’ throughout whilst focusing on the slight absurdity of the everyday to create a strangeness. The obtuse dialogue will be used as a tool for humorous misunderstandings and frustrations. These communicative fumblings are at best wonderfully funny and at worst confusingly painful but almost always universally understood.",
