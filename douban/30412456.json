    "introduction": "A movie based on Transgenders, the 'in-betweens' that are shunned by society, unaccepted and forced to make ends meet through sex work. The film, revolves around the lives of three transgenders, their work, their difficulties, their childhood, their relationships, their hobbies, their normality. The film captures small to larger than life movements in their lives, giving us a peak into their world. This is not only a story of the dark and difficult life of the transgenders, but also of their beautiful journeys filled with psychedelic and vibrant colours of the 'vibgyor' that will engross us and captivate us till we are all hit by one question, how can such beautiful, flamboyant people be denied basic human rights and be victims of todays democracy?",
