    "introduction": "Ori, a young IDF soldier critically injured during a Gaza military operation, clings to life while his family maintains a bedside vigil. Director Sharon Bar-Ziv stars in this intimate chamber ensemble, playing anxious father David, whom together with his wife Naomi, rarely leave Ori's side, praying and watching for any sign of improvement. During the long wait, family, friends, doctors and therapists struggle to temper expectations and cope with the strain of the situation that sees moments of heartbreak, humor and hope. This beautifully rendered story of human resilience offers insight into the ordeal faced by military families in Israel and throughout the world.",
