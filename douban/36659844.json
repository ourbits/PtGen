    "introduction": "The Gauntlet II is the 11th season of the MTV reality game show, The Challenge. The season is directly subsequent to The Inferno II.The Gauntlet II marked T. J. Lavin's first time presenting the series, regularly hosting the program from this season forward. Prior seasons only used temporary hosts. The season is the second in the Gauntlet series, with the original Gauntlet airing in 2003–2004 and The Gauntlet III following in 2008.The Gauntlet II aired in late 2005 and into 2006 with 32 contestants and took place in Trinidad and Tobago. The teams were designated Veterans and Rookies, based on the number of prior Challenge seasons on which each cast member had competed. Those on the Veterans team had been on at least two prior seasons, and those on the Rookies team had been on fewer than two seasons. For this season, a male and female captain were determined at the beginning of the season. After each team challenge, the losing team captain was sent to the \"Gauntlet\", where they would face an opponent of the same sex and same team who was voted into the Gauntlet by the respective team. Gauntlets alternated between \"Male Gauntlets\" and \"Female Gauntlets\".",
