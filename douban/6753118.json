    "introduction": "Yann, a cook, and Nadia, a waitress and mother of 9-year-old boy, decide to risk everything on the purchase of a restaurant. With plenty of talent, energy, love and dreams, but no finance of their own, they find themselves pushed into a jungle of financing and bank loans that quickly overwhelms them. To bail them out, Nadia has to take a job in Canada, while Yann is forced to stay behind to save the restaurant. Together, he and the boy confront a relentless avalanche of creditors, an uncaring system and the daily grind from which there is no respite…From Paris to Saint-Denis, from Sables d’Olonne to Canada, the film describes the relentless social meltdown of Yann, a young cook, and his girlfriend, Nadia who become caught in a downward spiral of over indebtedness. Motivated by a deep sense of urgency within the current economic context, Cédric Kahn confirms his strength as a director and his ability to elicit breathtaking performances from actors.",
