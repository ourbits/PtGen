    "introduction": "Lee Mack’s multi-award-winning show, the longest running sitcom on air, returns with a new Christmas special as the comedy series hits 100 episodes, joining an elite group of sitcom centenarians.Brace for yuletide suburban chaos courtesy of Lee (Lee Mack) and Lucy (Sally Bretton) as Lee throws everything at creating the perfect family Christmas, agreeing to Lucy's wishes to do something charitable and having “a normal Christmas where nothing goes wrong.” This moment of festive spirit sees the couple invite Wilfred, a lonely pensioner from the nearby care home, to join them for Christmas dinner. The only instruction is that Wilfred is not, under any circumstances, allowed to drink alcohol…Given best friends Toby (Hugh Dennis) and uptight ice-queen Anna (Abigail Cruttenden) are on hand, as well as Lucy’s lovely mum Wendy (Deborah Grant) with curmudgeonly dad Geoffrey (Geoffrey Whitehead), surely Lee can ensure this Christmas runs to plan?",
