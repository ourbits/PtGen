Demers is an award-winning stand-up comedian who's made notable appearances on CONAN and AMERICA'S GOT TALENT. In 2018, his album Indistinct Chatter was nominated for a JUNO Award for Best Comedy Album and in 2015 Demers received Best Breakout Artist at the Canadian Comedy Awards. Demers has been recognized at the 2014 Montréal Just For Laughs Comedy Festival, 2013 Toronto Comedy Brawl, and as a 2011 finalist on NBC's Stand-Up.",
