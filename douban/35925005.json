    "introduction": "Analogue film magician Ben Russell turns time against itself in a beautiful experiment with diaristic elements from his new life in southern Europe.How difficult it is to find a suitable image for something as immediate as the passage of time. That it is easier to put images to the almost unnatural ambition of turning the passing of time against itself is one of the unexpected points of Ben Russell’s dialogue-free ‘Against Time’, which lets the dream come true with the intervention of an analogue film camera. A work that may be abstract even by Russell’s own standards, but is nonetheless easy to let yourself get carried away by. The double CPH:DOX award winner’s new work incorporates diary elements from the creator’s new life in Europe. A child’s face lights up the screen in a poignant double exposure during a trip through a traffic tunnel at night. Please note: The film contains strobe-like effects.",
