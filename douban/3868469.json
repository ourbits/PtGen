    "introduction": "With an international cast and Deodato directing this 1967 superhero film it can't possibly go wrong, but it did! The superhero is a laughing dude with wool stocking over his head (I don't know how he could see-thru with a holeless mask!). He laughs like Diabolik, and on the video box, he looks like Superargo, but in reality he comes off as a cat burglar! Bulk of the film consist of not our crime fighter but rather the thieves double crossing each other and killing each other over some king tut mask then our hero solving the crime. Fenomenal appears in the beginning scene (pre credit) battle some drug runners, as that really grabbed my attention more than DIABOLIK's pre-credit sequence, only for him to not appear for more than 30 minutes!! The movie runs so slow that it almost put me to sleep. Catchy pop tune helps, but the fight sequence is lame (save for the pre-credit fight scene). One of the worst ending you'll ever see in a 60's retro-italian film. Look for the late action star Maruzio Melli in a small part. Not recommeneded. Very disapponted.",
