With interviews with such artists as Cildo Meireles, Amir Haddad and Regina Casé, the documentary recounts Frederico's trajectory from his arrival in Rio in 1965 to his fundamental role in organizing the Sundays of Creation, while shedding light on his views on the relation between artists and critics.",
