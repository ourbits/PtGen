    "introduction": "A man (Christos Stergioglou) driving an old-fashioned car is crossing the border. He is Greek and past his fifties. He is coming to Bulgaria to buy a child. The price is ten thousand Eur. To smuggle the child Jorgos has prepared a secret compartment in the boot of the car masked as a gas tank. The baby hasn't been born yet and the Greek needs to wait in a secluded house in the mountains together with the mother (Mariana Zhikich), her deaf-mute brother (Ovanes Torosyan) and the midwife. The birth starts during a stormy night.",
