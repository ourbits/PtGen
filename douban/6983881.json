She strongly believes that it wasn't a dream.Director’s Statement:While I was in Japan for researching an Japanese avant-garde film last year I received the saddest phone call from my mother who told me that my father, who had been sick from liver cancer, had passed away peacefully. A few days before he died, I talked to him on the phone and he said, “I want my ashes to be scattered in the forest.”  I replied to him with my tear flows “You will be alright.”I didn’t even go back for his funeral. I began shooting this film which I had only an image of ashes and a forest, hoping that this film can cure me of my pain.",
