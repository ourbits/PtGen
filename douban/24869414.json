    "introduction": "When England cricketer Kenneth Waring dies of asphyxiation after a fire is set at a friend's house, the police have no doubt they are dealing with murder. The house belonged to Waring's patron and close friend Miriam Whitelaw who had a visitor the evening Waring died, her estranged daughter Olivia. Waring was separated from his wife Jeannie and had recently given her divorce papers. As well, his lover and agent Gabriella Patten, the ex-wife of a cricket teammate, has gone missing. Miriam had recently been attacked by animal rights activists which, unbeknown to her, included her daughter. When Waring's son confesses to the murder, Lynley has his doubts. Lynley decides they need a profiler on the case and not surprisingly hires Helen Clyde for the job but things don't go very well. Havers moves into her new flat.",
