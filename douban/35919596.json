    "introduction": "This fiction feature, currently in development, is being produced by Eszter Kozma and Viktória Petrányi for Budapest-based Proton Cinema. The movie is based on the real life of Otto Herman (1835-1914), a prominent Hungarian nature scientist recognised as a pioneer of Hungarian natural history research, who slowly lost his sense of hearing. Seeking a path from solitude to acknowledgement, he ultimately becomes part of nature and comes to terms with his own disability. We follow his life from his thirties to his mid-fifties, as well as the important bonds he develops with two women. The film’s artistic approach has been described by the team as “based on silent observation, with nature-documentary elements and shot in original habitats”.",
