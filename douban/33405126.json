    "introduction": "The History of dispersed families. 'Finding Dispersed Families\"-Find my family - Looking for long lost father, mother, brother and sister. The Korean War broke out on June 25, 1950. Consequently, families living in the South and North were torn apart. The Korean War resulted in four million casualties and 100,000 war orphans; ten million people were separated from their families. The war which neither camp did not win, ended in a truce in 1953. And now it still remains divided between the South and the North, and a only one divided country in the world. In 2015, the first generation of separated families who now have around 70,000 people are being lived here as ever. And they still hope to reunion their families continuously. Currently total of separated families included the 2nd and the 3rd generation of separated families in South Korea are 10 million peoples. (3rd generation of separated families are North Korean defectors/refugees.) Being divided for seventy years, this is a tragic story for all of us as ever.",
