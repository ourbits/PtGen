    "introduction": "透過聆聽香港舞蹈團團員的自述，凝視他們在排練室與劇場的日常，試圖重構他們如何通過持續的武術訓練，與舞團一同經歷藝術方向與訓練方式的革新。影片同時紀錄了他們在過程中的不安、思索與發現，他們閉著眼睛，在一條未知的道路上慢慢前行。This sublime documentary captures the reform initiatives of one of the most established dance companies in Hong Kong. The company has set sail to re-evaluate its artistic essence by adopting a new philosophy. It also wants to integrate new physical disciplines, by picking up different cultural traces, meditation and Chinese martial arts. Tag along on this uncertain journey, as company members unveil their fear, their self-questioning and their findings in the quest of refining their dance forms and carrying out training to embody their cultural roots.",
