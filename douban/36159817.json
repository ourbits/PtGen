    "introduction": "Îκαρος (Icarus) is the first medium-length film by artist Giorgio Andreotta Calò. Set inside the former Butterfly Pavilion of the Rensenpark in Emmen (Netherlands), the work stages a symbolic act that precedes the building's demolition in 2021. For the last time, the structure is inhabited by a huge colony of moths. Based on Ovid's myth of Daedalus and Icarus, the film triggers an extensive metamorphosis of symbols, places and protagonists. Dedalus is Enzo Moretto, an expert entomologist. Icarus is Bart Coppens, a young YouTuber and self-taught entomologist. Between documentary and performance, the film follows the rhythm of day and night: the shots of the study and scientific observation of these insects are intertwined with a dreamlike vision suspended between reality and mythical narration.",
