    "introduction": "The 30-minute documentary \"Gerhard Richter. Das Kölner Domfenster\" (2007) by Corinna Belz offers insight into the complex decision-making and production processes involved in making the new window for the south transept of Cologne cathedral. The author followed Gerhard Richter and the progress of the work for over two years. The film shows the numerous developmental steps that lead from the initial idea of a field of colour, both simple and convincing, to how the work ultimately turned out.",
