    "introduction": "In Carcará, Pega, Mata e Come (1970-1982), a poor northeastern family, while walking in the sertão, is confronted by a diabolical bird. The bird transforms into Captain America and looms over them. A young boy, taking on the figure of David vs. Goliath, fights Captain America.This pioneering animation, considered to be the first to be made in Piauí, is an allegory about the imposition of North-American culture in Brazil and the popular resistance against it.",
