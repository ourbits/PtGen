    "introduction": "A widower of 40 years lives with his son of ten, but the roles seem reversed, because the child is more mature than his father. In this comedy-melodrama, Nestor (Hector Alterio) is an inept romantic who is blessed with the best son a father could have, young Sebastian (Adrian Ferrario). The contrast between father and son forms the pivot around which the story and the comedy revolve. Serious moments are introduced when Sebastian becomes gravely ill thanks to his bumbling father and when Nestor manages to win the heart of Sebastian's attractive teacher",
