    "introduction": "How many strangers can squeeze into a car? When they truly share the journey, no matter how tightly packed inside a moving vehicle, those within cease to be strangers, as one of New German Cinema's most refined and perceptive voices suggests. Five individuals, hailing from diverse national backgrounds but united by a common geographic destination, embark on a journey across the heart of Europe, following the highway that links Berlin to Paris. Even as the horizon stretches wide and the car seats feel cramped, they will discover what it means to find their way through obstacles – if not due to them – during this unique journey that serves as a metaphor for the significance of coexistence in times of crisis. A film brimming with affection for the future of Europe, celebrating the Old Continent's reawakening to the importance of emotional connection.源自：https://www.filmfestival.gr/en/section-tiff/movie/1302/15205",
