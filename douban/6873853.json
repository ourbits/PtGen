    "introduction": "Barlowe Mann introduces troubled pre-teen, Oliver Henry (Nathan Gamble), whose belief system has been shattered by a family tragedy. Torn between religion and science, he seeks solace from Barlowe Mann (Lloyd Warner), a strangely dressed loner who reads fanciful stories to elementary school students in an abandoned small town hockey rink. The Sheriff (Watrson-Johnson) is suspicious of Barlowe, as are most of the parents, but Oliver believes in his spiritual powers and the positive effects his stories are having on a group of fellow students.And a positive message is what Oliver needs, considering that his parents (Corbin Bernsen and Dendrie Taylor) have never resolved the unexplained disappearance and apparent death of their first son. Trapped in a desperate household where his parents barely communicate, Oliver has to figure out a way to move forward. Barlowe Mann has those answers.",
