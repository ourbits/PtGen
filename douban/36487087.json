    "introduction": "Was the spirit of competition, the urge to go head-to-head, the sole reserve of men in the mid-20th Century? In the 1950s and 60s, two women joined the fray ! Two women with a shared name: Jacqueline. One passion: aviation. One goal: to become the world's fastest woman.The American Jacqueline Cochran became the first woman to break the sound barrier at the controls of a Sabre F-86. But her record was soon snatched by Jacqueline Auriol, the daughter-in-law of the French president, who became the first European woman to break the sound barrier, and went on to become France's first woman test pilot.Using state-of-the-art CGI imagery to recreate their flying feats, this documentary retraces the history of these daring record attempts in the post-war period, with each triumph bringing prestige to their respective countries.Their extraordinary supersonic duel lasted 15 years, and saw both Jacquelines write their names in aviation history.Production : Indigènes Productionhttps://www.zed.fr/en/catalog/supersonic-women-a-duel-in-the-sky",
