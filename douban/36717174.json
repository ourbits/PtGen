    "introduction": "To follow a new trend initiated by American advertisers, female director Margaux B. launches a casting call to find women who speak, with the collaboration of casting director Alexis M. The first actresses coming in for the casting react roughly to the idea. Some of them are even shocked and refuse to say anything. Progressively though, as they are totally free to say anything they want for once, women start revealing themselves with their own words. As Margaux Bonhomme is very pleased with the gallery of portraits they're compiling, the casting director wonders what they will sell with this material.",
