    "introduction": "Aleksey Vyazintsev learns that several books by the forgotten Soviet writer Gromov have magical properties. Each of these books gives a specific effect: Rage, Patience, Power, Joy, Strength, Memory. Various groups of readers fight fiercely for them, forming a secret network of Libraries with their own code, rules and goals. Impoverished doctors and engineers, former convicts and cops, forgotten athletes, journalists who did not fit into the tone of the era - they all found a new meaning in Gromov's books and are ready to die for them. Vyazintsev will have to search for the most important book - the book of Meaning.",
