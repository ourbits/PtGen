    "introduction": "The main character of Estonia's first mystical TV documentary is Dr. Ivo Kolts, a lecturer at the University of Tartu who lives in Häädemees. In addition to his work at the university, he treats patients with joint diseases and wheelchair users. In the spring of 2010, Dr. Kolts had a strange dream. The next evening, the man noticed strange lights in Häädemeeeste Bay. A half-year-long photo session began, as a result of which Ivo Kolts is convinced that he managed to capture phenomena of extraterrestrial origin. The heart-wrenching photos and videos are complemented by the Norwegian Anita, who came to Pärnu for a spa vacation for the first time three years ago. According to an elderly woman, angels have repeatedly taken her to an unknown place on a mystical mothership, where she has met her late mother. Anita will move to Häädemeeste in the near future, because she recognized this place next to the church here. The author of the film is Urmas E. Liiv.",
