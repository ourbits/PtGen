    "introduction": "Sita Valles was born in Angola, in 1951, but studied Medicine in Lisbon, where she became a communist student leader. After 1974, and because she considered that the revolution in Portugal had no future, she left for Angola and joined the MPLA, the liberation movement. Sita died at the age of 26, in 1977, in circumstances which have not been fully clarified. Testimonies of political figures who crossed paths with her tell us about her life.源自：https://indielisboa.com/en/film/sita-the-life-and-times-of-sita-valles/",
