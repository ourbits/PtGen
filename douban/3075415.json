    "introduction": "Taking a break from a recording session, Frank Sinatra comes across a group of ten boys out to lynch an eleventh.  He finally gets it out of them that the lynching is because they don't like his \"religion\" (he's Jewish).  Frank tries to impress upon the boys that such attitude is the way the Nazis think.  Regardless of religion, they all are Americans, whose families not only helped defeat the Nazis in the war, but helped their fellow soldiers survive.  He tells them a story following the bombing at Pearl Harbor where a successful American attack on an enemy warship was carried out by a Christian and a Jew.  He then uses the song \"The House I Live In\" to show what it is to live with freedoms in multi-cultural America.",
