    "introduction": "The best comedies are crafted from the elements of tragedy, and that's something Oregon knows well. Filmed with a nostalgic and tender vintage aesthetic, Kerem Ayan’s film whisks the audience away to Istanbul on a summer day in 1985. It is a time when a young couple finds themselves arrested and imprisoned for a trivial reason – a mere cassette tape. In light of this unfortunate incident, as the couple rallies friends and acquaintances to secure their release and a multitude of eccentric characters swarm in and out of the police station, the film unfolds. With a blend of humor and nuanced social commentary, it paints a panorama of Turkish society in the 1980s while also offering insightful observations on the present day. With an all-star ensemble cast who are clearly having as much fun as the audience, Oregon is nothing less than a collective portrait of a society and a country.源自：https://www.filmfestival.gr/en/section-tiff/movie/1302/15165",
