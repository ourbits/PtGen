    "introduction": "PORTRAIT - It was Clint Eastwood, with his trademark brevity, that best defines what Pierre Rissient is in the cinema world: \"Mr Everywhere.\" After all, Eastwood, the last giant of Hollywood classics, knows he's had a debt to this unclassifiable yet essential international figure for the last sixty years. It was the Frenchman, incidentally, who worked to tear off the \"cowboy/tough cop\" label, allowing Eastwood's directorial talents shine through, celebrated with the very first Lumière Award in 2009.",
