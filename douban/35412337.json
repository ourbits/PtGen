    "introduction": "Audrey Benac (Deragh Campbell) lives alone in Paris after having moved there to tend to the home of her recently deceased friend, Juliane. She struggles to find her footing in the world, moving through the days without any clear motivation or sense of purpose.  Audrey forges a correspondence with two male filmmakers —Burak, who lives in Istanbul, and Blake, who lives in Toronto—and entertains their efforts to help her get through this sorrowful and directionless time.A Woman Escapes is a fusion in every sense, combining various shooting formats (16mm, 3D, & 2K), genres (diary film, video correspondence, psychodrama, & essay film), shooting locations (France, Turkey, & Canada), and each director’s distinct creative sensibility. Through its dynamic, hyper-hybridized structure and workflow, the film explores our collective curiosities about isolation, grief, spirituality, contemporary means of communication, and the increasingly variegated nature of the modern world.",
