    "introduction": "Beach is a recreation of a live performance originally presented at Mercer Union in Toronto in June 2018. An expanded prologue for the film Chooka, the performance used a live feed from an iPhone to project images taken while making the film, as well as material from Jacques Madvo’s archive, the original spark for the creation of the work. Paired with writing that was swapped back and forth between the artists, the work meditates on the politics of an archive, the shifting agency of different bodies in a landscape, and the challenge of asking what a complete image could be.",
