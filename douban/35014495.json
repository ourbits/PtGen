    "introduction": "Mis 500 Locos is an emotional story that evokes the black cinema of the fifties and takes place during the cruel dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas Trujillo. After a group of mental patients escape from the Nigüa Psychiatric Hospital, Dr. Antonio Zaglul is appointed new director of the institution in order to calm the negative press that the lack of control of the place was generating. Once there it will be difficult to tell if the madness lives inside or outside the hospital walls.",
