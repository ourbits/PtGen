    "introduction": "Mark is serving a prison sentence of several years. The only ray of light in his otherwise dull routine is the possibility of seeing his girlfriend Jessica again. The night before Mark is granted prison leave, his older cellmate, Boxer, gives him the last of his savings, extracting a promise from Mark to hand the money to his daughter. Mark agrees. But in fact his act of friendship only leads Mark back down the road he thought he had put behind him. The more the story progresses, the more the film turns into the portrait of a convict whose brief spell of freedom breaks him.",
