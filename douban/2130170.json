    "introduction": "In Natural Born Killers, Woody Harrelson played a mass murderer on a road trip killing spree. In Go Further, Harrelson has returned to the road, this time as himself, and this time he’s out to save the earth. The film documents a trip down the Pacific coast Harrelson and assorted friends took in the summer of 2001 in a bio-diesel and hemp oil-fueled bus. Along the way they tackled various stretches by bike, did a lot of yoga, spoke in front of college crowds about environmental awareness, ate avocado-based delicacies prepared by the on-board raw foods chef, and encountered rock stars like Bob Weir, Natalie Merchant, and Anthony Kiedis. Your run of the mill road trip, in other words. Harrelson’s buddy, the junk food addict Steve Clark emerges as the star, if stardom means the ability to expound on the evils of non-organic milk at length. Herein lies the conundrum. For all its earnestness, or maybe because of it, Go Further drags. It’s a movie with its heart in the right place, but that seems unwilling to preach to anyone outside the choir. The best bits are those in which Harrelson and the crew encounter folks who don't share their point of view--inhalant-addicted teens in Oregon, small town folks who sneeringly refer to Harrelson as \"Woody Allen.\" Opportunities for confrontation are eschewed lest anyone's vibe gets harshed. One almost wishes Michael Moore had been hitchhiking along US Route 1 that summer. --Ryan Boudinot",
