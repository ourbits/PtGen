    "introduction": "After getting into a fight with her ex-boyfriend, Aimee gets into a car accident with her high school English teacher, Anthony. Anthony offers her a place to stay after noticing that she lives in her car. Anthony's follows the rest of the day that they spend together, while comparing both of their obsessive personalities and tumultuous lives. It deals with awkwardness between old \"friends\" and the taboos of being intimately alone with someone you may remember but don't actually know, while also exploring how technology can enable obsessive behavior.",
