    "introduction": "The best thing about KATTEN MONS is the incredibly cool claymation art. The story itself of a very, very hungry cat that eats anything and everything is only okay, but it doesn't matter too much since the film is more like a piece of art than a traditional film. As for the clay, the story is told using two-dimensional ableaux that morph and change before your eyes. It's all rather hypnotic and cool and is well worth seeing.",
