    "introduction": "It is autumn. There is one last colourful leaf hanging at the end of a long branch. The little black bird would like to water it, but the squirrel snatches away the watering can and begins hopping with it from tree to tree. The little bird follows the cheeky thief but then the fiery red fox comes stalking. He is not interested in the watering can. He wants the bird and the squirrel. Good job they can hide beneath the colourful autumn leaves. And good thing too that you can play trumpet on a watering can. How nice it is when a pair having a row become friends after all.",
