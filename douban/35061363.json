    "introduction": "THE AFTERGLOW weaves a tale of obsession, its denial and eventual acceptance, where the ghosts of the past refuse to be ignored any longer. Oliver Price is a successful writer whose personal life was marked by a sinister childhood encounter: his sexual awakening at the hands of a dead girl. Since then, Oliver has stubbornly clung to an obsession with finding a dark, almost supernatural relationship. One day Oliver believes he has found what he is seeking in his dead brother's girlfriend, an enigmatic girl who seeks refuge by his side as she tries to recover her memories, destroyed in an apparent suicide attempt. The relationship between Oliver and Laura darkens with obsession and by a strange nature which threatens to destroy them both.",
