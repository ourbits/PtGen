    "introduction": "A twisted tale of broken legs, painkillers and phone sex that explores the dark heart of transactional relationships – and the sick thrill of a scam.Lost in a fog of medication as she recovers from a broken leg, romance-obsessed loner Sally gets swept up in a long-distance relationship with the seductively mysterious Richard, who soon starts asking for money to pay for his mother’s ‘medical bills’. But when Sally plays along, it’s a case of who’s scamming whom – and to what twisted end? Inspired by the short stories of Ottessa Moshfegh and Mary Gaitskill, and shooting on 35mm to evoke the likes of Repulsion and Last Tango in Paris, directors Lucy McKendrick and Charles Polinger deliver a stylish, morally ambiguous psychodrama that relishes in the thrill of a fraught, fraudulent sexual tryst.源自：https://miff.com.au/program/film/fuck-me-richard",
