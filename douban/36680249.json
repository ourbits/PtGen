    "introduction": "With 6,700 km of rivers, canals and rivers, France has the largest area of waterways in Europe. Formerly reserved for the transport of goods, the canals are today places of vacation: we spend the holidays there on boats without a license, we cycle there, walk there, we open taverns and guest rooms there . River tourism is revitalizing sometimes forgotten territories. For the general public, it is green tourism. But the reality is not so idyllic. Discharge of wastewater into canals, aging diesel engines, diesel or oil leaks: the sources of pollution are numerous. So, to establish itself as the flagship of slow tourism and attract new customers, river tourism must reinvent itself",
