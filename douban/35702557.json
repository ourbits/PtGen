    "introduction": "Presented in the same week at World AIDS Day (December 1), this program aims to sell the safe sex message to young people in a frank and humorous way, using language that is straightforward, without preaching. Fully scripted by comedy screenwriter Morris Gleitzman, it features a cast of actors headed by John Doyle, better known as Rampaging Roy Slaven, in the role of a probing current affairs reporter investigating Sex. He interviews young people at the pub, on the beach, at work, in the street, at school, in the carpark, and in bed. His aim is to put contemporary relationships under the microscope, to seek out safe sex, and to explode the myths and reveal the truth about AIDS. He is particularly concerned with a dangerously careless sexual exponent, Russell (Ashley Paske), who refuses to wear a condom.",
