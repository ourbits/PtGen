    "introduction": "In the margins of a dystopian Buenos Aires where police brutality reigns and people set up barricades on the streets, rap battles are the rage. In the neighborhood, confrontations between rival gangs are sometimes resolved through rimes –other times they use, with weapons. Panash (played by a magnetic Real Valessa) is the queen of flow –both she and her revolutionary spirit break people’s hearts. This includes her well-respected friend Ciro (Homer el Mero Mero), who doesn’t have the courage to tell her how he feels. Things start getting more and more complicated when Panash lays her eyes on the new kid Isi (Lautaro LR) and violence escalates in the city. With a cast filled with Argentine hip-hop stars, Christoph Behl shapes an authentic urban musical that captures a movement that is now in its peak, with a strength that goes beyond the boundaries of fiction.",
