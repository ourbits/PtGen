    "introduction": "For 11-year-old Tino, being the eldest of five children in a Samoan family is no easy task. Tino plays guardian and protector to his yo unger siblings. As Tino strives to cope in an adult world, the birth of yet another baby brings about more burdens and responsibilities. The children endure in silence, their world a weave of vision and sound.Written by 德国奥伯豪森国际短片电影节[Kurzfilmtage - international short film festival Oberhausen (http://www.imdb.com/search/title?plot_author=Kurzfilmtage%20-%20international%20short%20film%20festival%20Oberhausen&amp;view=simple&sort=alpha)]",
