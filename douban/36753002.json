    "introduction": "Released in March 2023, Toy follows the adventures of a floppy-eared inventor of the same name, who also happens to be, you guessed it, a toy! He has two friends (at least two friends!), an ever-hungry crocodile and a skillful human girl, who help him defend the small town of Rockledge against the machinations of evil kitty-cat CEO, Lily Buttercup. Jealous of Toy’s inventing abilities, Lily will do anything to show him up — even build a ginormous mech-suit so she can personally destroy his hometown!",
