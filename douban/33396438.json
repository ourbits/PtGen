    "introduction": "THE SEER AND THE UNSEEN is a magically real fable about invisible elves, financial collapse and the surprising power of belief, told through the story of an Icelandic woman - a real life Lorax who speaks on behalf of nature under threat. Through her heroic story, SEER explores the surprising power of belief, the profound meaning of home; and, the invisible forces - be they elves or the market - that shape our visible worlds and transform our natural landscapes",
