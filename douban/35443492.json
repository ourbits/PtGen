    "introduction": "They say marriages are made in heaven, but sometimes on planet Earth, you need a little help to find your ideal match. A young and good looking Ricky Malhotra is on the lookout for his \"perfect bride\". He is introduced to 5 beautiful prospects, but each of these firebrands pose a unique quirk that society stereotypically perceives to be an imperfection. Hairy, bald, foul-mouthed, overweight and a divorcee - together they are the Aafat that Ricky is greeted with. This drama is a hilarious yet thought-provoking take on arranged marriages and what society perceives to be \"perfect bride\" material.",
