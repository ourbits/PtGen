    "introduction": "Le Messager was the fourth directorial effort for prominent Gallic actor Raymond Rouleau. Adapted from a play by Henry Bernstein, the story comes to life when wealthy Englishwoman Betty Rowe is deserted by her French husband Jean Gabin in favor of his secretary Gaby Morlay. In \"hell hath no fury\" fashion, Rowe uses her influence to ruin Gabin financially. He is forced to flee to Africa, leaving Morlay behind in Paris. Setting up a prosperous business concern, Gabin goes into partnership with handsome Jean-Pierre Aumont. Waxing rhapsodic about his new wife Morlay, Gabin unwittingly causes Aumont to fall in love with her, sight unseen. And then, he does see her, leaving the luckless Gabin in the lurch once more. A tragic plot twist enables Gabin to stage a reunion with Morlay, though at least one of them is not too happy about it.",
