    "introduction": "After his psychotic ex disappears, Sidney, a bisexual dive bar drag queen, is forced to look after his 11-year-old son Georgie. Sidney is stuck in a glam rock-informed state of arrested development, still harboring aspirations of becoming a successful musician, a dream put on hold to ensure Georgie has what he needs, including the unconditional love of his father. Hunky Dory is a tale of unconventional fatherhood, the fear of mediocrity, and the pulsing reality of dreams deferred. It’s an oddball but legitimate take on the modern dysfunctional family.",
