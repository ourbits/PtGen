    "introduction": "\"We literally found our film next to a garbage bin. It was a bag with 36 rolls of photo negatives exposed between the 1960s and 1980s by an unknown photographer. We named him Anton, the son of Aunt Emma. Looking through his contact sheets, with many imperfections: indistinct sharpness, random elements in the frame, light leaks, accidents, double exposures, etc, we tried to imagine what our lives would be like if these were our photos\".",
