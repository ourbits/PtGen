    "introduction": "The Bear That Wasn't was the title of the first picture book by Frank Tashlin, the greatest director of Hollywood film comedy. Bear was published in 1946 when Tashlin was writing scripts for CBS radio and, in the following six years, Tashlin wrote and published three more similar pieces, The Possum that Didn't, The World that Isn't and The Turtle That Couldn't. Tashlin, like Aesop before him, intended these to be humourous, witty and engaging moral fables.Sadly, Tashlin never filmed nor republished any of his four picture books. However, two Dutch film-makers have bravely tried to translate something of Tachlin's ironic satire onto film. The hero of Bear wakes up from hibernation to find that a factory has been built around the mouth of his cave. When he emerges, no one will believe that he is really a bear - for example, the foreman of the factory thinks he is a worker in a fur coat. The bear gives up arguing and agrees to be a man. But that is not the end of the story....",
