    "introduction": "August 8, 2016: Luis Eduardo Aute suffers a heart attack who sends him to a hospital. After two months in a comma fearing for his life and with a long recover ahead, his son Miki proposes the idea to pay tribute his father with a documentary to talk about the man who born in September 13, 1943 in Manila, Filippines, during the World War II, in the days when the island was bombed by the USA's Army. Moved to Spain in 1951 at 8, Luis Eduardo is a quiet child and bad student but with excellent class notes in drawing, turning it in his passion that opening his first expo art at 16 in 1967. With General Franco's dictatorship governing Spain, Aute starts a carrier as songwriter for another singers as Massiel and Rosa León, causing that eventually himself, forced by music companies, turns in singer at late 60s. His paused and relaxed style to sing and the letters of his songs between poetic and cryptic turns Aute in the first protest-singer in Spain and a generational icon as pioneer of the protest-song, surpassing frontiers to be one of the most famous singers too in Latinoamerica's countries as Ecuador, Cuba and Argentina. Retiring in 1968 disappointed by the way to make music at those times, Aute returns in 1973 to turn in a symbol of freedom for Spain specially after General Franco's death in 1975. In the next years during La Transición Española (The Spanish Transition) from dictatorship to democracy in the reign of King Juan Carlos I, praised as one of the best Spain's singers and an avant-garde, Aute lives his best and most productive times as full-time singer and artist not only in the 70s but the La Movida Española (The Madrilenian Scene) in the 80s and later 90s, creating with his voice a personal style in unforgettable songs, in addition with a great art legacy that it includes books, poems, original soundtracks for movies, movies directed by himself and pictures with women, eroticism and the holy side of sex as main theme. A prolific carrier to culminate with Ánimo Animal, a tribute live concert made on December 10, 2018 with 15,000 assistants where Aute with veteran friends and partners as Joaquín Sabina, Joan Manuel Serrat, Ana Belén as well as younger singers as Rozalén, Dani Martín and Marwan celebrate the life and the personal universe of a friendly man with a tireless passion to create. Using unreleased photos and videos, interviews to his friends and job partners and archive footage, Aute Retrato is a deep look of an one-off artist capable to live as he always wanted: being himself.",
