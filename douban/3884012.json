    "introduction": "This highly symbolic and enigmatic political drama by Hungarian director Miklos Jancso was produced by a consortium from Italy, France and West Germany. This film is considered to be an homage to Antonioni as it uses his favorite leading actress (Monica Vitti) and his cameraman Carlo di Palma. This film was made at a time when Jancso was not allowed to make films in his native Hungary. While covering an Italian political protest, a journalist played by Vitti, finds herself surrounded by a group of young men who jostle her, remove her recording equipment and set fire to her car. She goes to the police but when they bring one of the assailants before her to identify, she lies and says that he is not one of the attackers. This leads to her having a romantic relationship with this mysterious young man-- an Italian neo-fascist who has been given the job of assassinating a leftist.",
