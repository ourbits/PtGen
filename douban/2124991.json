    "introduction": "Years ago, Marlene left her husband Leonhard, a serious, strait-laced district judge, and became the lover of Leonhard's best friend Jan. It has taken a long time for the wounds to heal, but the trio has succeeded in restoring its friendship, even if it is more tenuous than in the past...Then Anja enters their lives, a darkly beautiful, mysterious young student. Leonhard, in particular, is fascinated by her and showers her with his attentions. Flattered, Anja develops a tender affection for Leonhard and, when he proposes to her, she accepts. They marry and have a child, Daniel. The two couples begin seeing each other regularly, even vacationing together, but Leonard soon returns to his neat, well-ordered, predictable life...Anja grows increasingly apathetic when it becomes clear to her that Leonhard will never give her the love she yearns for. An accident in which little Daniel is severely injured begins to push Anja closer to the edge. Alcohol looms large in her life, but not as large as her unquenchable longing for love. When she and Jan make love one day, it seems like the logical result of a long development for both. The circle of betrayal begins again… Once more, lives are governed by lies and secrets...Marlene is the one who finds out first and leaves Jan. Leonhard, in his turn, files for divorce from Anja. But this time, history is not about to repeat itself. Jan knows that deep within himself, he loves Marlene. And: he is frightened by Anja's erratic behavior, her possessive love that has assumed pathological traits. A love that threatens her sanity – and her life...",
