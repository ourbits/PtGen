Confidence trickster Alexis Conran, scam artist Paul Wilson and sexy swindler Jessica Clement carry out notorious scams on unsuspecting members of the public, filmed with hidden cameras and intercut with actual interviews from fraud protection experts, police and scam victims.Scams include the fake warehouse employees who grab thousands of pounds with the aid of just a trolley, a pickpocket scam where you do end up with a wallet but lose your cash and a bar proposition bet guaranteed to earn free drinks.The participants featured in The Real Hustle have either been set up by their family and friends or believe that they are participating in another television programme. After they have been hustled for real any monies or property taken during the hustle are returned to them and their consent for the item to be broadcast is obtained so that viewers can avoid being ripped off by the same scam.",
