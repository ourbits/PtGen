    "introduction": "Cleverly titled, and not without some merit, this 1997 flick also has it's hellish features. The sound quality is very poor, and the photography (or the transfer) is muddy. I liked some of the performances, especially by the guys playing Angel and Justin - who register some genuine on-screen chemistry. The script has a few nice ideas (look for the death imagery, some sly, some sledge-hammer obvious) but the dialogue veers toward the cliché more than the clever and in the final reels the subplot about a vain model and his jilted lover turns into silly melodrama. As usual with a Strand DVD, the minimum effort is applied to the packaging. The film isn't quite 'hell' - more like a visit to purgatory.",
