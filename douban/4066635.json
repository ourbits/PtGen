Can't keep a job. Always borrowing money from his father and not paying it back. But Joe Saunders is going to do right by his son just this once: he's not going to lend him any more money. The boy will have to get it on his own. The trouble is, Sam Saunders needs the money to persuade a cheap showgirl to run off with him. And he'll do anything to get it. Meanwhile, an old friend pays Joe a late-night visit.",
