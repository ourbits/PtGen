    "introduction": "From executive producers Tyra Banks and Ashton Kutcher comes True Beauty, an innovative series in which six females and four males live together in Los Angeles as they undergo challenges to determine who is the most beautiful. Though the contestants assume they are being judged on their outer beauty, the judges are evaluating each for their inner beauty. Following an elimination, the contestant voted off will learn the true judging criteria via a video montage of their behavior captured by hidden camera. The last person remaining will win a cash prize and a spot on People magazine's 100 Most Beautiful list.",
