One night, after his mother has gone to bed, he dons leather and heads for a private club. He telephones a tattoo artist with a special request. He goes to confession, accusing himself of despairing. He cries out during a nightmare, waking his mother. \"You're a good boy,\" she's told him. He prays the Stations of the Cross, and he lives out his own sorrowful mysteries.",
