    "introduction": "With their enigmatic smiles, medieval hairdo’s and eccentric biology, sloths are one of the planet’s most wonderfully weird creatures. In a sleepy corner of Costa Rica is a sloth orphanage run by the world’s only sloth whisperer, Judy Arroyo. For 20 years Judy has been rescuing and rehabilitating orphaned and injured sloths with such success that her home is now bursting at the seams with almost two hundred snoozy inmates.This authored documentary follows zoologist and filmmaker Lucy Cooke as she makes a pilgrimage to Judy’s house of sloth to investigate some of the mysteries of sloth behaviour such as why they descend once a week to the bottom of a tree to poo, why they are so very slow, and if they really deserve their title as the world’s laziest animal.",
