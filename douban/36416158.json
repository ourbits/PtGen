    "introduction": "SynopsisA sudden gunshot destroys the dream of two lovers. The fate of Orpheus and Eurydice is a cruel one. On their wedding day, her soul is kidnapped and taken down into the Netherworld. Under a metaphysical sky Charon, the taxi driver, waits for the crime to be committed.COMMENTARYThe movie is an opera-musical with an immersive and transmedial language. The myth is transposed into the contemporary age: Charon is a taxi driver and we go from Paris half under water to the stage of the Teatro Regio in Turin, in a play of musical references that range from Puccini to Händel, from Verdi to Gluck, from Vivaldi to Frankie Goes to Hollywood. And the images fuse words, lyric opera, fashion and the visual arts, between the real and the virtual.DIRECTOR'S STATEMENTWe created an unexpected encounter between acting and lyric opera, between pop, special effects and images filled with symbolism. Bringing into a cast of extraordinary actors such as Vincent Cassel, Fanny Ardant and Rossy De Palma two young artists selected among hundreds of lyric opera singers: Valentino Buzza and Mariam Battistelli.",
