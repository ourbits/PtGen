    "introduction": "《八月的假期》续集。The previous film ended one August evening in 1996, in the Ventotene house where Cecilia (Laura Morante) tells her partner, journalist Sandro Molino (Silvio Orlando), that she’s pregnant. In the sequel, whose screenplay comes courtesy of Francesco Bruni, Carlo Virzì and Paolo Virzì, Altiero Molino is a twenty-six-year-old digital entrepreneur who’s returning to Ventotene with his model husband in order to gather his old friends together around his ailing father so as to treat him to one last holiday in this place which is so special to him. He didn’t expect to find the island all abuzz with Sabry Mazzalupi’s marriage to her partner Cesare. This young woman, who’s the awkward daughter of Roman shopkeeper Ruggero, has become an online celebrity and her wedding is a global event attracting the media as well as mysterious emissaries from the new political regime. These two tribes of vacationers, two seemingly irreconcilable sides of Italy, are destined to come together during the Ferragosto holiday for an ultimate showdown.",
