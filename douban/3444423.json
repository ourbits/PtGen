    "introduction": "»noBody« questions the metaphysical existence of humanity. It addresses the absence of the body, and confronts us with feelings that our own realization of being mortal awakes in us. Without a body, what makes us human? In »noBody« the choreographer, accompanied by 25 dancers, faces the challenge of rendering the non-physical visible by using the physical body itself. »noBody« is co-produced by the Festival d’Avignon. In July 2002, the piece was performed eight times at Cour d’Honneur, Pope Palace. Its unique historical setting, together with the Mendelsohnian architecture of the Schaubühne, was a huge infl uence during the development of this production.",
