    "introduction": "A 'cinema verite' style film filled with snapshots of young kids jumping in the ocean to collect junk in the slums of Baceko Philippines. These children, known as the Bakal Boys, frequently get hurt and suffer from skin irritation and they also lose their hearing ability and their lives. The Bakal Boys, 9-year-old Utoy and 12-year-old Bungal, are close friends almost like brothers. Despite other people's concern, they keep picking up junk in the sea and selling it. One day, after gathering and selling a vast amount of junk, Bungal disappears and Utoy starts looking for him. But Utoy cannot find Bungal.Director Ralston Jover maximizes the realistic portrayal of kids from the slums by starring real bakal boys and using a documentary style. Thus, the life of them weighs heavily down viewers' mind.",
