    "introduction": "Waiting features Ripon Chowdhury, one of some 323,000 migrant workers living in dormitories amongst the city state of Singapore, where the overwhelming majority of Singapore’s more than 50,000 COVID-19 infection cases take place. Since 21 April 2020, the government has imposed strict lockdown measures upon all dormitories, and the migrant workers—mostly hailing from South Asia or China—have been largely confined to their rooms. It is in this context that Ripon Chowdhury was invited by artist Ho Tzu Nyen to contribute to Contactless Deliveries. A poet, writer, and activist from Chittagong, Bangladesh, Chowdhury has been based in Singapore since 2010 as a migrant worker.",
