    "introduction": "Kygo has done it all and in seemingly no time. Hailing from Norway, he not only became the first artist to a billion streams, but he created a new genre altogether, one that is now a staple sound on the radio: tropical house. It wasn't as easy as it sounds. Beginning as a finance major, Kygo, real name Kyrre Gørvell-Dahll, played around with music as a hobby. It wasn't until he dropped out to pursue music that his life began to change. A few years later and now he's come to the legendary Hollywood Bowl for a sold out performance filled with guests and lasers and lights and more visual surprises than one can count. He's always associated this venue with Jimi Hendrix. So how did he get here? In his words, \"That's a good question, actually.\" Exploring his journey from bedroom musician to international sensation, Kygo: Live at the Hollywood Bowl follows Kygo as he prepares for the big show, from arrival to rehearsal, from the green room to the stage. He's joined along the way by a wide array of special guests, including Seal, G-Eazy, Parson James, and Conrad Sewell. Featuring hits like Firestone, Stole the Show, and Sexual Healing, Kygo: Live at the Hollywood Bowl brings Kygo's astounding live show directly to his fans.",
