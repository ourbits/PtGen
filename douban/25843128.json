Laura tries to reconcile her parents but in vain as Janet informs her that she is staying in New York but will provide Laura with a flat. Jamie and his parents are evicted and move into a mobile home which tilts a lot. Jamie then announces that he is quitting school to find work and move into the flat with Laura whilst Beth makes it clear to Mike that she has no desire to keep in touch after their one night stand.",
