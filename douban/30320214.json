    "introduction": "This documentary is shaped around a large painting by Caravaggio (John in the Wilderness, aka John the Baptist). We view the painting through the question of reproduction. The story follows a copy of this painting made in Shenzhen that then goes to a poet in London, who personally struggles with the painting and the image he sees of himself in it. A group of his artist friends attempt to solve his problem. The events in London are paralleled with a slice of life depiction of a Chinese artisan’s family in Shenzhen, south China, reproducing John in the Wilderness.",
