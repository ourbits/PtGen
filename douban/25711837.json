    "introduction": "Open City Documentary Festival 2023In Finding Christa, Camille Billops reunites with her daughter twenty years after giving her up for adoption at age four. More than simply telling the story of a family, Billops and Hatch weave together heterogeneous modes of discourse to reflect on freedom, responsibility, Black women’s construction of selfhood, and the persistence of the past in the present. As Billops puts it, “Finding Christa is a plea for women to think about their choices. You should never let anyone take those choices away from you.”",
