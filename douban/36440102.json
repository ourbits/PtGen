    "introduction": "On an Island, stands a Villa, called “Delle Ginestre.” It is the villa of the Reffi family, the refuge of old Antonio and his two children. Carla, the eldest, a writer, and Celestino, a former doctor with a passion for mathematics. Life on the island flows quietly, sheltered from everything, even emotions, until two thieves on the run land there: Guido, a gambler, and Beatrice, his accomplice and companion, beautiful and fatal. The arrival of the thieves sours the world of the Reffi family, who find themselves at each other’s throats and faced with a doubt: denounce the two guests or give them a chance at redemption?",
