    "introduction": "Whitney (Wagner) owns Marietta Designs, an interior design firm which she runs with her friend, Andi (Tegan Moss). She's designing Santa's float for the town's annual Christmas parade when a potential job opportunity comes her way: the full redesign of a landmark home by Christmas Eve. Despite the challenge, Whitney and Andi sign onto the job-only to discover the home's new owner is Whitney's ex-boyfriend, Connor (Bateman), who has moved to town from Los Angeles with his bright-eyed, young daughter, Daisy (Rubi Tupper). Connor had no intention of becoming a family man, but when his goddaughter is orphaned, he adopts her and commits to becoming a devoted single dad. More than anything, Daisy wishes for a mom to complete her picture-perfect family, and no prospect is as perfect as Whitney. Tall order, but Christmas is a time for miracles.—Parade",
