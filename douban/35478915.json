    "introduction": "For him happiness is nothing but trouble, for her – it may be hidden within the most ordinary moment. He always complains, she is satisfied with small pleasures. For him you have to pay dearly for happiness, she believes it costs as little as a small piece of pastry. Not-So-Little Prince and Prickly Pear are having a philosophical chat about life in a magical café which, out of the blue, is transformed into a forest full of miracles. Their conversation is accompanied not only by doughnuts and rum balls, but also pets and forest animals. A charming, fairy-tale seance, delicate and ephemeral, in which dogs are rolling the dice, a squirrel is running down the table leg and a little mouse is running away with a sack on its back.",
