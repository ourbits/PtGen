Pedro Infante and Miroslava had both great performances. It is about a singer-composer (Pedro Infante) that goes out hunting and when he looses his car, he goes looking for a phone in the area.Destiny took him to a house of wealthy people who think he is a trap. After he is taken care of in the house (he did not said who he was) he has the adventure of his life. He falls in love with the oldest daughter and the real fun begins. Will they know who he really is or will he keep the secret. Great movie.",
