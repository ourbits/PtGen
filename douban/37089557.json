    "introduction": "Sigmund Freud would have loved this dark, hilarious Japanese comedy about father-killing.Critics’ Picks closing film “The Brothers Kitaura” is, like our opening film, a dark comedy about death. In this case though, it’s not about killing yourself but killing your father. 40-year-old Sota Kitaura lives at home with his father. During a fight, Sota accidentally kills his father. Not knowing what to do, he calls his younger brother Akira for help and what ensues is perfect chaos with many references to Hitchcock’s funniest film “The Trouble with Harry” (1955). As if a dead father was not enough, Akira ends up also killing Uncle Daisuke.",
