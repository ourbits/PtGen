    "introduction": "En silencio has no interviews, spotlights or contrived sagas. When an injury rules him out of the European Championships, Isco Alarcón trains away from the noise. Sara Sálamo films from the closest intimacy, while the camera listens to what isn't said. The rhythm of the wounded body also marks the narration: at first slowly, later obstinately. An independent film proposal combining the emotion of sport with the intimacy of the human portrait.",
