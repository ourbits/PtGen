    "introduction": "The film is a kaleidoscope of people, events, feasts, curses, drunkenness and love.a masterpiece from all points of view, 23 October 2007Author: mrisova2002 from BulgariaDescribing Bulgarian reality and \"train life\" with perfect insight. Black humor but that's what keeps us survive here. The slang of the old lady, locked in the train's toilette, is simply a masterpiece. What a wonderful way to spend New Year's Eve. Makes me think of Wild Weed with Meryl Streep and Jack Nickolson. What a comfort that tramps don't differ in their national origin. No national boundaries about the very rich, either. Though, \"they differ from you and me\", as Scott Fitzgerald says in \"The Rich Boy\". Blueberry Hill is however difficult to be understood by foreigners unless they are not acquainted with Bulgarian reality previously. Maybe, the short story \"The Bilgarian poetess\" by John Updike will help more to those who want to understand Bulgaria.",
