But her fears count for little with her chaperone, Madge. A job's a job and tonight Tracey's clients must be satisfied. It's a world away from the one eight year old Sophie inhabits. She still believes in Father Christmas and the Tooth Fairy. But, in the school playground Sophie's belief in the magical is challenged by older, more cynical voices.
