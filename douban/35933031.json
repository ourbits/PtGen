    "introduction": "Game Change Game documents a tumultuous, and at times surreal, basketball season plagued by once unimaginable circumstances. Co-directors Maxime Quoilin and Spike Jordan provide unfettered access to the players union: examining the anxieties and hopes of the players through interviews, and even include first person footage from the subjects themselves. Quoilin and Jordan take us from the NBA bubble to the social uprisings of the Black Lives Matter movement, at a time when the personal could no longer be apolitical.",
