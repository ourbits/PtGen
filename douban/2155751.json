    "introduction": "Obsession cuts the chaos. It's choosing to be with the thing that makes you happy. Obsession brings order. Order simplifies. Blair (Romola Garai) is a young high-flying banker in the City of London. Jono (Adam Lake) is her introverted seventeen-year-old brother. Blair longs to share some common ground with Jono, and feels responsible for his happiness, but only one thing makes Jono happy: the Hollywood movie-star River Phoenix. At a boozy business lunch one October day in 1993, Blair hears of Phoenix's death. Jono is at home on his own. Blair rushes frantically through the chaos of London, desperate to reach her brother with the news. Running for River is a short film about the birth of an icon and the volatility of sibling love.",
