    "introduction": "After a well-executed jewelry store heist, two amateur thugs go on the run. But the police are not too far behind, and after a chase through the countryside, the thugs are apprehended - but only after they stash their loot in a clump of nearby bushes. When two best friends head off into the wilderness on a camping expedition together, luck seems to be on their side when they discover the hidden stash of diamonds. But life is never that easy, and the two thugs, after a daring escape from prison, pick up the trail of the friends, hunting them down in order to reclaim their loot. In the end, the boys' parents come to their rescue, and the two dim-witted criminals are sent back to jail once more - hopefully for good this time!",
