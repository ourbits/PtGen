    "introduction": "Born Mary Ann Evans in 1819, the novelist George Eliot was a woman ahead of her time: a proud and determined individual who continually broke the sexual, religious and social rules of Victorian society.She was one of the greatest minds of her age, yet she debased herself for love.George Eliot - A Scandalous Life explores how the scandals and rumours that plagued her life, never defeated her will or her literary genius; and how, against all odds, she went on to write some of the world's greatest novels including Middlemarch, The Mill on the Floss, and Silas Marner.With access to remaining letters, diaries and newspaper articles, A Scandalous Life creates an intimate portrait of an exceptional woman, who overcame social isolation and rejection to become one of our greatest writers.Presented by George Eliot enthusiast Maureen Lipman, and with Harriet Walter as the writer, George Eliot, A Scandalous Life recreates the events of this extraordinary life.",
