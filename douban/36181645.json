    "introduction": "Ba graduates from college with a major in sousaphone. With his suitcase packed and his instrument straddled to his body, he returns to his hometown, optimistic about finding a satisfactory job as a musical artist. When his father kicks him out for refusing to play for his new girlfriend, Ba begins a journey through the rundown streets of the small, working-class town, encountering a series of taciturn characters both new and familiar.Filmmaker Xu Jingwei’s distinctive animation captures a deadpan, monotonous ennui that is simultaneously humorous and tragic. While Ba’s need for a job becomes increasingly dire, No Changes Have Taken In Our Life is not simply a reflection on this post-graduate dilemma, but an exploration of the desire to progress in a place set in its ways.源自：https://iffr.com/en/iffr/2023/films/no-changes-have-taken-in-our-life",
