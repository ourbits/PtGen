    "introduction": "When the seed of West Side Story's \"Somewhere\" is planted into the soul of a gay child, the quest of The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me begins. In nine inter-connected scenes, acclaimed filmmaker Tim Kirkman (Dear Jesse) interprets this landmark theatrical event written by and starring David Drake, while charting a molten course through the depths and shallows of the urban gay male experience. From the late-night club crawl to the buff-bunny gyms, from the threat of anti-gay violence to the place where condemnation, compromises and closets are a thing of the past-The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me exposes the sexual, spiritual and political yearnings at the heart of gay America.",
