    "introduction": "This is the extraordinary story of Albert Einstein and his decades-long battle to prove his Theory of General Relativity amid the violence of war and his tumultuous personal life.For centuries, Isaac Newton s Law of Gravity stood untouched. But in 1915, Einstein attacked Newton with a mind-boggling theory: Gravity is not pulling you down ... instead, massive bodies like the Sun and the Earth are bending space and time around you, pushing you down. During a total solar eclipse, he predicted, that warp in space-time should reveal itself. Fiercely competitive astronomers raced each other to exotic locations to see if Einstein was right... or wrong. Hardships, weather, and war foiled their expeditions again and again. When, against all odds, a blazing glimpse was finally captured, the humble Einstein exploded into a global icon.本片是在爱因斯坦相对论诞生100周年时的纪念作品，主要讲述爱因斯坦的相对论诞生的整个过程，这期间同样反应了他从小职员到知识巨星的历程，真实的历史事件曲折细腻，完全不逊于任何好莱坞的任何人工雕琢的大片。波澜壮阔的历史造就了无数英雄，这里也同样能够看到爱因斯坦身边的各位同样了不起的人物。",
