    "introduction": "The basic story of this little mini series is based on area 51 and its legend of being an alien hot spot in the middle of the 19th century. The basic story of this doctor who animation is an alien invasion type story with several different aliens (greys, etc) and also plays on some of the common myths of area 51 all wrapped up in the story but i don't want to go too much into it but it is true to the Doctor Who fashion and style, even though i prefer the live action doctor who much more this animation was still highly enjoyable.",
