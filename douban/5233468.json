    "introduction": "alie Export's daring film about relationships, \"Menschenfrauen\" (loosely translated, “humanwomen”), focuses on Franz S., a journalist, and his relationship with four women: the kindergarten nurse Petra, the teacher Gertrude, barmaid Elisabeth and his wife Anna.Franz “doles out honorary pieces of himself to the 'human women' in his seraglio, whispers the same assurances. Eventually, everyone catches on and makes some effort toward independence” (East Village Eye). “A landmark film…Valie Export achieves in 'Menschenfrauen' what Godard strove for but failed in his 'Every Man for Himself'–a human view of a woman's place in a man's world…From credits to close, 'Menschenfrauen' eludes conventional cinematic vision”",
