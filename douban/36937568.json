    "introduction": "The fun and fumbles of raising kids continues for Astrid (Rath), who now faces the pressure of being the sole bread winner, and James (Abrams), who struggles with his new role of stay-at-home dad. Parenting is more challenging and funnier than ever with tween Felix (Nicholson) asserting more independence and attitude, seven-year-old Viv (SwamiNathan) dealing with friend drama at school, and Morris, a toddler who steals. Meanwhile, Astrid’s sister Dawn (Contractor) and her husband Bo (Chepovetsky) fuss over their surrogate’s pregnancy, Bo’s business find new success under Marla’s (Codrington) watchful eye, and James’s best pal Ennis (Esmer) finally commits to a relationship. The complications of work and child-rearing may pull Astrid and James in different directions but they always end up on the same page – even if that page is dog-eared and stained with jam.",
