    "introduction": "Since he first took the charts by storm in 1982 as a member of Wham!, George Michael has become British pop royalty.Over the past two decades he’s had a string of hit singles and albums, from 80s classics including Faith and Careless Whisper to more recent hits such as Outside, Amazing and Flawless.George Michael: A Different Story, which was first shown on BBC One, sees the singer opening up for the first time about his career as well as his turbulent personal life, which has seen him come under the spotlight in recent years.As well as revealing more about his childhood in Bushey, Hertfordshire, Michael gets together with Andrew Ridgeley to discuss the Wham! years. He also talks about his later career – including his battles with record label Sony – as well as his recent protest songs, speaking out against George Bush and the Iraq war.The singer also offers some candid insights into his private life, discussing the pain of losing his Brazilian boyfriend Anselmo to Aids – as well as his notorious arrest in a Beverly Hills park toilet in 1998. Michael says that he now regards the incident, which saw him charged with lewd behaviour, as a moment of madness and ultimately a relief!As well as Michael, the show features contributions – some of them critical – from a host of big names, including Sir Elton John, Boy George, Mariah Carey, Noel Gallagher and Simon Cowell.This version of the programme features an extra 15 minutes worth of footage that was not shown on BBC One.",
