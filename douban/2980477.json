    "introduction": "UN-VALENTINE'S DAY: It's that warm and wonderful time when Pooh and his pal like to show how much they care. But Rabbit wants to cancel Valentine's Day because last year, he was up to his ears in the flood of cards that littered the Hundred Acre Wood. Reluctantly, everyone agrees -- until someone anonymously sends Pooh a pot of honey. Suddenly, the Valentine rush is again out of control, much to the delight of all -- including Rabbit! Then, as a special bonus, experience the charm and fun of \"The Three Little Piglets.\" A VALENTINE FOR YOU: After Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, and Rabbit see Christopher Robin making a valentine for -- gasp! -- a girl, they find he's been bitten by a \"Smitten\" and is lovesick! Worried that he'll no longer have time for them, and hoping a second bite from the love bug will cure him, they set out on a wild adventure to capture the Smitten. This wonderful story, filled with magic and whimsy, and sweetened with three new songs, reminds us all that the heart is big and always has plenty of room for friends -- old and new.",
