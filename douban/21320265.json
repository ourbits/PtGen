    "introduction": "In \"Your Day is My Night\", a collective of Chinese performers living in New York City explores the history and meaning of \"shiftbeds\" through verité conversations, autobiographical monologues and integrated movement pieces. On screen, the seven performers play themselves, while living together with a young Puerto Rican woman in a shift-bed apartment on Hester Street in the heart of Chinatown. The concept of the shift-bed allows us as viewers to see the private become public, as the bed transforms into a stage for our characters to reveal the struggles and joys of their lives. \"Your Day is My Night\" is a provocative hybrid documentary that looks at issues of privacy, intimacy, and community in relationship to this familiar item of household furniture.",
