    "introduction": "After the 1974 revolution, Portugal lived in a semi-revolutionary state before evolving into a constitutional system that ended dreams of a utopian society. During this period, the country was dominated by political turmoil and the occupation of nationalized private properties by starving workers and farmers. German documentarian Thomas Harlan landed in Portugal and shot Torre Bela, a fascinating portrait of the occupation of a large estate. Harlan’s militant, anthropological study of the spontaneous creation of a commune captures the political discussions of brave, innocent leaders and the hesitant support of a military hierarchy dealing with its own struggles amid the imminent threat of anarchy.",
