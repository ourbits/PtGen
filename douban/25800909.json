    "introduction": "GATOR BOYS follows the death-defying exploits of Paul Bedard and Jimmy Riffle, two extraordinary alligator trappers who risk injury and death to hand-capture nuisance alligators that have invaded the back yards, swimming pools, garages and bedrooms of Florida Everglades residents.It takes serious skill to do what the GATOR BOYS do. Paul is known for his commanding personality and unmatched expertise, capturing any-sized gator underwater with his bare hands. And Jimmy has been gator wrestling since he was 11-years-old, giving him the unmatched ability to handle nearly any dangerous reptile with ease.The duo get face-to-face with ferocious alligators whose jaws have 3,500 pounds of crushing power per square inch. The goal of Gator Boys Alligator Rescue is to get alligators out of harm’s way before they are captured and killed by rival trappers, who will kill the gators and sell them for their skin and meat.",
