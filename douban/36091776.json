    "introduction": "One Hand Clapping is a found footage film in which the hands of five chief conductors of the Royal Concert Hall Orchestra perform a dazzling dance. The images are taken from historical concert recordings on which Peter Delpeut and editor Menno Otten have extremely zoomed in. Spread across five frames these conducting hands perform a choreography of encouraging and holding back, detaching themselves gradually from the conductors and transforming into one flying, boxing and dancing body. The captivating music by Dutch composer Harry de Wit enhances the mind boggling energy.",
