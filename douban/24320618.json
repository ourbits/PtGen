    "introduction": "Four Idle Hands is a British teen drama first broadcast in 1976.It charts the unsteady progress of Mike (Phil Daniels) and Pete (Ray Burdis), two 16-year-old school-leavers who are forced to ponder the urgent and bewildering question of what are they going to do for a living.Without a vocation to follow or any demonstrable skills, their efforts to avoid the dole queue land them in a succession of disastrous jobs - to the despair of both their parents and the school career officer.",
