    "introduction": "Poland and the Czech Republic. Relationship status? Complicated, of course. On our part, there's a sense of superiority disguised as condescending fascination. On the other hand, ostentatious indifference. Sometimes, as in the case of the dispute over pollution emitted across the Czech border by the Polish Turów mine, minor disagreements escalate into serious diplomatic tensions. However, instead of escalating and giving voice to politicians trying to gain their own capital, it's worth taking a closer look at the situation. Piotr Jasiński approaches it from this premise. As a student at FAMU in Prague, the director set off with a camera to Bogatynia, where the critical mine is located. On-site, it turned out that the locals, rather than being preoccupied with media reports, were immersed in an annual competition for the best potato salad. So, perhaps there are no problems that cannot be resolved at a common table after all?源自：https://www.nowehoryzonty.pl/vod-film.s?id=12977",
