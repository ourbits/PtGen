    "introduction": "Bob, a morning news anchor in the big city, goes back to his childhood home in Rocky Mountains after learning that his father, John, has passed away suddenly. Upon arriving at the Rock Lake Lodge, Bob's wife, Lula, with her designer clothes and her high heels, is completely misplaced and unprepared for her remote surroundings. We are then introduced to Smiley and Kevin, Bob's brothers who have clearly never ventured to any metropolitan area. After the funeral, Bob, Lula, Kevin, and Smiley watch a video of John reciting his last will and testament. He wishes that Bob stay and continue the reality TV show that they started before he moved to the big city. Bob is now faced with the decision of giving up the life that he has built in the city to honor his late father's wishes.",
