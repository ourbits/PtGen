Jagodowski make up their entire act on the spot. This documentary records one of the long-running improv duo's hilarious performances at New York City's Barrow Street Theatre. The film also goes behind the scenes as the pair strategizes for that night's act, discusses the nuances of their creative partnership and reflects on their training at Chicago's The Second City improv troupe.",
