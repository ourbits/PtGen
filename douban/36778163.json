    "introduction": "BBC Comedy and BBC Scotland have commissioned Happy Tramp North to produce Only Child, a brand-new sitcom starring Greg McHugh (The A Word, Fresh Meat) as only child and budding author Richard, who travels back to his family home in North East Scotland to look after his aging and wilful dad Ken, played by Gregor Fisher (Rab C Nesbitt, Love Actually, The Cockfields), as he slips into ever more eccentric and erratic behaviour.Written by Bryce Hart, Only Child (6x30) is a fictional comedy for BBC One and BBC iPlayer from Happy Tramp North (co-producers of the hit BBC show Guilt) which sees neighbourly squabbles, domestic and inter-generational differences all told through the lens of Richard and Ken’s father-son relationship.Richard’s long overdue visit to recently-widowed Ken results in him realising that his dad may need a bit more full time help than he’d realised. Not that Ken would agree, but that statement is pretty much true about anything. Ken is an eccentric, strong-willed technophobe who is very much set in his ways, leaving Richard to worry about his dad growing old. Showcasing a wealth of Scottish talent, it will be filmed in Glasgow and around the North East of Scotland.",
