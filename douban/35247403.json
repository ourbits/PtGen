However, ethnic communities have abysmally low numbers for their bone marrow registries. There is a dire need for ethnic community donors especially in the Indian, South Asian and Middle Eastern communities. Many needless deaths can be prevented if these donor numbers could change. With a cast comprised of global celebrities, medical experts and cancer patients; \"Finding Match\" endeavors to make that change.",
