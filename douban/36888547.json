    "introduction": "Infinity: What on Earth Are We Thinking? is a new entertaining and engaging, high quality feature documentary film series, exploring one of the most significant unanswered questions of our time 'Does infinity exist?'. Conversations with leading thinkers from multiple disciplines reveal the latest in scientific research and a broad range of perspectives and insights.Infinity: What on Earth Are We Thinking? is a film of great beauty and scientific substance but is also very much about the human perspective of infinity. Conversations with scientists, philosophers, religious leaders, artists and more are merged into a filmic narrative with a powerful soundtrack and stunning visuals. If infinity exists, then it implies that the big bang is an incomplete theory and we have to look towards the multiverse theory as the most likely scenario. What does infinity mean for our spiritual existence and continuation of life on earth and beyond?Episode 1 The Scale of Things [43m 41s]Episode 2 The Beginning? [41m 47s]Episode 3 Everything or Nothing? [50m 7s]A Flickapolitan Production.",
