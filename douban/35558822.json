    "introduction": "Prime Video announced that the eight-episode docuseries Tampa Baes will drop this fall.The streaming service briefly teased the series on social media, introducing its subjects as “the young lesbian ‘it-crowd’ navigating and celebrating life in Tampa Bay — Florida’s LGBTQ+ hub and the place to see and be seen.” The titular Tampa baes are friends, of course, but sometimes more than that, too. Movers and shakers, they’re “always ready for an adventure or a good party” but they reportedly have a serious side as well. The official description characterizes the cast as “ambitious and unapologetic while constantly battling stereotypes and labels.”",
