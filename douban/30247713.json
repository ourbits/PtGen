    "introduction": "In 'Gek van Geluk', Plien van Bennekom steps into the role of single mum Lena. Lena writes love songs but it stumped with writer's block due to the lack of romance in her life. That is until Valerie (Carly Wijs), singer and Lena's best friend, comes up with a solution: she hires an unemployed actor to turn Lena's head and kick start her inspiration. Lena falls head over heels for the handsome Hugo (Matteo van der Grijn) and it appears the plan has worked. That is until Lena becomes so distracted by the butterflies in her stomach that a new hit single is the last thing on her mind. In a desperate attempt to get Lena writing again Valerie puts their year-long friendship on the line and confronts Lena with the truth.",
