    "introduction": "My fourth upload from Loevy's box and undoubtedly one of his very best, Indian in the sun is a short drama about some of the extremes in israeli society, examined in a refined way that manages to reveal much more than the usual upfront way many local films chose to take.The plot is very simple, but I fear some of the inner tensions will go unnoticed by those unfamiliar with the inter racial problems in Israel, but don't let that keep you from watching it, it's really that good.",
