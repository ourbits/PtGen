This point has to be reached.\" (Franz Kafka)Story of a sin that looks like an accident in the beginning but in reality it's an irrevocable and deadly act. Story of a relationship in which lies and love chains daughter to father, sinner to innocent. Story of a man whose fate suddenly starts to turn another way - and buries everything it finds beneath itself.\"You never think about sin, but then you are standing in front of it and it touches you.\" (Attila Janisch)Another great \"sin-movie\" (as the director refers his works) from this excellent Hungarian director.",
