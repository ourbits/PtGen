    "introduction": "Filmed on location in Harlem, USA, and in Claude Monet’s historic gardens in Giverny, France, The Giverny Document is a multi-textured cinematic poem that meditates on the safety and bodily autonomy of Black women. The filmmaker unleashes an arsenal of techniques and materials including direct animation on archival 16mm film, woman-on-the-street interviews, and montage editing techniques to explore the creative virtuosity of Black femme performance figures while interrogating the histories of those bodies as spaces of forced labor and commodified production.",
