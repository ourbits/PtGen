    "introduction": "日本男孩与摩洛哥裔荷兰女孩的邂逅与重逢。一部值得一看的跨国短剧作品。Yuichi from Japan travels to the Netherlands looking for Naïma, who he fell in love with as a teenager when they met in Casablanca. He finds her but they have no way of understanding each other as Naïma doesn't speak Japanese and Yuichi doesn't speak Dutch or English. The viewer, however, has the luxury of subtitles. We follow the story of two people with clear chemistry between them who struggle with the giant language barrier that separates them. Being able to understand both of them, the viewer quickly realizes these two people are soul mates suffering a cruel twist of fate. The story is very sweet, it will make you smile and leave you with a tear on your cheek. Even in today's modern and globalized world, there are some gaps we fail to bridge.",
