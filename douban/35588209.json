    "introduction": "HBO Sports and NFL Films are partnering with “America's Team,\" the Dallas Cowboys, for an unfiltered, all-access look at what it takes to make it in the National Football League with Hard Knocks: The Dallas Cowboys.This 16th edition of the 18-time Sports Emmy®-winning series spotlights the Cowboys for the third time -- after having previously featured them in 2002 and 2008 -- as the players and coaches enter the 2021 NFL season looking to improve upon last year's third-place finish in the NFC East.In their second year under head coach Mike McCarthy, the Cowboys look forward to having franchise quarterback Dak Prescott back under center to lead Dallas' high-powered offense, which features the likes of running back Ezekiel Elliott and wide receivers Amari Cooper, Michael Gallup, and CeeDee Lamb. New defensive coordinator Dan Quinn also leads an impressive group, which features Demarcus Lawrence, Jaylon Smith, and first-round pick Micah Parsons.",
