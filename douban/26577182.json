He embarked on a forbidden love affair with Zsuzsi Starkloff, a glamorous divorcee, model and former air hostess which was to end in disaster.In her first televised interview, Zsuzsi Starkloff will tell the story of their forbidden relationship and the disapproval it caused behind the doors of Buckingham Palace, still reeling from the scandal of Edward’s abdication for the love of Mrs Simpson.",
