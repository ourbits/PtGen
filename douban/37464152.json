    "introduction": "The comedy series shows an open relationship in which the dominant Heidi (Odine Johne) lives with the conflict-shy Juklas (Julius Feldmeier) and the dreamy Becky (Kristin Suckow). So Becky also has to share Micha (Leon Ullrich) with the other two when she spontaneously brings him along. But Heidi doesn't think that she has to share young Akki (Lea van Acken) with the others at the same time. However, this inconsistent arrangement is not the biggest problem for the threesome. Just as Becky is due to carry a baby together, Heidi receives a terrible diagnosis. She is suffering from a fatal lung disease that is probably accelerated by climate change. The lovers decide they must do something immediately. But what?",
