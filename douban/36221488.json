    "introduction": "每年日本申请专利的新品种食材多达千种，《头号食谱》节目组将挖掘这些新品类食材，并邀请全国知名大厨为新食材首创一道食谱，最终将由美食评审团现场试吃点评，选出每期神奇食材的\"头号食谱\"。There is a huge number of ingredients in the world.What we usually eat is just a small part of them…In this show, great chefs cook unknown ingredients that they have never seen.The ingredient looks/tastes strange. The chef is firstly surprised at such an unknown, but gradually grasps its features and seeks how to make it delicious with his brilliant skill and experience.Most of chefs have Michelin stars! They cast an incredible spell on unknowns!",
