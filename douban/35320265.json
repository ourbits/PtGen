    "introduction": "Far from showing a shipwreck as an adventure, La encomienda reveals the traumatic experience suffered by those who fight for their lives in extraordinary circumstances, in which both hopelessness and their own patience become powerful enemies. The new film by Pablo Giorgelli, director of the acclaimed Las acacias (2011) and Invisible (2017), follows the footsteps of Pietro, a deck worker on a ship used for illegal trafficking that blows up in the middle of the ocean. As the ocean –as immense as it is menacing– advances on the rescue boat that keeps him afloat, the protagonist aims to get to the nearest coast together with Benel, a young Dominican who tries to illegally emigrate to the US. With skill, few dialogue and powerful visual and sound ideas, the filmmaker delivers an intimate drama about migration, family ties, inequality and survival instinct, which he puts to the test during the film’s entire running time.",
