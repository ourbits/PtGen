An abandoned water truck was found in the Thai countryside containing more than 100 trafficked migrants; some 50 died while others disappeared. His investigation centers on The Pearl, a popular destination for sex tourists, and the place where Jason poses as a john so he can secretly meet with women and girls forced to work as prostitutes. Certain a young girl known only as Number 18 can be a key witness for his case, Jason must convince 18 to testify against her cut throat pimp. As Jason starts to build a relationship with 18, he sees in her reflections of the young daughters he has left far away at home in the USA. The riddle to solve the secrets of the abandoned water truck gets more complicated for Jason and his boss Marta when they come under increasing pressure from power brokers in Washington DC who are finalizing a key Asian trade deal. When his investigation starts to unravel, Jason realizes that rather than save 18 from her horrific circumstances he has put her life at risk. With a crime syndicate now chasing him down and no resources but his own wits, Jason must try rescue 18 in the crowded city before the pimp moves her, for good.",
