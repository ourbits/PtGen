    "introduction": "A carpenter’s apprentice, Spaan (‘Chip’), has been thrown out by his master for being romantically involved with his daughter, Ernestine. On the road, he meets the slender tailor’s apprentice Naal (‘Needle’) and the drunken shoemaker’s apprentice Syl (Awl), and the three form a warm friendship. One day, they are lucky to win a large sum of money in the lottery, after which they go their separate ways with the promise of meeting up again one year later. Here it turns out that in spite of their newly acquired wealth, not all of them have fared well.",
