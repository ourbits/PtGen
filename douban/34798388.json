    "introduction": "Dan Bell provides director's commentary for the re-release of his popular 2015 short video \"Dan Bell: TRAPPED AND TERRIFIED\". Dan not only discusses the making of the short, but several reasons why he removed it from his channel after only a few months and why he's chosen to re-release it now. This Orson Welles inspired short made an impression on the people who saw it in its initial 2015 release. For people who saw it then and newcomers alike, this commentary provides further information on not only the filming of the short and the people who appear in it. Dan's commentary also contains further information on his current projects and the direction in which he is taking his filmmaking.",
