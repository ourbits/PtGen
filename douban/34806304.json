    "introduction": "For nearly a century, the image of the Airstream travel trailer, with sunlight gleaming off the aluminum of its sleek silver-bullet body, has evoked the romance of escape and the mystique of a world where a new adventure is waiting just over the next hill. No matter the model of Airstream — Bambi, Caravel, Flying Cloud, Tommy Bahama, Classic, Serenity — Wally Byam’s invention offers an elegant passport to a world where friendship, communion with nature, and international caravans continually weave together in unforgettable moments. Narrated by Kate Pierson of the B-52s, Eric Bricker’s film unpacks the evolution of Airstreams from simple trailers into platforms for free-spirited living.",
