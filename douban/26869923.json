    "introduction": "A smug young monk embarks upon an intriguing journey only to discover that the wisdom he seeks is much closer than he imagines, and much stranger than he could possibly envisage. Set against the stunning backdrop of the Himalayas, Lodro battles the elements, braves the seductions of beautiful women, chases enchanted children and encounters a magical mule that can read, in his attempt to reach the mythical mountain of Wutaishan, in search of Manjushri. Finding Manjushri was produced on a shoestring budget in a Tibetan refugee settlement in northern India. It is a delightful and uplifting story, delivered with charm and humor, that explores Tibetan Buddhism's unconventional concept of wisdom and carries a universal message that resonates across cultures.",
