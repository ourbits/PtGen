Soon it becomes known to Bersenev that his wife Vera, Polyansky's mistress, is also involved in the crime. During the investigation, Bersenev recognizes Polyansky as the owner of the apartment in which he himself was hiding from the Tzar's secret police agents during the years of the revolution. After painful hesitation, Bersenev takes the case to court and, taking the child, leaves his wife.",
