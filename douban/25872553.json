Upon arrival we enter a world of immigrant trafficking, and life is turned upside-down as she's enslaved by an international criminal ring. Forced to beg on the subway, Olga uses courage, cunning, and even humor, to face an unimaginable nightmare-on-loop that ravages the audience. Based on a real case broken by the NYPD.",
