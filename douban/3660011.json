    "introduction": "After the United States placed a trade embargo on Cuba in the 1960s, many classic American automobiles were effectively stranded in the country -- victims of short and costly supplies of gasoline and dwindling spare parts. From Cadillacs to Buicks, the cars became an important symbol of success and freedom for many Cubans. This unique documentary is a must-see for history buffs as well as automobile enthusiasts all over the world.",
