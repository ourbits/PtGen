    "introduction": "At the foothills of the Empire, some go fishing, some go flirting. Time flies. Cigarette after cigarette, we reinvent the world. When the weather is good on the other side, we can see the lost Paradise. Is it a mirage? Walking the streets of the city, shouting so that we are not lonely in fear. Opening the tiny apartment to welcome in the world around. Collaborating, sabotaging. We walk, we talk. Some rise, some fall. It feels beautiful, even when it fails. We try to cease the urgency to be together. A former railwayman sinking into History, a teacher wandering through the night tracking down the police, an Afghan hiding away, two unemployed quantum boys, a mustached host and his Eritrean women… They cross paths, skim, avoid each other; their trajectories define a space where the daily reality is yet to be reinvented, in a world constantly falling apart. The time has come for us to become unreasonable: the whole world is passing through Calais.烂番茄小组：http://www.douban.com/group/rottentomatoes/",
