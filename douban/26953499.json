    "introduction": "»Der Springteufel« was shot for the 1st (West) German public-sector TV broadcaster ARD in 1974 and is a quite typical, but still very entertaining, twisted and well-shot hitchhiker thriller. The hitchhiker is played by German comedy and cabaret legend Dieter Hallervorden, who is famous mostly for his character »Didi«, which he played in comedy films like »Didi – Der Doppelgänger« or »Didi und die Rache der Enterbten«, though he also starred in a lot of German crime films and series and in the scifi-action classic »Das Millionenspiel« (likely to be his most acclaimed role).",
