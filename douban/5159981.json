    "introduction": "August 9 2006. Three Mexican fishermen are found near the Marshall Islands, more than 5,000 miles away from home, after 9 months and 9 days adrift. They declared, \"We survived by eating raw fish, capturing rain water and our faith in God\". A book editor from Atlanta, and a Colombian cosmetics seller living in Mexico City, see in this story a message from God they must spread. Weeks later they all sign a contract for 3 million dollars to make a film of their ordeal. It seems that the real danger is still to come.",
