    "introduction": "His saxophone sound changed jazz. Nervous and infinitely melodious. The filmmakers René Jeucken, Thomas Mau and Grischa Windus follow in the footsteps of Peter Brötzmann, from his backyard studio in Wuppertal, to the winding alleyways of the colorful, poverty-stricken London district of Hackney. On the occasion of his 70th birthday, Peter Brötzmann's eleven-member Chicago Tentet is touring Europe and the Middle East: the big Jubilee concerts, 53 years after the radical anti-concept album Machine Gun, are still stirring. And while the world-famous saxophonist talks about old friends, new images and freedom, colleagues, journalists and bar owners tell of their very own memories of the uncompromising pioneer of free jazz, his fascinating inspiration and his long cigars.",
