    "introduction": "Footprints is a docu-fiction short about grief and memory. The film presents a study of solitude, a stasis that sets in when one’s memories hover, like ghosts, in the present. The film is a personal portrait of the director’s mother, a spiritual rendition of grief and remembrance, showing how the absence of loved ones itself becomes one’s companion.",
