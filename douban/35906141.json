Daniel has never left the city; today he lives with his girlfriend, Vera, and works for his mother's real estate agency. Lara and Daniel's lives cross while visiting a flat for sale; but this may not be the first time they have met. Halfway between the past and the present, STILLNESS IN THE STORM explores the love story of two people whose lives, in other circumstances, in other times, could have taken other paths.",
