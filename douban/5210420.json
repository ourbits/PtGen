    "introduction": "This documentary musical, filmed in a female prison, was created and produced in collaboration with inmates, and based on their life experiences.Filmed at HMP Downview, in Surrey, the film eschews conventional documentary techniques in favour of music and specially composed songs to explore the realities of life in the prison. The musical styles reflect the interests and passions of the different subjects, ranging from rap and ballad to spoken word. By offering participants an opportunity to express themselves in a creative way, the film invites audiences to rethink preconceptions they might have about women in prison.",
