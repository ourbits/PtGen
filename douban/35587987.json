    "introduction": "This is a monument to the Tlatelolco massacre of 1968 in Mexico City, ten days before the opening of the Olympics. Hundreds of civilian protesters were gunned down or simply disappeared, yet no justice has been served even decades later. This film is nearly wordless. In place of words, increasing violence is enacted against the images, its grotesqueness commensurate with the complete physical obliteration of the students who organised for progressive change.",
