    "introduction": "Great movie! I believe some of the artwork for this film - if not all - was commissioned to Carlos Zamora. Zamora is a local Peruvian artist who's recent work has gotten excellent reviews. Peruvian films are well noted for containing a social and moral complexity in the dynamics of the subjects, which results in a story delivering several combinations of moods and genre. Daniel Rodriguez has done several shorts, but I'm definitely looking forward to seeing more of the full length films that he'll be bringing about. Overall, this movie is a must-see.",
