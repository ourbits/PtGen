    "introduction": "A film student searches the Internet for ideas for the horror film and finds HELL PAGE, an interactive horror script writing programme. She accepts all the conditions without reading them, and enters people around her as characters for the script. Hell Page starts to write, but what she doesn't realize is that what it writes - HAPPENS. By the time she realizes three people are dead and every time the programme switches itself on, she knows real horror is around the corner.",
