    "introduction": "Documenting the artists breaking down borders in a region torn by historic conflict.Palestine Underground by Boiler Room, 4:3 and Ma3azef documents the resilience of a burgeoning music scene undeterred and fuelled by political restrictions, building bridges through a shared sound and identity.For the past ten years, Palestinian music collective Jazar Crew have been fostering a vibrant party scene in Haifa, as an alternative to the mainstream club scene in Israel.Thanks to the internet, they've connected with artists in Ramallah, Palestine, and defied the separation wall to travel to the West Bank and organise events with Techno DJs Sama' Abdulhadi and Oddz, and members of the tantalising hip hop and trap scene, the collectives Saleb Wahad and Bltnm.Palestine Underground follows a week in the life of these artists and friends, in the lead up to the first Boiler Room in Ramallah in June this year.",
