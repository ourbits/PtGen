    "introduction": "This is Great Britain in 2015, and men's roles are changing as fast as everything else in British life. So Reggie Yates has come home to the UK to find out why some young men feel so undersexed, unheard, and even under attack.What do they think of the opposite sex, and how do they view themselves? From dealing with homophobia to dishing out anti-feminism, and from steroid-fuelled self-obsession to stifled self-expression, Reggie is on a three-part journey to the dark side of modern British masculinity, in a nation struggling to man up.",
