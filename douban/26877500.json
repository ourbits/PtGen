    "introduction": "In May 1972, twenty-five Hamilton, Ontario high school students and teachers went to China. Not unusual today, but they were then the first students to visit China from North America since 1949, when Mao Tse Tung’s Communists overthrew the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-Shek .The 1974 film Impressions of China is a documentary record of that tour. The content and viewpoint – enthusiastic, witty and perceptive — make this film a unique experience in China studies.This early documentary by veteran documentarian Donald McWilliams has been recently restored by the National Film Board of Canada for a new audience. The screening in the 1st Canada China International Film Festival at Montreal is its première.",
