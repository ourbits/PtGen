    "introduction": "\"In Adam Ruins Everything\", host Adam meijubar.net Conover employs a combination of comedy, history and science to dispel widespread misconceptions about everything we take for granted. A perfect blend of entertainment and enlightenment, Adam Ruins Everything is inviting, fast-paced and, above all, smart. Adam is like that friend who knows a little bit too much about everything and is going to tell you about it...whether you like it or not. Adam Ruins Everything isn't just fun to watch, but addictively informative. It's everything you didn't want to need to know. The show was born out of a popular CollegeHumor original series that has generated more than 30 million views since premiering online with the video \"Why Engagement Rings Are a Scam\" in early 2014.",
