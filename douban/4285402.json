Princess Margaret was one of the most eligible women in the world.The Snowdons epitomized \"The Swinging Sixties\" - by far and away the most glamorous and modern members of the Royal Family. Their volatile marriage ended in scandal and divorce in 1978 - the first royal divorce for over four hundred years. At the time, Princess Margaret was blamed. Tony was seen as the wronged husband.Tony and Margaret: Inside a Royal Marriage tells a different story, drawing on extensive archive footage, unprecedented access to Lord Snowdon's friends and family and exclusive material gathered by his biographer, Anne de Courcy.",
