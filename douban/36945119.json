    "introduction": "An epic new series, filmed over three years, travels to the extremes on all seven continents to meet an extraordinary group of people and animals living and working on the front line of climate change. They reveal how science, nature and tradition can prepare us for the future.Our planet is heating twice as fast as it was four decades ago and the implications for our planet and everything living on it are huge. As temperatures rise, icecaps and glaciers melts, oceans warm, forests burn, and weather patterns change, the world as we know it is placed under threat. Ancient connections between plants, animals and people are undermined. The rules that dictated stability have been re-written with new climate change winners and losers exposed.The scale of the problem and the future prognosis is overwhelming. But an extraordinary group of local conservationists, scientists, and indigenous leaders offer hope.Episode 1: “Ice”Episode 2: “Fire”Episode 3: “Water”Episode 4: “Earth”[Credits]Produced by NHNZ Worldwide in association with ARTE France, SKY NZ and Blue Ant International for PBS. Sue Woodfield and Martha Jeffries are the Executive Producers. Ben Lawrie is the Series Producer. Executives in Charge for PBS are Diana El-Osta and Bill Gardner.",
