In a Wizard of Oz-like spoof, Jack is knocked out by a broom in black and white and when he wakes up he finds himself in 'Arlenland' and with everything in color. He then begins a journey to find Harold Arlen and along the way he meets Diahann Carroll, Johnny Mathis, Dinah Shore, Cass Elliot, and Doc Severinsen who each perform various Harold Arlen songs. Jack eventually finds Harold Arlen and the show ends with the song 'Over the Rainbow'.",
