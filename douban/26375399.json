    "introduction": "Two couples and their children go on an excursion into the forest.They are young, successful and well-set parts in today's social-political establishment. When their children disappear in a storm, the entire construct of their friendship starts to crumble. Very soon, their bourgeoisie façade falls and the four turn into the profile of a lost culture. What follows is an odyssey through the forests that turns more and more into a journey into the metaphysical.",
