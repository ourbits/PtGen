    "introduction": "A free-wheeling comedy, Zur Sache Schaetzchen chronicles a day in the life of Martin, a witty yet lazy songwriter who'd rather not get out of bed. During the opening sequence, Martin watches a break-in on the other side of the street. In the morning, his friend Henry forces him to report it to the police, yet Martin gets bored with the cops and flees. The two of them spent the rest of the day escaping the law, in the Munich zoo and a public bath, were Martin meets Barbara. Block, the record company executive, needs Martin's new song lyrics right away, and Martin, who continually cranks out mad random remarks, comes up with a ridiculous sailor song. In the end, Martin's playful- ness collides with the authority the police represents. The movie is certainly not plot based; it draws its superior humor from one-liners and the hilarious, carefree insanity of its protagonist.",
