    "introduction": "Russian Winter is a terrible thing...... especially if it arrives in mid-July. \"Along the street a snowstorm sweeps, behind the snowstorm ... something ghastly creeps!\" Konstantin - a Moscow journalist, hides from the onslaught with the daughter of a local tycoon in a hardware store. Captain Igor Knyazev kranks up the only working tank, whilst his lover, Dasha is running away from her angry husband, who has learned of the pair's betrayal, and wants revenge, regardless of the weather ... Faced with horrifyingly gripping news material, a dedicated cameraman, Vlad, captures the strange events on video as priest Father Michael gets out his trusty axe ... Out amidst the icy storm, something raises its hideous head - a Russian zombie - senseless and merciless!",
