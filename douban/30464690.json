    "introduction": "Between 1965-1968 Luc Ferrari with his best friend Gérard Patris made a five-part series of documentaries for French television based on the concept of discussing the work of and/or working with composers he admired (including Olivier Messiaen, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Edgar Varèse, Hermann Scherchen and Cecil Taylor) whilst in rehearsals. Fascinated by the emergence of American Free Jazz, Luc Ferrari interviews Cecil Taylor in Paris with his band (bassist) Alan Silva, (saxophonist) Jimmy Lyons and (drummer) Andrew Cyrille.",
