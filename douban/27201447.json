    "introduction": "Jack, a teen visiting Tuscany to see the genuine sword in the stone, sucked into a wormhole tackles a journey in the Middle Ages. The narrative begins with elderly Alferius, sent to Bavaria by Guaimario Prince of Salerno. During a violent storm Alferius meets an old Norwegian druid in exile, who tells how miraculously he escaped the sinking of a Viking fleet. The druid gives him a magic sword, a coin and a raven. Despite his best efforts, Alferius never reaches Bavaria because in Pavia he is arrested as a traitor and jailed in a castle. After nearly ten years, when he finally manages to find the Old Codex Amiatinus, he decides to start back. The second half of the film is set at the Amalfi Coast. In a tavern, four drunks gamble and tell what happened during last 150 years, from the secret journey of Eleanor of Aquitaine, to birth of Templars. Jack, now living Galgano's life, is able to swing again his legendary sword, until one day he becomes saint, as he puts the sword in the stone.",
