    "introduction": "Pity young performer Sissy St. Claire: she is allowed to shine in her very own TV special on Saturday night, but this doesn’t turn out as expected. Sissy gives her all in the show which – with its songs, sketches, and a question-and-answer section – closely follows the old-time, American variety evening TV formats, complete with commercial breaks. Expect disco balls, glitter outfits, and Stars and Stripes prints in this spectacle beamed straight from a whole other shimmery analogue video epoch.In spite of the canned laughter, a feeling of desperation and unease encroaches on Give Me Pity!. A shadowy figure is lurking somewhere behind the scenes. Is it a stalker? Or, is it all in the actress’s imagination? And, why are there spots of blood on the letter received? The part of Sissy – who is struggling to navigate between the roles of mother, whore, wife, and victim – is played by Sophie Von Haselberg, who pulls out all the stops for this one-woman show.",
