    "introduction": "「妳很面熟。」TACO在捷運月台搭訕一名叫凱西的女子──她沒趕上列車。他跟她說一個有關「凱西」的故事：他前女友們都叫做凱西，自從被第一個凱西甩了之後，後來的每個女友都有著第一個凱西的影子──這麼說並不準確，因為她們長相幾乎一樣，你可以說，她們都是第一個凱西的複刻板。而且她們無時不刻出現在他的生活。例如他才跟這個凱西分手，下一秒又遇到了另一個凱西呢，諸如此類。雖然他不想幫她們編號，她們卻都有個數字刺青在脖子上。除了凱西五號，因為她從來不給TACO看她的脖子，他拼命想看，她越是不讓他看。那麼，她的脖子有什麼數字？而TACO又為何如此執著想看她的脖子，甚至因此吵架鬧分手？聽著故事的凱西，又跟這故事有什麼關連呢？“You look like someone I know.” Taco said this to a girl who named Cathy.She just missed the train. And he’s gonna tell her about a story about “Cathy”.His ex-girlfriends all have the same name-- “Cathy”. After breaking up with the first Cathy, each of them is like a different version of her. Or more specifically, since they all look the same, they are just like the duplicates of Cathy No.1.They never really leave. Whenever Taco gets dumped by one Cathy, there’ll be another one comes into his life.These girls all have a numeral tattoo on their neck. Except for Cathy No. 5, who never lets Taco see her neck no matter how much he attempts to.What exactly is on her neck? Why is Taco so obsess about it?And for the Cathy who is missing her train-- what does she have to do with Taco’s story?",
