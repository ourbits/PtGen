    "introduction": "Spanish director Antoni Verdaguer retells the stories of those living in the neighborhood of Raval, highlighting the woes of the immigrant community and their struggle to integrate. This docudrama portrays many lives that do not intersect yet are combined with the same despair of belonging to a community that continues to reject them. To name a couple of these characters, there is Aurelio, a man who converts to Islam to marry the love of his life, Moroccan Charazad, and who is rejected by his family. Javed, a Pakistani boy, is bullied at school and finds comfort in a resident couple who help him prepare a poem for a school performance. Unlike a movie that has a single plot where all characters meet at a certain point, Raval Raval still manages to stimulate the viewer and to create compassion with the characters.",
