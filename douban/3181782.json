    "introduction": "In an isolated corner of the country where nothing goes on, an ex-mobster and his rebellious step-daughter Coralie are looking for solutions to their finacial difficulties and existential stagnation. Desperate, troubled by the recent disappearance of the mother/wife, and surrounded by intimidating crooks, the duo tries to address their issues. Coralie is out for vengeance in a cruel and male-dominated world. Elle veut le chaos is a melodrama, populated with raw and dubious characters. A film filled with humour, where nothing seems to be happening on the surface, yet emotions are simmering inside.  Written by Atopia (from IMDB)",
