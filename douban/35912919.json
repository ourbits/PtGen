    "introduction": "From one tiny hatchling among thousands, we follow Brutus, a Saltwater Crocodile on his 50- year ascendancy to become top croc. Drawing on his great lineage, avoiding predation, defying challenges from rivals, making great ocean voyages, conquering a prime billabong, siring many offspring, Brutus reaches his zenith, only to become the most hunted croc in the Top End of Australia. Through his journey, we will have an intimate insight into the natural history of the saltwater crocodile, its behaviour and ecology.Producers: Bettina Dalton, Alan Erson, Michael Tear, Alexandre Soullier",
