    "introduction": "改编自罗马尼亚文学大师Ion Creanga的名著，本片是60年代罗马尼亚最经典的幻想片，由女导演Elisabeta Bostan执导，采用与捷克动画家karel zeman相似的真人+动画技术，所不同的是karel zeman的影片描写的是未来和科幻，而这部《风中王国》则表现的是罗马尼亚古老的民间神话。5+An intrepid young man journeys to a magical kingdom to discover the secret of life. One of the most sought-after of the live-action fairy tales, this Romanian production boasts incredible special effects in a magical universe you will not soon forget! This is the English-Language version released to Kiddie Matinees by Xerox Films.Very fine traditional and unusual fairy tale. i saw this movie dubbed in French as La Clé d'or... Elisabeta Bostan got friends with Quebec film maker and distributor Rock Demers. Faroun films is a Rock Demers distribution company he created in 1965 and wich distributed La Clé d'or in Quebec TV at the time. Rock Demers created then films La Fête, and together with other european film makers produced quite a big series of 'contes pour tous', still classics in Quebec (La guerre des Tuques, Opération beurre de pinottes, Aventuriers timbre perdu, etc....But this here movie was made in 68 in romania... and has the european coloration of fairy-tales produced at the time by Alexander Rou, and other russian and czech producers... It's is a great tale about the Truth and the PureHeart always winning over the King of Liars, and all that is against us in life : Time, Nature, etc... The sets are just artificial enough for a fantasy...that's what so good about these movies, no big fuss about special effects and all...the overall impression is just a litte 60's-kitsch tone with a very good scenario and great casting and makeup : ahhh the witch is so....a witch!!! A must-see and must-have movie....but very hard to find i would think.",
