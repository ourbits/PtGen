    "introduction": "A sideshow can be a magical place. For those who live and work there, it can be a safe haven. For Cleo (Anwen O’Driscoll, OCTOBER FACTION, BURDEN OF TRUTH), her role in the family-run exhibit is clear: as the 88th generation of proud, bearded women, she follows their legacy of sword-swallowing, and her overbearing mother, Lady Andre (Jessica Paré, MAD MEN, SEAL TEAM), wants Cleo to be an obedient daughter and stick with tradition. But outside the show tents of Paradise County is a big world, and when Cleo’s fresh ideas for their sword show aren’t embraced, and she clashes with her mother, she gets the itch to leave her talented fringe family to find love and perhaps a new normal that doesn’t include facial hair.The sideshow is also the target of greedy local business man Richard “Dick” Sutherland, played by Jeff Gladstone, who gave us a singular performance in last year’s Septentrion Shadows selection KRYPTIC. Lady Andre and the performers are left to fight the good fight to get his grimy hands off their land, as Cleo goes out into the world to learn life’s harder lessons with some unforgettable locals.",
