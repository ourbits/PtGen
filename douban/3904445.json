    "introduction": "孖生兄第Mario及Theo每星期都會去到英國不同的地方，品評一些正出售的豪宅，品評一下室內及室外的家居設計。在首集《大英豪宅》中，他們搜羅了三間外表看似古堡的大宅，但推門入來卻是十分先進、擁有開放式廚房，家居擺設更是高格調，顏色的配搭上也十分鮮明，而其中一間古堡大宅更擁有一個千幾呢的室內泳池、私人保齡球場等設施，簡直是大開眼界。Join the Nicolaou brothers on a quest to find the ideal home. Putting their own skills as an architect and an interior designer to good use, the duo pursue a particular type of property whether it's a place by the water or a country cottage, a high-rise apartment or a Georgian townhouse. Hunting downing the properties, they meet the people who are looking to buy and sell. As the shortlist is whittled down to three, how will the boys make the difficult choice of deciding which one is best?",
