    "introduction": "In 1972/73, sinologist & situationist René Viénet bought the rights to Tú Guāngqǐ's 1972 martial-arts movie Crush. Creative subtitling turned it into a burlesque comedy about daft French Maoists and street-smart Anarcho-Syndicalists. It became an instant success on its very limited first run. Then, a second version was made: the film was dubbed using the dialogues Viénet wrote for the subs, with a few congenial changes by the actors.Time passed, La dialectique peut-elle casser des briques? vanished from circulation, turning slowly into a half-remembered avant-garde myth whose distorted reality one could mainly encounter online in ultra-crappy compression. While digitally restoring his legacy and thinking about new projects after decades of silence, Viénet decided to make a third version by means of digitally rotoscoped moving watercolours! We proudly present the return of La dialectique peut-elle casser des briques? both in the rotoscopic and restored dubbed versions.",
