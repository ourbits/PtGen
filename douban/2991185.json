    "introduction": "Terrifying, bloody, suspenseful, brutal, ultra-explosive commando actioner from the Philippines! The American army forms a special squad of \"rats\" to fight the Vietcongs that use underground tunnels as their hideouts. Their leader is Yian Drom, a sadistic commander. Following their special training, they enter the deadly tunnels to exterminate the communists. An over-the-top viewing experience featuring non-stop violence, gunfights, explosions, yelling and cursing! Nobody is spared here, not even children, not even old people! Still a surprisingly solid and well-plotted film. Our fine-looking print is gloriously uncut and contains all the gore! Do not miss BATTLE RATS!",
