    "introduction": "Gisele believes her future depends solely on her. She has overcome so many obstacles in life that the dream of becoming an English teacher seems possible, and the future ahead—brilliant. Or, at least, that is how she phrases it in an essay for her postgraduate program application. However, Gisele, the filmmaker’s sister, is a tetraplegic who needs help with every simple task. She studies, swims, works out—she is stubborn. And even when it seems like her environment has nothing to offer her, or when her family is less than enthusiastic about her plans, she refuses to give up. Abílio Dias follows his sister in a beautiful intimate film that captures the light, gentleness, tenderness, and unwavering determination in Gisele’s life, with no trace of condescension or pity.源自：https://www.docaviv.co.il/2023-en/films/future-brilliant/",
