    "introduction": "Bionico is a hopeless romantic addicted to crack, who, along with Calvita, his drug partner, tries to find a job, a house, and a wedding ring to marry La Flaca, his fiancée. But most importantly, he must quit drugs and stay clean by the time she comes out of the rehabilitation center where she's detoxing, a mission impossible for him. It's a love story, a tale of failed relationships, and the importance of friendships.源自：https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/films/2196596",
