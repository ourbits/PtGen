    "introduction": "...after \"les amants de minuit\" a charming romantic story directed by Roger Richebé the precedent year.This one was directed by Marc Allégret who is essentially renowned for his pre WW2 work.The fifties were his brother Yves 's time (\"une si jolie petite plage\" \"manèges\")and by 1955,he had fallen into mediocrity (\"en effeuilllant la marguerite\" ,\" sois belle et tais-toi\").\"Julietta\" is a harmless little comedy(much less entertaining that \" les amants de minuit\")which is watchable only because of the three actors:Jean Marais,Dany Robin and Jeanne Moreau;the latter probably had the worst part of a brilliant career:she portrays here a snub squeamish yellow-bellied bourgeois whom Marais takes to his desirable property;the problem is that he has already taken in Robin before,and he has got to hide her from Moreau's jealousy.You can describe the plot as an endless hide-and -seek game.NB:Dany Robin's career ended with Hitchcock's \"Topaz\" (1969),but it was one of the master's worst works (it might actually be the worst).She tragically died in a fire in 1995.",
