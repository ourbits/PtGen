    "introduction": "Yasha and his friends all hang out at his house. Some of them are employed, some of them are weighing career options, and some of them aren't doing anything except joining the rest in bouts of drinking, listening to rock 'n roll, and doing drugs. They also get together to put on chicken fights in the courtyard. Meanwhile, Sanjan is trying to deal with his dying, alcoholic father and develop a relationship with Olya, who already has a boyfriend. The director of this film includes some surreal imagery in the mix, along with some (real) documentary interviews with people on the street responding to questions about how well they like their lives after Gorbachev's reforms.",
