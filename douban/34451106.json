    "introduction": "In the 1990s David Perlov returned to the format of the filmed diaries he produced between 1973 and 1983, organized in a different way, closer to the cinematographic essay, and divided into three thematic chapters, \"Sheltered Childhood\", \"Routine and Rituals\" and \"Back to Brazil\". In the first, we follow the childhood of his grandchildren; in the second, the political routine of Israel, the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, the rise of Benjamin Netanyahu and various rituals that make up the country's daily life; in the third, Perlov returns to Brazil, remaking, for the last time, his trips to Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Belo Horizonte.",
