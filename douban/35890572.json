    "introduction": "First of all I would like to say that I am very happy today. Despite my meager benefits and my brother's grim appearance, tonight I finally get a chance to come to terms with my brother. Humans are not made to be alone. Don't say a bad word about my brother. He can't help it either. Let's agree on that.In My brother and I, Pieter Verelst unleashes a barrage of stories from his absurd universe. Before you know it you are glued to his lips as he tells immensely visually about a farmer and a mole. Combine this with his energetic acting talent and musicality and you understand that this performance will fly by far too quickly.",
