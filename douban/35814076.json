    "introduction": "Anna is a bright, 35-year-old passionate teacher. When she returns earlier than planned from a holiday in France that she has spent with her mother and sister, she seems utterly distraught. For her partner Noe, it is not directly clear what has happened to her, and when she asks, she does not get the whole story. Little by little, we find out that Anna was subversively – but forcefully – put on a diet by her family. Coming from a wealthy, highly educated background, Anna’s heavy overweight does not match the idea her mother has of the family. Over the course of a year, we see how the events that took place in France affect Anna’s life. We observe a family entangled in their obligations and dependence towards each other, and a woman who is demanding acknowledgment and autonomy.",
