    "introduction": "This is a new version of the “Cherry Orchard” by Anton Chekhov, in our opinion, comes as closed as it possible up to the author’s message, who was utterly unsatisfied by the production of this play in his lifetime.In letters he wrote: “My play goes now, I don’t wait a particular success, business is rotten”. “Yesterday there was my play, that is why I am off my feed” or “Does “The Cherry Orchard” up till then is mine “Cherry Orchard”?...All of this is not mine really, this is a humdrum ordinary existence, but not a tiresome whimpering, makes me either sniveler or simply a boring writer, and I wrote several tomes of jolly stories. But criticism puts me in some sort of snivelers!”",
