    "introduction": "This movie is the best portrait of Chilean society. Ruiz show us like a group of little people with little problems, with a very special way of life. The strangest Spanish in all South American with the funniest accent too. This movie is like Martin Scorsese's Mean Street but without the crime ingredient. You must see it if you wanna know what's to be a Chilean, how you can feel believing that you're in the center of the world but actually living in the end, almost hanging from the continent. Raul Ruiz right now is living in Paris and making the most bizarre but fascinating films of the french production. \"Tres tristes tigres\" is very difficult to find but if you can, i tell you that you'll have a real gem.",
