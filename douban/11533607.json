    "introduction": "One of the greatest and funniest comedies of the Restoration, The Country Wife tells the story of Horner, a first-class rake, who devises a brilliant scheme to lure in the fine married ladies of London society under their husbands' noses. But Horner (Anthony Andrews) soon meets his match when he becomes involved with Margery Pinchwife (Helen Mirren - love the freckles!), an innocent newlywed from the country whose pathologically jealous husband is played by Bernard Cribbens. The Country Wife is filled with the wit and humour that are typical of bawdy Restoration comedy, and it is considered one of the best from that period.",
