    "introduction": "Six rappers have rewritten Cuban history and sparked a lyric battle for human rights through a song called “Patria y Vida.” The song has become a revolution in the streets of Cuba and the world, being banned by the government, and imprisoning people just for listening to it. Osorbo, one of the rappers, is in a high security prison because during the massive protests of July 11th, 2021, “Patria y Vida” was the loudest cry heard from the crowd. Meanwhile, Yotuel, the other rapper, is forced into exile. This Grammy “Song of the Year” protest anthem expresses the struggle of independent artists trying to give a voice to repressed peoples.",
