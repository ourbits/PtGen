    "introduction": "The great actress Norma Reyes (76), desperate to work, accepts a minor role in a very commercial and tacky play: a great-grandmother with Alzheimer's disease opposite a very popular, up and coming actress. The script is mediocre and the rehearsals a disaster. At the same time, her daughter Celeste (28), a playwright who has been constantly overshadowed by her mother's career, announces that she will get married and move out. Despite the stress of the premiere and the fact that her daughter will abandon her, Norma pushes herself to go on; until an unexpected incident puts Celeste's plans on hold giving mother and daughter the opportunity to rebuild the relationship from scratch.",
