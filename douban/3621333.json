    "introduction": "The justices heard arguments in a free-speech case over a 2008 documentary, shown in theaters, that was sharply critical of the onetime presidential candidate and current secretary of state.At issue was whether the 90-minute \"Hillary: The Movie\" and television ads to promote it should have been subject to strict campaign finance laws on political advocacy or should have been seen as a constitutionally protected form of commercial speech.The high court's decision will determine whether politically charged documentaries can be regulated by the government in the same way as traditional campaign commercials.A ruling is expect by late June.",
