    "introduction": "It seems that the US version differs from the European one. Anyhow we are talking about a great movie. Inspector Henry Silva is accused of having killed a police informer and is kicked out of the Department. He will have to do all by himself to discover the truth.The ace of this movie is director Miraglia who manages to make a wonderful direction. Everything is no nice to see, even when Inspector Sterling is simply moving from one room of his house to another. The images are clear and full of light. The atmosphere is tense. The music is great. Beba Loncar is the mysterious blonde that Sterling will have to tail in order to solve his case. Keenan Wynn is the harsh (but comprehensive) chief inspector. Pier Paolo Capponi is the journalist that will try to get a scoop from the surprising epilogue. All these ingredients are magnificently blended in a beautiful San Francisco!",
