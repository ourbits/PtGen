    "introduction": "An experimental film from the co-director of acclaimed \"Kapi, Vode, Ratnici\". Very dark and surreal imagery, interesting, unusual camera work.Almost no plot. First half of the film displays a girl trapped behind some walls. She stumbles around trying to find a way out, and to see what's going on in the outer world.Her frustration grows as she cannot find a way out.Then she suddenly sees a man literally walking through a wall...No sound. Although the original had sound, at the beginning of the film there is a title card saying: \"Sound of this film has not been preserved\".",
