    "introduction": "Nate Silver is America's rock star statistician. He shot to fame by correctly predicting the outcome of the last two American presidential elections, state by state. Now Panorama has had exclusive access to him as he comes to the UK to try and forecast the outcome of the most uncertain British election in decades. Reporter Richard Bacon takes Nate on a road trip around the country, meeting voters of all political hues and backgrounds, from the rolling hills of Devon to the pier at Skegness. Ten days before polling day, can he tell us which way it will go?",
