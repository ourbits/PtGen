Her freedom comes with a daunting price. Anna is dispatched to the hydroelectric town of Notodden to spy on Adam Honderich, a German High Church Lutheran Minister/Priest suspected of resistance activities. Conflicted by the moral ambiguity of her situation, but given only three days to succeed, she must survive sudden obstacles, the brutality of war, gestell, rapidly shifting cultures, all while seeking some final hope of redemption. The Minister/Priest goes fishing.",
