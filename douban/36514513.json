    "introduction": "A new work by director Igarashi Kohei, widely known for The Night I Swam. Sano revisits the hotel where he first met his wife five years ago, searching for traces of his deceased wife. He harbors a vain hope of finding the red cap he bought her, but not only is the hat gone, the hotel is also scheduled to close soon. The film connects the present and the past through the song “Beyond the Sea” that his wife loved, telling a beautiful story that can only be seen from a third-person perspective, unknown to the protagonist. The wife, the cap, and the hotel all disappear, but some things live on forever. The film deals with the traces of time that are too small to be noticed but that do exist. Especially in the moment when their first meeting in the past is summoned from the present. Struggling with the pain of loss, the film demonstrates how cinematic magic can revive time.",
