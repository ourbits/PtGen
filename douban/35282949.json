    "introduction": "The rivers of Africa burst with life- invigorating the landscape and providing a bounty for the animals that depend on them for their survival. The seven mighty rivers punctuate the seasons and shape the lives of everything they touch. Whether these rivers are in flow or in retreat, life must still go on- for the animals every dry season is a test of their strength but when the rains pour and the rivers flow they bring with them a time of birth and renewal- for where there is water- there is life.",
