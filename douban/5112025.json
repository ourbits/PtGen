    "introduction": "Vidheyan, the cinematic adaptation of the novel Bhaskara Pattelarum Ente Jeevithavum by Malayalam writer Paul Zacharia explores the master-slave dialectic in a South Karnataka setting.To exercise absolute power one also needs the subservient. In the film, Thommi never says 'no' to the abuse of power that is unleashed on him. He simply submits and accepts it as something natural. He fears it, and accommodates it alternately.Thommy, a Christian migrant labour from Kerala is an obedient slave of his aggressive, tyrannical landlord Bhaskara Pattelar. Thommy obeys all the orders of his master, whether it is to make his own wife sexually available to his master or in killing Pattelar's kindly wife, Saroja. When Pattelar escapes to a jungle, due to his own deeds, Thommy escorts him like a pet. But when Pattelar gets killed Thommy exults in freedom.Vidheyan won the State Film awards for best film and best director for Adoor Gopalakrishnan. Mammooty won the National Film award for best actor for this film in 1993.",
