    "introduction": "Emilia is a young psychiatrist living in Buenos Aires with her boyfriend. She has a steady life but is not fully satisfied. She receives an invitation to go back to 28 de Noviembre, her hometown in Patagonia to spread Andrea's ashes, Emilia's best friend who died five years earlier. Emilia pauses her life in the city and travels for the ceremony. The cold and the snow of the hard winter in southern Argentina are the setting of her journey to the past. There, she revisits her friendship with dead Andrea and mourns her with her family. On the isolated routs of Patagonia, Emilia meets Julián, her first love, who has recently become a father.",
