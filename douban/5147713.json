The day's mayor sings a challenge to her lieutenants and they respond in close harmony that they'll make the city pretty. Then they rush to the train station to meet opera singer Madame Beverly. At the station, they ask for help, prompting the woman at the information booth to sing, \"Information Please.\" A chorus line taps their way around the station. Madame Beverly arrives and sings, \"I Love to Sing a Whole Note.\" Then, at a unique reception at City Hall, the Mayor gives Madame Beverly the key to the city, and they reprise the three songs.",
