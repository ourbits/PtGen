Kevin is new in youth prison. He has to share a cell with Tommy, Andy and Marc. A partnership of convenience in a system where only the strong prevail. It is hard for Kevin to establish himself. He's afraid of not sticking it out. Only Tommy gives him an amicable advice: In this system, you're either a victim or a culprit. An advice that will trigger most dire consequences and will lead to a night that will change the lives of the four inmates forever.",
