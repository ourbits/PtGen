    "introduction": "Redemption follows a winding course in this mystical road movie that incidentally unfolds as an ode to Americana on the back lanes and farms of rural Wisconsin. When an obsessed would-be lover commits suicide, Mara (Veit) is transformed by a guilt that reduces her to a barefoot penitent trekking dirty and homeless toward a hazy goal. An odd young man declares her a saint. Soon she has followers and miracles are proclaimed, but Mara has yet to discover that her alleged powers come from a dark place. BAREFOOT TO JERUSALEM was the final film of award-winning director (THE JUNIPER TREE) and University of Wisconsin film professor Keene, only recently completed by her collaborators following her 2004 death.
