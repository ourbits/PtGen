    "introduction": "The two friends in this story have enough trouble in their lives as it is, and yet they decide to hit neighboring Azerbaijan for cheap drugs. One turn of the road wrongly taken, and the guys are in the territory of Mountain Karabakh, a hot-spot of Armenian – Azerbaijani military conflict. Fallen prisoners of partisans, the youths take everything happening around them with stoic calm... An Aka Morchalidze's ditto novel was turned into the film Trip to Karabakh. A consciously chaotic, jagged narrative has been the director's choice of means to convey this story of experience of being young in contemporary Georgia, its evenly humorous tone setting off all the more poignantly the tragic absurdity of events evolving in its neighboring region.Levan Tutberidze (Georgia, 1959) is an actor, director, founder of Georgia's first independent film studio AISI and the film center Amirani. Graduated from the State Institute of Theater and Cinematography of Georgia in 1982. Trip to Karabakh brought director a FIPRESCI award in 2005; cites as his principal inspirations the great Georgians Otar Joseliani and Tengiz Abuladze.",
