    "introduction": "High school and university students, a teacher or a gigolo meet in a vacant warehouse that is turning into a film studio. They will reenact scenes from the life of former Romanian President Nicolae Ceaușescu. His fight against fascism, joining the Communist Party, his imprisonment and his trial. The more intensely the actors get into their roles, the more they reveal about themselves during the breaks in filming. Together with the profile of the communist leader as a young man, this creates a collective portrait of contemporary Romanian youth, their value priorities and their relationship with history in an experimental space between fiction and documentary.",
