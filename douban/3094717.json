    "introduction": "A darkly comic look at a group of self-absorbed, twenty-something New Yorkers grappling with personal crises on New Year's Eve 1999, this film provokes discussions about the very meaning of the new millennium, adding a dose of ironic, self-referential commentary. Indeed, \"Why do we care about the new millennium?\" is one of the questions raised. Apart from a few flashbacks, the action takes place on the momentous eve in question at the Greenwich Village apartment of the fastidious Andrew Goldman. His guests include Andrew's uptight father Harold, assertive lesbian Suki, insecure singer Sylvia, adolescent bookworm Danny, enigmatic sage Goat Man, and the central character, the self-pitying, neurotic Rufus Wild. Deciding to end his relationship with loving girlfriend Annabell so he can start fresh in the new millennium, Rufus passively forces a break-up only hours before the party, but insists they both go anyway. At Andrew's place, Rufus spies Nicole, the woman he's been lusting over for some time, and determines to confess his feelings to her. But even Rufus realizes he's a heel, as he reveals in a biting internal monologue that accompanies a black-and-white flashback. Cutting back and forth among the characters' various dilemmas sets the stage for a tension-mounting climax that inter-weaves suicidal ideation, lustful fantasies and 11th-hour decisions",
