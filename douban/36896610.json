The race pits them both against formidable opponents from their past, each with plans to inexorably remove religion's influence on public policy. Set against a backdrop of unprecedented political, civil and spiritual unrest, Dave struggles to answer an increasingly relevant question of our time: Is God dead in American politics?",
