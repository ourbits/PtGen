    "introduction": "BBC One’s acclaimed daytime series Moving On, created by multi-award-winning writer Jimmy McGovern, is returning to BBC One and BBC iPlayer for its eleventh series this March, with five powerful and moving new dramas.Important, contemporary issues - from homophobia in sport to prison tags and the nuances of redundancy - are woven into the stories of five ordinary people who have reached a crossroads in their life.In episode two, penned by writer Mandy Redvers Rowe, who is blind, EastEnders’ star Kacey Ainsworth plays Vicky, a woman who has her sight restored - with unforeseen consequences for her and her family.Mark Addy (The Full Monty, A Knight’s Tale, White House Farm) stars in Man Of Steel as rugby league legend Josh, a much-loved local hero who is being blackmailed by his ex-wife; while in Redundant Julie Graham (Shetland, Being Eileen, Survivors) plays Pauline, a woman who won’t be cowed - even when her life is in the hands of a management consultant…Neve McIntosh (Shetland, Doctor Who, Bodies) is a bereaved mother who forms an attachment to a young homeless man in the heartbreaking Home, while in Time Out Tom McKay (Imagine Me & You, Kingdom Come: Deliverance) negotiates a new life and a new relationship - compromised by his prison tag.Jimmy McGovern, the series’ creator, says: “For over a decade, Moving On has brought authentic and thought-provoking drama to a daytime audience, utilising the talents of both A-list actors and new and established writers and directors to tell stories concerning extraordinary moments in ordinary people’s lives.“This latest series is no exception, and I’m sure viewers will thoroughly enjoy the five brilliant stories that our remarkable team has put together.”Dan McGolpin, Controller, Programming & Daytime, says: “Jimmy McGovern’s Moving On is returning with five original and affecting stories written, directed and performed by a fantastically talented group of people. Viewers on BBC One and BBC iPlayer won’t be disappointed, this is one of the best series so far.”Colin McKeown, founder and producer at LA Productions, adds: “We’re once again very proud of the team we’ve assembled for the latest series of Moving On. Whether industry veterans or newcomers, they’ve all been exceptional in bringing these powerful stories to life, and I can’t wait to share these five new episodes with audiences.”Since its launch in 2009, Moving On has attracted some of the UK’s leading performers to bring challenging and thought-provoking drama to daytime television.The five stand-alone episodes will air from Monday 2 March until Friday 6 March on BBC One Daytime, and on BBC iPlayer.All five new episodes were filmed on location across Merseyside and produced by Liverpool-based LA Productions.",
