One night they take an old grumpy man's car to couple of streets away. In the middle of the night, when they are hotwiring the car, the old man's heart can't take it. Thus, their short journey now leads them to somewhere unknown. One thing leads to another, now Yılmaz and Müjdat have to put the old man's dead body into a thinner solvent tank. The duo keeps painting the cars in their shop but they realize that the thinner they take from the tank with the dead body is giving amazing results. That \"a couple of streets away\" now leads to something really odd.",
