    "introduction": "In the Eyptian collection in Munich, Hick is cleaning the statue of Osiris with soap and hand towels; he dries the figure's head with a hair-dryer and puts cream on it. Hick wants a favour from the deity-a rendezous with the Egyptian queen Hatshepsut. A mummy climbs out of its sarcophays, starts to move by itself and, a little stiff about the hips, leaves the museum. Osiris, presented ironically as the god of the sleepy heads, is also the ruler of the underworld; his servant Hick first has to enter the afterlife if his request is to be fulfilled. The bite of a snake, a symbol of the Fall of Man and of the healing Aesculapius, sends him to the hereafter. Hick comes back as one of the un-dead and proceeds to search for the Eygptian queen. Again and again the mummy appears near him, and finally they meet in the Hofbrauhaus, where everyone is haveing a qruesomely jolly time and the beer steins are bursting on the heads of the guests. The two of them return to the Hofgarten, in front of the doors of the Egyptain Collection. Hick unwraps the mummy and at last the sought-after Hatshepsut is standing before him. She wants to go back into the museum again, because she has forgotten her handbag. Will she come back to Hick?",
