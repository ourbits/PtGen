    "introduction": "A director makes a film about her family in the little village Villereau in northern France, just by the border to Belgium. She follows what happens in the village during a time of severe crisis, where lack of information creates fear, paranoia and excesses among the villagers and her family. Based on the award winning short documentary Excess Will Save Us, the universe established in that film expands into a feature hybrid film depicting life in the countryside at a time of fundamental crisis in Europe and the Western world. This new account will retain its humor and visual force, but give a deeper understanding of the people that live there and the meaning of returning.",
