He has to make a choice: should he live a predictable life in his remote Himalayan village or migrate to the city? Working in a café and witnessing migrations and reverse-migrations, he has disturbed sleep and nightmares. Sometimes he has visions while awake-flashes of fleeting but strong images. The film looks at the aspirations, fears, and insecurities of living in present times through Kishan's eyes.",
