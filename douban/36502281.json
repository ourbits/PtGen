    "introduction": "From now on, the story we will encounter will be a story that no-one knows, or a story that no-one has heard yet. Gi-eun and Gi-un, who live their lives in bed due to spinal disorders, have been trapped in dreams every day since the side effects of medication began to plunge them into deep sleep. Unable to move freely, in their dreams, they become stuntmen or artists, experiencing lives they have never lived before and freely exploring various parts of the world, embarking on journeys to places they have never been to.In order to forget the pain of reality, they consume even stronger medication but vomit it up, blurring the line between dreams and reality. Within the days where dreams become reality and reality becomes a dream, they transcend the limits of their physical bodies and, at some point, fall into a journey towards their deepest inner selves. It is a peculiar and beautiful journey for people who, instead of physical freedom, may have found true freedom of the mind.(MO Eun-young)源自：https://www.bifan.kr/eng/program/program_view.asp?pk_seq=6560&sc_category_seq=6022&sc_num=1&amp;actEvent=view",
