    "introduction": "When I was 13 I came across a pulp novel titled Doctor Tin. There is a scene in part 2 of that novel that casually starts with the protagonist being uncuffed from a bathtub where he was serving as \"toilet slave\" for a party for the evening.That book changed my life, or at least crimped it in a few novel directions.Blood is based on a stage play written by Tom Walmsley, author of Doctor Tin.  Here in Canada, he is to theater what David Cronenberg is to cinema (though he is obviously not as famous). This movie was directed by Jerry Ciccoritti who is also known for his vampire movie Graveyard Shift, made in 1987",
