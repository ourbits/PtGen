    "introduction": "“While Lucrezia Lerro, one of the two narrators, talks about the ‘case’ of Osip Mandelstam, I read from the diary of Mikhail Koltsov on the arrival of the writers for the congress, as well as all the other captions of Frente a Guernica. This is the film that Angela Ricci Lucchi and I conceived and made together. Today I am keeping, once again, the promise I made to Angela, that of continuing our political, artistic and historical work on the violence of the 20th century.” Yervant Gianikian源自：https://doclisboa.org/2023/en/filmes/frente-a-guernica/",
