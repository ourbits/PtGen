Each family has a strong patriarch but being the leader of an organized crime family comes with a very high price. This is war and casualties will be your wife, your children or even yourself. All rules are being violated and everyone is a target. Old friends are now enemies, families are divided and new family bonds are being formed. Once the gunfire has ceased and the bodies have been found the Judge and the jury will make their call but only God can decide which family will still be around.",
