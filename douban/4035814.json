    "introduction": "The series followed a group of young doctors, male and female, just out of school and beginning their first practical stint in a hospital. All the characters were likable and well-played. One or two initially verged on stereotypes, but as the show progressed, all were fleshed out to a point that this was no longer an issue. Various relationships developed within the group, which, unfortunately, were not given a chance to fully resolve themselves within the two seasons of the run.",
