    "introduction": "There are elegant ladies as well as poor pensioners among them. Burdened with shopping bags, day and night, regardless of the weather and time of the year, they visit parks, cemeteries and secluded places. These are ‘cat ladies’, considered as weirdos by some and angels of good by others. Maybe these women feeding homeless cats are trying to fill an empty space in their lives or satisfy their maternal instincts. Before the camera they philosophize, sing old songs and tell stories of love, fear and lost opportunities. One character argues with her husband with whom she shares nothing but a love of cats. They all speak of their pets with fondness and affection and have a name for each of them. Łoziński has managed to paint a portrait of women who have found an aim at the end of their lives.",
