At least, he knows exactly how to benefit from the already collapsing system of the Soviet Union. He takes every opportunity to make a profit. Frantisek has no problem with stealing expensive gravestones from cemeteries and selling them as construction material or importing digital watches while  exporting stolen antiquities. The same-age incorrupt investigator Cajthami is willing to stop the crook, but has to face the fact, that his enemy already made friends within the police and communist party. A cat-and-mouse game starts, which lasts even after the fall of the Iron Curtain, and Frantisek makes for the future – a future full of money,",
