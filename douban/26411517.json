    "introduction": "The siblings Sam and Minna and their mother Eva arrive to the Orchid coast to celebrate Christmas in the sun with aunt Anja and their cousin Bianca. It's the first time after their father's death the siblings are back on his beloved Orchid coast, and it is in the same time both beautiful and sad to be there. It promises to be an exciting Christmas when a mysterious mask and old pieces of wood from a sunken ship washes ashore at the hotel where they live. Grandfather Ivo tells the three cousins the legend of pirate Aquila, whose ship sank in the battle for \"the greatest treasure of them all\". Meanwhile Sam, Minna and their mother Eva learns that the Orchid coast will be destroyed after Christmas. Can pirate Aquila's treasure save the coast?- Written by Karin Gidfors (translated by Filippa Torstensson)",
