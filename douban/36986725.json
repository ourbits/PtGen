    "introduction": "Venice from 4 a.m. tells the story of a number of workers and artists based in the lagoon, starting from sunrise to sunset to midnight. The film is structured in ten chapters, each of which depicts specific Venetian craftsmanship, the city’s celebratory spirit, maintenance, and services. In the first part, the characters and their workplaces are introduced to the audience without narration. In the second part, we revisit the characters and get to know their stories on a deeper level, this time, accompanied by interviews and narration. The atmosphere of Christmas and New Year is also shown along with the performance of a choir orchestra. In the last part, old photos of the city of Venice are shown in juxtaposition with new images of people, alongside the recitation of an old Italian poem narrated by Michael Sfrizzo. Finally, the cemetery of the city of Venice, together with the voice of Mohammad-Reza Shajarian, the greatest Iranian singer and master of Persian traditional music, adds to the dramatic atmosphere of the image.",
