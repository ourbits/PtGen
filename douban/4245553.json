    "introduction": "Voulgaris has taken a novel, Plague by Andreas Frangulia and adapted it to tell an almost autobiographical story of life on a remote Aegean island used as a political prison under the Colonels. He says he has not aimed for an effect of documentary realism. \"What I hoped to do, was to find a way of creating my own language, using the light and space of Greece, the roots I have here. The challenge to my generation is to rid ourselves of forces and trend outside Greece.\"\"Happy day is a visually powerful, strangely elliptical work, disturbing in its understated images of man's inhumanity to man,\" (Sydney Film Festival)",
