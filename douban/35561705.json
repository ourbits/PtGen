    "introduction": "BAD BLOOD follows three generations of one family, tracing their financial, moral and physical decline. Trifun, the wealthy leader of a Christian minority, represents the first generation of the family. His personal drama is reflected in his struggle to meet moral and social standards despite his personal weakness, which leads him to decisions that have disastrous impact on his family. His son, Mita, does not want to participate in his father’s dirty dealings. Class struggle is the defining feature of his generation. After losing his wealth, Mita is forced to marry off his daughter Sofka in order to survive. She faces utter financial and moral ruin. Although she is burdened by the sins of her forefathers, Sofka attempts to rise above the social and historic troubles of her generation, and decides to run away with her son in search of a better future, leaving behind the ruins of her family.",
