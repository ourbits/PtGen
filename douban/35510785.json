She has next to nothing, but she shares it with him. He returns what was taken from her.（Berlinale Shorts）The revolution is over, but outlaws in the arid Chaco still harass the poor. An old woman reluctantly welcomes a lone gaucho. Her hospitality leads to a genuine connection after they share their hardships and injustices.（NATIVe - Indigenous Cinema）",
