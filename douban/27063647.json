In the process the commentary provides an overview of many aspects of Alexander’s career.The program follows Alexander’s “footsteps” in Egypt through the work of a number of contemporary archaeologists. There is a good deal of archaeology and historical methodology on display as well.Anyone one interested in Alexander’s life and times, Hellenism or later Egyptian history, or archaeology, will find this an interesting program.Denis Mootz",
