    "introduction": "The music video opens to a video of a crocodile scaring a herd of antelope. It then cuts to a scene where 2-D wakes up and changes clothes in 212 Wobble Street, London, SW21 7QJ. He exits his room and checks another one, finding other band member Noodle fast asleep. After that, he looks in a bathroom and finds a masked figure representing André 3000, surrounded by light blue-skinned \"sweat collectors\". Disgusted, 2-D looks in another room that turns out to be shrouded in complete darkness with the sounds of sheep, chickens and a man crying, which in turn is a reference to a Motorola commercial which band member Murdoc appeared in. The video for \"DoYaThing\" was directed by Jamie Hewlett and was released on 29 February 2012.",
