    "introduction": "The Guardian is a story about a mountain man and his struggle to save the forests of the Rugova Mountain from over-logging and environmental destruction. As we learn the stories of his youth, growing up in those mountains with his brother, we begin to understand the history behind Fatos' frustration with post-war politics, his sense of refuge in the mountains, and ultimately, his spiritual connection and dedication to preserving them.",
