    "introduction": "An emotional and inspirational rollercoaster ride, CALIBRATE won the Audience Award at the Awareness Film Festival (USA) for good reason. Directed by Academy Award Nominee Steve Pasvolsky, the film follows a cast of brave and diverse patients from around the globe as they attempt to 'heal themselves' from catastrophic injury and health conditions. After traditional medicine failed them, they converge on the NeuroPhysics Clinic in the hills above the Gold Coast, Australia, to be treated by former Mr.Universe Ken Ware. Despite no formal medical training, Ken has studied the body for 30 years and found an astounding link between Chaos Theory and the body's ability to heal itself. His method is put to the test by Manchester Bombing survivor Martin Hibbert, Australian bull-riding champion Sam O'Connor and World Dwarf Games athlete Meredith Young. All have one thing in common - a burning desire to walk again.",
