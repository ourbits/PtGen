    "introduction": "After Hick failed in the movie 'Die Atlantikschwimmer' he finally managed to travel to the USA. He is on the road, travelling through the many different landscapes, through Wyoming, Kansas, the Rocky Mountains, and finally gets to the Pacific Coast. While travelling he is philosphising about the indian genocide, the monstrous violence which was necessary to opress the indians and ruin their culture, and the fact, that it's only peaceful inside one's own country because the violent conflicts are fought abroad. It appears to him the USA is only such a peaceful country today because they run riot only outside their borders",
