    "introduction": "\"Facing the Laughter: Minnie Pearl\" is a full-length documentary about the life and work of Sarah Cannon, aka Minnie Pearl. Sarah was a serious, educated woman who had once dreamed of becoming a Shakespearean actress, but she found fame playing a simple country girl who often made herself the butt of her jokes. Instantly identifiable - even in silhouette - by her straw hat with a price tag dangling from its brim, Minnie Pearl became an icon of country music radio, stage and TV. When she greeted audiences, they enthusiastically echoed her signature \"Howdee\" in a happy roar. While Sarah and Minnie were two sides of a coin, they share a legacy of compassion, empowerment and humor.",
