    "introduction": "\"Praia\" is essentially an observational film that paints a unique portrait of early 21st century Copacabana Beach (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Between 2014 and 2016, Guilherme B. Hoffmann filmed day-to-day life on one of the world's most famous beaches as a one-man team, recording everyday conversations uttered by an assortment of visitors to special celebrations like the World Cup and New Year's Eve. This period was marked by a major political crisis in Brazil that made itself known even in moments of leisure. Inspired by the premise, \"we know too much about relevant things\" (Giovanni Levi), the film depicts ordinary people as they share this dynamic and beautiful public space.",
