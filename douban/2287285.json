    "introduction": "Summer Heights High is an Australian television mockumentary created and performed by comedian Chris Lilley. It is a satirical parody of high school life epitomized by its three lead characters, effeminate and vain drama teacher Mr. G, self-absorbed, precocious teenager Ja'mie King and disobedient, vulgar Tongan student Jonah Takalua. It lampoons Australian high school life and many aspects of the human condition and is filmed in a documentary style, with amateur actors acting as supporting characters.",
