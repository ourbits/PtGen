The leader of the squatter settlement is ready to negotiate, knowing that an eviction will not happen without blood. Suspecting a betrayal, the dwellers voice their concern. SIN MUERTOS NO HAY CARNAVAL portrays the city of Guayaquil through all its social strata, full of latent tensions that can only be resolved through violence. SIN MUERTOS NO HAY CARNAVAL (2016) is Sebastián Cordero's sixth feature film. It's an Ecuadorian-Mexican- German co-production, entirely shot on location in Guayaquil, Ecuador.",
