Shoo is sent to a remote village to care for an agoraphobic woman, who fears both the neighbours and the Na Sídhe – sinister folkloric entities that she believes abducted her decades before. As the pair develop a deep connection, Shoo becomes consumed by the old woman’s paranoia, rituals and superstitions, eventually confronting the horrors from her own past.",
