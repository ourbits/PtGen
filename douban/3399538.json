    "introduction": "THE RESCUERS uncovers the largely unknown stories of 13 heroic and courageous diplomats who, at tremendous personal cost, saved tens of thousands of Jews during World War II.  The film follows Stephanie Nyombayire, a young Rwandan anti-genocide activist who lost 100 members of her family in the Rwandan Genocide of the 1990s, and Sir Martin Gilbert, the renowned 20th century and Holocaust historian, as they travel across 15 countries and three continents interviewing survivors and descendants of the diplomats.  Nyombayire and Gilbert explore and contemplate the past in a quest, in part, to understand what should be done to stop the genocide that continues in parts of the world even today.Best Documentary, Palm Beach International Film Festival, 2011Best of the Fest, Palm Beach International Film Festival, 2011Best Documentary, Beloit International Film Festival, 2011",
