    "introduction": "Takes a critical look at the institutionalization of childbirth practices in Western society. Filmed from the point of view of the mother and baby, commentary by Dr. R.D. Laing raises questions as to the immediate and long-term effects of many of the detached, routine procedures that are so often out of tune with the feelings of mothers and babies at a time of their greatest vulnerability.",
