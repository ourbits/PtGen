    "introduction": "Warsaw by night, a restaurant by the river. Ojka, young and beautiful “call girl” runs out to the parking lot. Lured by her charm, an aging politician follows her. He doesn’t realize, that Ojka is only a bait, and he himself is in a few minutes going to die. That's how Warsaw Dark begins, a political thriller with a strong erotic motive.This film features a world where business pervades politics, there are no fair rules of the game, and anyone who has entered this matrix is marked forever. To some, this world will be a story in its own right, and to others, however, merely a backdrop of a big love. The plot is based on the sensational, authentic, yet so far unresolved case of the mysterious murder of Jacek D?bski, the one-time boss of he Polish Ministry of Sports and Tourism, in 2001.",
