Helen Lambin got her first tattoo at the age of 75. 86 year-old James Haake is the world's oldest working drag queen. After 40 years, Zillah Minx's band is still as punk as it's ever been, and Stephen Leafloor is turning his decades-long passion for hip-hop into a powerful tool for change. Their stories are Radical Age, a documentary that proves it's never too late to defy convention.",
