    "introduction": "The young teenagers Raphaël and Rémi are twins, but they aren’t the same. At the skatepark, Rémi has fun with his friends, while Raphaël is often alone. Yet they are very attached to each other. Raphael’s intellectual disability will cause their paths to diverge as they grow older. But now they are camping together again, in the woods by a lake.In her first documentary, Justine Martin needs few words to show the affection between the brothers and their growing awareness of inevitable change. A short interview with each of them is enough to give extra depth to her sympathetic, apparently simple, yet always telling observations of the high-spirited twins, as they roughhouse with each other and have fun, or share moments that show their closeness. With the Canadian landscape as a timeless background, emotion can be revealed in a subtly changing smile.源自：https://www.idfa.nl/en/film/0e35791d-527e-450e-8520-972bdf72e00b/oasis",
