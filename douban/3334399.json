    "introduction": "瑞士洛迦诺国际电影节银帆奖。Set during World War II at a train station, this interesting wartime drama by noted Polish filmmaker Kazmierz Kutz revolves around a group of people who need to escape the approaching German Gestapo unit. After the train leading to a safer haven stops at one station, two of its passenger cars have to be detached, leaving one group of passengers stranded. The German station master realizes that these people will have to board a train and get out of there soon. As the drama unfolds, some people try to help and others do not. Meanwhile, the Germans are getting closer and closer.Kutz's next film, LUDZIE Z POCIAGU / NIGHT TRAIN (1961), was based on a short story by Marian Brandys and once again featured a realistic stylistic. The film was effectively a portrait of a group of people who find themselves stuck in train station in German-occupied Poland. Each character reacts differently to the situation of horrific captivity that the group faces when the Germans threaten to execute every fifth traveler in the waiting room if a pistol stolen from a German railroad guard is not found. The observational realism of this film was in no way superficial and illustrated real moral dilemmas. Kutz's initial films contrasted with those of the famed \"Polish School\" of film of the time. In his works he observed everyday life, rendering it in a manner that was quite distant from grand ideas and Romantic martyrology.http://www.culture.pl/en/culture/artykuly/os_kutz_kazimierz",
