    "introduction": "\"It's a story of wild & exotic love. It's a story of tribal kings and opium trade. It's a story of kidnapping and loss. It's a story of sexual discovery, of spirits and magic. It's a story of government propaganda vs. the fascinating yet harrowing reality of the people.\" Far up in Vietnam's remote mountains, once a year, a secretive Love Market is held. Delving beyond the ambiguous myths, this unique, independently produced adventure documentary discovers a reality much more fascinating, even if painful, than the legends told.",
