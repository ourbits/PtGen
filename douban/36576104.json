    "introduction": "Erin Allen (Hutton) is a single mother to her football-loving 12-year-old daughter, Kiera (Sophia Powers, \"Unexpected Grace\"), who plays in the town's junior flag football league. At Keira's football practice, Erin runs into the coach's brother and professional football player, Mike Hanson (Paevey). Erin and Mike are blindsided - they were college sweethearts. Mike is visiting his brother, Jimmy (Dan Payne, \"Outrunners\"), while healing from a football injury that diminishes his chances of achieving his dream of finally getting a championship ring. When Jimmy gets the call to coach the high school team, Mike steps up as the flag football coach. As Erin and Mike spend time together, old sparks are rekindled despite Erin's hesitance. Right before the championship game, Mike receives good news but also an unsettling truth while Erin learns to go after what she wants - and they both learn to follow their hearts.",
