    "introduction": "During the last century, the world's endangered species have become increasingly threatened with various factors that may push them to extinction sooner than expected. But there could be a future for them, as Animal Planet's new series - 'Baby Planet' - reveals that their future rests on the shoulders of the females and the dedicated people who look after them and their babies. Through access in both key wilderness areas and the world's top breeding institutions, 'Baby Planet' celebrates the animal baby-boom happening around the world. Travel with Animal Planet to zoos and wildlife parks around the world to witness the major efforts that keepers are taking to help keep these species alive. From working closely with vets and biologists to achieve more successful births, to monitoring the progress of new generations of some of the world's most valuable babies, 'Baby Planet' is a heart-warming series that tells the uplifting stories and new developments of the animal world.",
