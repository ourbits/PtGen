One moment can be total bliss, and with the wrong choice you can find yourself falling apart. Each choice and action leads down a different road. Lisa Howe thought she had it all. A perfect life with the man of her dreams. Until she came to the cross roads, and found herself in the arms of another man. Karma Baby is a short film taking a dramatic and vivid look into the life of a woman and how temptation, rumors, lies and deceit have her caught up in a whirlwind of regret and consequence.—Baran, Steve",
