    "introduction": "Louisa Alcott was her own best character, and her life was dramatic, funny, surprising, and mysterious enough for several novels. Louisa May Alcott: The Real Woman Who Wrote Little Women will trace her struggle from poverty to wealth and celebrity, the lifelong conflict between her powerful desires and her family's powerful needs, and her dedication to mastering the art and craft of writing.The first film biography of this protean personality will tell its story through dramatizations, interviews with scholars and devotees, and clips from film and television adaptations. The film will draw upon a rich trove of archival materials, make use of the new imagery of digital animation, and take advantage of authentic historic locations.",
