    "introduction": "Two thieves, Dimon and Petya easily steal a black BMW 750 (BMW E38), and drive it to a chop shop. When they arrive, they decide to keep the BMW and have their mechanic forge new plates and serial numbers for the engine. While driving from the chop shop, a cop pulls them over and takes them to the station, where they pay a $1,000 bribe and are released. Kostya goes home to his devoted wife Nastya, who is sick of Kostya’s criminal lifestyle, and wants to leave Russia (in favour of France) for good.Just when the couple are about to argue about emigrating again, Kostya’s cell phone rings (this movie ringtone later became a pop hit song) with a frantic call from his brother Dimon. Dimon had been driving all over the road in his white Mercedes when he nearly collided with a group of \"skyless\" gangsters. These heavies forced him to pull over, beat him up, and stole his car. Dimon needs Kostya and the other \"brothers\" help to get his car back. Lyokha and Petya track down the gang that stole their friend's car, and they barge into the gangsters' offices. When the gangsters start trading insults and threats, Lyokha pulls a pistol and shoots a man dead. The men then have to go on the run from both the mob and the police, meanwhile encountering the harsh reality of post-Soviet Russia's countryside.",
