    "introduction": "Karma is a subtle and all-encompassing principle, which governs Man's experiential universe just like gravity's governance over the physical plane. It is Karma that's always there, in its fullest potency to convey people, even when people did not comprehend. \"I symbolize the invisible gravity as Karma by having a man perform a difficult task to win over gravity (destiny). The film takes place near a cement factory where we see mountains that are deformed by a series of blasts. Together with a man struggling to transport heavy recycle garbage. It is a visual metaphor reflecting the idea of reincarnation.\" (Jakrawal Nilthamrong)",
