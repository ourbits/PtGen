Though clearly besotted with Joan, Tony was struggling with drink and violent depression.After months of turmoil, Joan gave him a final ultimatum: if he made a go of Australia, if he kept off the booze for a year, she would leave John and marry him.Tony left for Australia determined to win Joan over. But tragically he never returned.Based on Joan Le Mesurier's autobiography Lady Don't Fall Backwards and Edward Joffe's Hancock's Last Stand, this moving film tells the story of Hancock and Joan's love affair and its tragic end.Ben Stephenson, BBC Head of Drama Commissioning, says: \"Hancock remains a much-loved national treasure and this is an extraordinary insight into the mind of a comic genius.\"",
