    "introduction": "The revolution had triumphed: in January 1979, the Shah had to leave Iran. Then the ayatollah took power. In Polish August 1980, the Solidarność union formed and changed the country with their strikes. The ascent followed the decline. Andreas Hoessli was a research fellow in Poland at that time. He met the reporter legend Ryszard Kapuściński. Because of his contacts he was also under surveillance by the Polish secret service. Forty years later, he returns to Poland and in turn questions the agents of the secret service. He travels to Iran and interviews contemporary witnesses of the revolution and later generations.",
