    "introduction": "Here is a bitingly sardonic satire of the mainstream media/cinema directed by Austrian queer actor/auteur Peter Kern (Street Kid aka Gossenkind, Initiation aka Blutsfreundschaft). \"Mörderschwestern\" aka \"Murder Sisters\" is a work of meta-cinema starring Helmut Berger and Susanne Wuest that incessantly knocks down the fourth wall to the point where the viewer becomes an actual character in the film and is constantly heckled by the deranged female antihero (who describes the viewer as a \"possum\"). The film is also partly set in the backdrop of the Lainz Angels of Death murders (link) when four Viennese nurses (Maria Gruber, Irene Leidolf, Stephanija Mayer, and Waltraud Wagner) murdered countless patients between 1983 and 1989 at Lainz General Hospital in Vienna. By 2008, all four of the naughty nurses were released from prison, with one of which acting as a fictional narrator/presenter/heckler in \"Mörderschwestern.\" The film also features some 'hagsploitation' and anti-Heimat elements.",
