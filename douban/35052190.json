When they are tricked by an entrepreneurial shady woman to help her renovate an old Japanese house for free room and board, they unwittingly break a binding spell and unleash a box of angry ancient Japanese cotton creatures, that slowly start to hunt them down. Connected to the creatures is the ghost of a young Japanese girl, whom only Tyler can see, and while he falls in love with her, Ryan thinks she is one of the killer sheets.",
