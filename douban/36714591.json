    "introduction": "Four separate stories are mixed in this ensemble film. The main characters have a better life within reach, but they all have some kind of fear that stops them from going for their happiness. A boy (12) gets kissed by a girl. Apparently this means his carefree days of playing are over. A girl (28) secretly observes a boy she rejected and slowly realizes what she's missing. A woman (45) focuses on her job, but loses touch with her family. A grumpy old woman (80) sits in the park everyday. A playful old man sees through her harsh attitude and finds a way to get closer to her. The film has a playful but melancholic view on how people wrestle with their hopes and fears in daily life.",
