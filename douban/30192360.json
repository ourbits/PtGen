    "introduction": "Not everything is at it seems, when 8-year old Lucy's imagination proves to be a reality. Based on the work by Neil Gaiman and Dave McKean, Wolves in the Walls transports you into the magic of virtual reality cinema, where only you can help Lucy discover what's truly hiding inside the walls of her house. Conceptualized by the Emmy-Award winning team that brought you Henry, and choreographed by New York's critically acclaimed immersive theater company, Third Rail, this immersive-fable asks; what would it be like to interact, have a relationship, and go on a quest with a character inside a virtual reality movie?",
