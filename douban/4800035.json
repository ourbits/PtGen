    "introduction": "This teaming of Lilian Harvey and Hans Albers was without the sensational chemistry UFA was used to in the Harvey/Fritsch films. There were supposedly competitive issues that put Harvey on her guard and challenged Albers' ego. Still, the tension between the two works to the advantage of this stage farce filled with mistaken identities and lover's quarrels.Lilian plays Eva, a young girl taking some time in a health spa and spending her evenings in the town's vaudeville theatre enamoured by a heavily made-up clown called Quick. Quick takes a shine to her and tries to woo her without make-up and masquerading as the theatre's manager. Unable to resolve her feelings for Quick and the theatre manager, Eva is angered when she finally learns that they are one and the same. But not for long, of course...Although this film is stage-bound and not a particularly good showcase for any of the main talents except Hans Albers, the mistaken identity and following runaround aren't as tiresome as in some films of that genre. There is some witty dialogue, but the stars are relying mostly on their screen personas to supply the charm. They do so quite effectively from the leads to the supporting cast. The whole thing makes for a lively and somewhat stylish farce.",
