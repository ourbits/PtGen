    "introduction": "THE LAST SACRIFICE uncovers the real-life witchcraft killing that inspired THE WICKER MAN and birthed the folk horror genre. This unsettling true-crime interrogation unlocks the perverse cultural undercurrents that shaped the genre from its murderous beginnings to its modern-day resurrection. This is a journey that gets under the skin of British polite society, that slays with pride, kills with prejudice and exposes an island nation's dark heart to reveal THE WICKER MAN is more fact than fiction.",
