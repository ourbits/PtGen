    "introduction": "In 2009, the civil war in Sri Lanka is raging. Ten thousand kilometres away in “Little Jaffna,” the Parisian quarter of La Chapelle that is home to the Tamil community in Paris, Seelan’s everyday existence is shaken. His flatmate, hearing no news of his family as the war is raging on, wants to return to their country of birth to try to find them. Seelan attempts to dissuade him. With parents being political refugees, director-actor Lawrence VALIN’s directorial debut gives a personal and poignant look of the Tamil diaspora in France. The sense of helplessness and anxiety are amplified when they witness the atrocity of war, knowing that their families suffer in Sri Lanka.",
