    "introduction": "全球的象牙交易導致非洲大象濒临绝种。当环境保育人士呼吁政府重視這持續發生的屠杀，有个勇敢的家庭幾十年來一直地努力扭轉情勢，一次一支大象。Gardeners of Eden是个扣人心弦，第一人称叙述的电影，记述肯亚的David Sheldrick野生動物基金會。從危機的最前線，我們見證了他們英勇和努力地阻止偷獵者，拯救被殺大象的孩子 - 孤兒小象，撫養他們，直到有一天，幫助他們重返大自然。Africa's elephants are hurtling towards extinction to fuel the worldwide ivory trade. While conservationists howl and corrupt governments fail to address the ongoing slaughter, one brave family has been working for decades to stem the tide, one elephant at a time. Gardeners of Eden is a gripping, first-person experience inside the operations of Kenya's David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. From the front lines of the crisis, we witness their heroic efforts to stop the poachers in the bush, rescue the orphans of slain elephants and raise them by hand, until one day, returning them to their home in the wild.
