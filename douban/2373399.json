An American dancer in Vegas looks for his big break; a Korean son seeks his fathers approval; a twelve-year-old boy in France confronts his familys racism  all the b-boys lives collide in Germany where their skills are put to the ultimate test: the Battle of the Year finals, with crews from 18 nations vying for the title of World Champion.",
