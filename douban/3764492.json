    "introduction": "There are few things better in summer than a good blockbuster beach read. You know the sort of thing: you zip through it in an hour, it's frothy, fun and you don't really have to think about it at all.Monday, Monday (ITV, 9pm) is a bit like that: it's chick lit TV. Sorry, gentlemen: you're going to loathe it, possibly as much as Mistresses.There's the PA, who secretly does all of her boss's work for no recognition; her fiance's called off her wedding, she's moved to a new city and she pulls a bloke on a night out who - gasp! – turns out to be working in her new office. And he's dating her boss.Hang on, that all sounds familiar.... it's the plot from Working Girl, isn't it? Maybe Harrison Ford will drop by in future episodes, just to gee it along.To their credit, ITV do make some changes so it's not quite such shameless plot-pilfering.",
