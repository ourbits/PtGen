    "introduction": "A majestically dark story about an aristocratic family struggling to survive in a post-apocalyptic world. Amongst the bleak landscape of desolation, two young children, Otto and his sister Vera, hunt daily for food. Meanwhile at home in an abandoned ship, their delusional Mother pitifully clings onto the faded glory of their former aristocratic lives, indolently aided by her shiftless Maid. Full of opulent memories and dark ghosts, their life is a sad shadow of the past as each character copes with the grind of daily survival in their separate ways. When the sublimely malevolent Mister Griswald, the only man to survive the apocalypse, unexpectedly drops in for dinner, he sets in motion the final act - revealing the shocking secret of their survival. Written by Scott Lawrence",
