    "introduction": "Sixteen-year-old Najib luxuriates in his summer days of gaming until his mother informs him of a neighbour’s passing. Taking the keys to their apartment, he quickly discovers an unexpected world of painful questions. “Oceania is an ode to tenderness. To a new generation that carries on our struggles, that seeks to remember whilst also moving forward. A tribute to love, to the dead and martyrs, and to present history being dismantled and destroyed.” ~ Valentin Noujaïm",
