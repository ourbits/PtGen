    "introduction": "British 1950s and 60s glamour goddess Pamela Green disrobes for the disreputable camera of lover and business partner George Harrison Marks in this key example of their cine-collaborations for the 8mm home movie market. Stripping off on a set decked out like a swanky modern apartment, replete with exotic animal skins, Green offers voyeurs a drink and a cigarette, before reclining on her couch.Pamela Green played a crucial role in the establishment of Harrison Marks' 'glamour' empire. A gifted entrepreneur, she was instrumental in the 1957 launch of Marks' massively popular 'nude studies' photo magazine Kamera, and sometimes appeared inside. Green also had a brief but hugely important part in director Michael Powell's career-wrecking 1960 Soho-set thriller, Peeping Tom.",
