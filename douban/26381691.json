    "introduction": "Big Brother 3 was the third series of Big Brother UK. The series started on 24 May 2002, and ended on 26 July 2002. The final of this series drew 10.0 million viewers. Votes in the final week totalled 8.6 million.The series premiered on 24 May 2001, on Channel 4. The contestants were recorded 24 hours a day with cameras fixed around the House, and had to wear portable microphones. Big Brother 3 was the first of the main series to feature a live launch. Previously, Celebrity Big Brother 1 had featured a live launch. The launch night saw Davina McCall give a house tour, as well as discuss rumours that had been going on about the series. She then introduced the new housemates, and they entered the house live. Channel 4 broadcasted a daily highlights show, and from the first week there was a live eviction show hosted by Davina McCall, where the evicted housemate was interviewed. In the nightly highlight episodes, viewers are shown various highlights of a specific day in the house. Big Brother 3 saw the return of the psychiatrists providing commentary on events in the game, with the episodes featuring them being the highlights show after the most recent eviction. The live eviction episode was held on Friday, with a pre-eviction episode and an official eviction episode being held with a 60 minute gap between them. The season ended on July 26, 2001, lasting for a total of 64 days. Big Brother 3 saw numerous spin-off series' occur while it was on air. The Saturday Night Live spin-off began this series, and saw housemates competing in live tasks. It would last until midway through Big Brother 5, when it was axed due to poor ratings. Though not introduced this series, the Big Brother's Little Brother spin-off continued throughout this series, giving the show it's second series. Following this series, the special What the Housemates Did Next aired, and would later air after every season until Big Brother 9.",
