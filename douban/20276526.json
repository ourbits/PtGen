Freshmen Chris Webber, Jalen Rose, Juwan Howard, Jimmy King, and Ray Jackson came to campus in the fall of 1991 and were widely considered one of the best recruiting classes the school had ever seen, and the anticipation led to them being dubbed \"The Fab Five.\" The filmmakers sit down for interviews with not only the players themselves (except Webber, who refused to participate), but also with many of their opponents, including members of Duke.",
