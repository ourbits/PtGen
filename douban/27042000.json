    "introduction": "Eric and Quentin, hosts in a children's show, are at the peak of their television careers. On a night that is a little too crazy, they drink too much and do a little rubbish. Unfortunately, someone films their \"exploits\" and broadcasts the video over the Internet. It's bad buzz, the dreaded phenomenon for a public figure. Their producer gives them 48 hours to restore their image, otherwise they will be fired. The more the duo tries to get by, the more they accumulate blunders, as during the funeral of Quentin's grandmother.",
