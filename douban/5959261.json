    "introduction": "In 1972, a group of idealistic young filmmakers joined together to form Cine Manifest, a San Francisco political film collective. Marxists and artists, they set out to make politically relevant feature films that would appeal to mass audiences. They were successful in many ways -- they supported each other and their families for six years, completed two acclaimed independent features, 'Over-Under, Sideways-Down,' and 'Northern Lights,' and launched several notable film careers. But there were personal costs at every turn. Now, over thirty years later, nobody can agree whether their little social experiment was a success or a disaster. Award-winning cinematographer Judy Irola, the only female member of the collective, reunites with her old friends to figure out exactly what went right and what went wrong.",
