    "introduction": "Situated in one of the most industrial areas in the country, north of Porto, “Third Shift” is a melancholic portrayal of a youth trapped in a kind of limbo. The protagonist leaves his work shift and suffers an epileptic seizure. His physical recovery is also a long portrayal of encounters with friends, family, and his girlfriend. A somber portrait, made of silences and inconsequential sentences. On national highways, the protagonist’s car always moves at high speed, trying to mask his own sadness.",
