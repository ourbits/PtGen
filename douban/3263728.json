    "introduction": "Perfect fit to help build reading skills.Tivo has many on \"save until delete\" because my preschooler loves them.As their website says it best, \"SUPER WHY takes an innovative approach to learning by promoting reading as a powerful, meaningful experience for children aged 3 to 6 years old. We created the original show based on our expert knowledge of preschoolers' level of development, the entertaining features of television and the importance of a strong literacy curriculum. The interactive format encourages kids to actively participate in each episode. As they watch SUPER WHY they are completely absorbed in the adventure of the story while engaging in challenging games and activities. This format enables children to practice the critical skills that they need to learn to read. The unique balance between using interactivity to practice key literacy skills and telling engaging stories that make literacy relevant to children's own lives is a powerful new way to teach reading.\"Very well done show. We are hooked. Super Readers to the rescue! PBS is back in our line up with this one.",
