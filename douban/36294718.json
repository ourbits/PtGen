    "introduction": "Renowned dog behaviorist Cesar Millan comes back not only to rehabilitate dogs, but to train pet parents as well. With empty shelters and dog adoptions at a record high, his return to television gives new pet parents the tools they need to teach their dogs good habits and shed the bad ones. In addition, he helps pet parents better understand the connection that dogs have with their humans, and how people's actions can influence just how well, or poorly, their dogs behave. From the yards of the pet owners to his newly updated Dog Psychology Center, Cesar demonstrates the skills needed to create happy homes with furry best friends while equipped with a can-do attitude.",
