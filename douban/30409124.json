    "introduction": "With humor and heart, Bunkheads tells the story of the unlikeliest people forging a new family. One year into the zombie apocalypse we jump into an underground bunker where four zany survivors are hiding from the hordes above. This random group includes a floundering actress, a buff computer nerd, a goofball elementary teacher, and an immature wannabe rapper. Stuck in cramped quarters, the Bunkheads are isolated and hangry. As frustrations start to boil over we explore the lives, dreams, and fantasies of these lovable goofballs who aren't sure if they are holding out for a miraculous rescue or just biding time until they become zombie lunchables. As they await their fate, we learn that the hardest part of the zombie apocalypse isn't surviving; it's putting up with each other.",
