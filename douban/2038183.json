    "introduction": "From Wikipedia:İki Genç Kız (The international working title is 2 Girls) is a Golden Orange awarded 2005 Turkish film by Kutluğ Ataman, starring Feride Çetin, Vildan Atasever and Hülya Avşar. The film is based on Perihan Mağden's novel İki Genç Kızın Romanı (translated into English as 2 Girls), and it follows the novel's plot closely although it diverges from it at some points.The film is about two girls, Behiye (Feride Çetin) and Handan (Vildan Atasever), two teenage girls with contrasting characteristics and backgrounds, forming a close relationship with sexual implications. As they become closer and closer the relationship becomes more fragile, and the impossibility of the survival of their relationship becomes more evident by time. Economic, social, psychological, and sexual problems come in the way.Replikas, an experimental band provided the music for the film, and the music was published in 2006 with Film Müzikleri album.AwardsThe movie won three prizes in 2005 (Best Actress for Vildan Atasever, Best Cinematography for Emre Erkmen, and Best Director for Kutluğ Ataman) at Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival which gives out the most prestigious film awards in Turkey. Kutluğ Ataman was also awarded the Best Director in Istanbul International Film Festival with this film.",
