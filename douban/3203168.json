    "introduction": "1.A mad scientist and his bevy of vampires terrorize a German village. A detective and a witch set out to stop them2.Released and Presented by Richard Gordon (who had absolutely nothing to do with the production of this film) in the U.S. as \"Cave of the Living Dead\". The police cannot solve the mystery of the seven murders which have alarmed the local villagers. They call in Inspector Doren (Adrian Hoven) of Interpol,and the only clue the Chief Constable can give his young and famous (it says here) is the fact that, each time a murder was committed, the electric lights in the whole neighborhood went out.The locals believe that the killings of the young girls are linked to the vague shadows in the caves under the local castle and to the mysterious Curse of the Green Eyes. They distrust the young-and-famous inspector and offer no assistance when still another murder takes place in the village inn---in the room next to that occupied by the young-and-famous inspector---and the body disappears.There are may suspects: the chattering innkeeper; the servant John (John Kitzmiller); the deaf-and-dumb Tom (Emmerich Schrenk); and the inscrutable doctor, Profesor Adelsberg (Wolfgang Preiss) who has been issuing strange death certificates.Doren moves to the castle where Professor Adelsberg is carrying out some scientific studies. There, he meets the Professor's pretty assistant, Karin (Karin Field.) She is marked as the next victim, and would have been if the young-and-famous Interpol Inspector hadn't managed to discover the secret of the caves of the living dead and unmask the culprit.",
