    "introduction": "Leena prepares a meal for two and leaves her cottage to pick up her husband Boris from the hospital. The nurse warns them of his condition, but they’ve already decided to spend the night together. In the cottage they have dinner and try their best to enjoy themselves. As the night fades to an early morning we see a camera stand in the bedroom pointing towards them.Director's StatementAlthough Blue Note is essentially my homage to my parents and their love and respect towards each other. It’s also a conversation opener on our view of death in modern society.",
