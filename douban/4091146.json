The basis of short films put the story of contemporary Soviet writer Grigory Baklanov, though, which removed his name from the title, as a writer, he said, were \"entirely different motives for writing this story.\" Director of prose in his film took only one motive that will attract his usual - the motif of the \"transition period\": in this case, the transition from the helm to prostrate submission.
