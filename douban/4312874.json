    "introduction": "An elegant comedy of manners, based on W. Somerset Maugham's \"Theatre\". For once, the English-dubbed version can be recommended. Expert impersonators do the voices of Lilli Palmer and Charles Boyer, and the dubbing of the rest of the cast is on a similarly extremely high level. This film was actually an Austrian-French co-production, with 2nd unit work by Jean Sorel in London. It was directed by a German, Alfred Weidenmann, with just about an evenly mixed French and German cast. The direction is smooth, the photography able, and the girls, costumed by Pierre Balmain, are most attractive. The music score is nothing short of delightful. And I particularly liked the dialogue device of giving Miss Pakmer acid little comments on the action. (imdb.com)Adorable Julia, by director Alfred Weidenmann, is perhaps a little too provincial or out-moded for most audiences in spite of the sophisticated allure of Lili Palmer and Charles Boyer in the lead roles. Palmer plays the title character Julia, the philandering wife of Michel (Boyer), a very understanding husband. At the moment, the aging Julia is involved in an affair with Tom (Jean Sorel), a younger man more interested in climbing up the social ladder via this liaison than in any real romantic commitment. For several different reasons, Julia finally begins to see the light and starts to reconsider her long and well-established relationship with her husband.",
