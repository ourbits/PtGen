    "introduction": "Temo is an unemployed actor who drives around 100km a day on a scooter, performing the duty of a delivery man. Based on the novel Courier’s Tales by Temo Rekhviashvili, who plays himself in the film, Anka Gujabidze crafts a poignant but humorous black and white photo adventure, in which a daily ride through the opulently dilapidated Georgian capital Tbilisi morphs into a nightmarish vision of poverty, corruption and estrangement.",
