    "introduction": "To walk into the jungle-shrouded village of Cinquera, El Salvador, is to enter a world where ghosts walk, passing back and forth between the past and present. During the 1980–92 civil war, Cinquera was invaded by the National Guard, which targeted it as a potential haven for guerrillas of the FMLN opposition. Cinquera was literally wiped off the map, disappearing temporarily from official charts in a conflict that resulted in 80,000 deaths with tens of thousands more disappeared. Here, decades after a brutal civil war annihilated the village, survivors return to bury their dead and rebuild the community from the ashes. Award for the best feature documentary film from the Documentary Film Festival Visions du Réel (2011).",
