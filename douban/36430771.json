    "introduction": "A short documentary which portrays an everyday struggle of the two immigrants from Chechenya, Vakha and his son Magomed. The audience is given an opportunity to observe an everyday routine of the couple where, between the mundane chores, proofs of the true affection and care are exposed. Apart from depicting harsh reality of the newly arrived immigrants and their life in Warsaw (Poland), what is the most important one can see how the bond between the father and the son deepens and how, despite of the circumstances, they attempt to retain their identity. The life story of Vakha and Magomed is never fully told, it simply runs in the background and that's what helps to place some universal values up front.源自：https://www.krakowfilmfestival.pl/en/online-cinema/film/4142/",
