Val has received a note,telling her she has been short-listed for promotion,as a result of which she demonstrates,helped by a cardboard box,her means of giving herself confidence. Roger,about to face the tribunal with regard to his sacking,also receives a note,whose contents he finds very worrying. Written by don @ minifie-1",
