    "introduction": "Jeune Cinéma is a footage film documentary about the famous yet forgotten HyèresFilm Festival which took place from 1965 to 1983. It was at that time the most importantin France just after the glamorous Cannes Film Festival and a friendly place to discoveryoung directors such as Gilles Garrel, Akerman, Helma Sanders, Schroeter or Caraxbefore they became a legend for the art-house film amateurs. Hyères was a vividspace for passionate debates, incredible polemics and above all surprising encounters.In a word, it was THE place to be for all the cinephiles. If it suddenly disappearedin 1983, it is not only because of internal and political conflicts but also for an unfaircompetition with Cannes. The « Perspectives » section at Cannes, widely inspiredby Hyères, was attracting those same young talents discovered there. My personalhistory as a filmmaker is deeply tied to the “Collectif Jeune Cinéma”, which wasin charge of the “Cinéma Différent” section. Therefore, it’s with a real emotion thatI have dived into the festival’s unreleased archives - finding astounding debatesor hilarious reactions of the audience - in order to reweave the thread of that forgottenand yet so meaningful story about Cinema.",
