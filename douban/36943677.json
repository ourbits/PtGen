    "introduction": "A woman hovers in a floating pool and ruminates about the political situation in Brazil. Far from home, she tells us succinctly and from personal experience about the injustices and the menace of a fascist government in her country. Steeped in dark blue, this essay mixes archival footage with personal memories and thoughts, making a person’s inner conflict tangible and visible.",
