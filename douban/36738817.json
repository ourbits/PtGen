    "introduction": "Diane Warren has written record numbers of mega-hits for the biggest artists in the business. She’s been nominated for 14 Academy Awards, has won Grammy, Emmy, and Golden Globe Awards, and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. With levity and her trademark middle finger, the film is an intimate, funny, and revealing underdog story that focuses on Diane’s idiosyncratic songwriting process, rebellious life choices, extraordinary work ethic, stories surrounding her greatest collaborations, and how she's turned her neurodiversity from a setback into her superpower.",
