    "introduction": "Gain visits her hometown to see her critically ill father only to find an awkward tension between them. She gets to know a man named Dokyung who came from Seoul and becomes close to him. As Gain sees who he really is, though, she feels her life is being threatened.The films directed by Zin-soo No have usually shown a style of compressing complex mental states into simple situations. This is because the Director shows his preference for B movies and enjoys depicting the characters stuck in a situation, instead of the dramas of complex psychology. However, this film has more depictions on one's psychology, hence naturally focuses more on characters' behaviors and breaths. Dokyung and Gain, who meet each other as if they were meant to be, are victims of the past, and have grown into attackers without knowing it. The two sadist and masochist indulge in carnal pleasures, running to an extreme end. Putting strong sexual descriptions and bodies covered in blood in front, The Suffered conducts its genre-specific investigation on human. The cinema of Zin-soo No now begins in earnest.
