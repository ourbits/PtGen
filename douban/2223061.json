    "introduction": "Synopsis:Stray Cats depicts how two hopelessly romantic best friends negotiate for fair and equal treatment from their lovers, and how they both eventually liberate themselves from their common and sometimes comical romantic traps.Boyet (Ricky Davao) is a gay man living next door to his best friend and confidant Martha (Irma Adlawan), a straight woman dealing with a long-term relationship that is seemingly going nowhere. While Boyet deals with his elusive and sometimes \"straight\" boyfriend Dom (Lauren Novero), Martha is frustrated with her long-term romance with the handsome and elusive Steve (Reggie Curley). Add Boyet's live-in \"son\" JoJo (Alchris Galura) to the scenario, and the antics are non-stop!Stray Cats is an imaginative parody concerning adult romance and day-to-day relationships, set in modern day Philippines.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0476359/STRAY CATS (PUSANG GALA) is a an odd but in the end endearing mixture of cinematic styles, soap opera drama, tender little comedy, and hefty measures of relationship philosophy: perhaps this is the Filipino brand of magical realism. Based on a play by Jun Lana and adapted for the screen by Rody Vera and writer/director Ellen Ongkeko-Marfil, the movie boasts a fine little cast and it is the cast's commitment to the project that sets the film sailing.",
