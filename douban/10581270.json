    "introduction": "brRRMMMWHEee II is fast and furious electronic pop at its best. The speedy flow of sounds and images is based on its own little media archeology: high-pitched noise from a cathode tube of the type used in old television sets, the crackling of a record album, patterns of colors like those generated by an analogue video mixer, and lastly the whirr of a computer’s processing unit. And hidden in the middle of all this, a deformed tuna can serves as a surreptitious and barely discernible memento of the fact that the world once comprised something other than electronic circuits. All these signals and media feed the wild parcourse of brRRMMMWHEee II, in which fragments of sounds and images are captured with analogue methods only. They are joined by micro-sounds generated by the individual machines, which are linked to the recurrent images and function in a way similar to musical riffs: alternating, interrupting and drowning each other out, in the end overlapping and pursuing each other.",
