    "introduction": "Jacob, a 13 year-old boy, is being raised as the 'perfect son' for his blind parents. Along with numerous duties, he is their 'eyes' to the outside world in the small town of early 2000's Latvia. The last thing he wants is to let them down, but everything changes when Jacob falls in love with Liene, a girl from his school. By pretending he is just like any other kid, Jacob leads a double life, covering up his strive for independence. While his parents are about to lose their jobs at the soon-to-be closed factory, Jacob becomes alienated from his mother who has lost sight of his split personality. A successful participation in the local 'Special Olympics' will alleviate the financial burden, but for Jacob it becomes the perfect storm, forcing to face his fears of disappointment and answering a question - 'who is blind?'.",
