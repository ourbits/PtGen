    "introduction": "In the new show full of excitement, eight couples compete against each other. The contestants are given new challenges every week: they have the opportunity to show their imaginative designs and technical skills, which are judged by the professional LEGO builder Dóczy Balázs Dóczy, the Master Builder of the LEGO® Masters and the professional jury of the contestants' creations. The players not only struggle with spectacular - and at the same time complicated - challenges, time, but also with each other. At the end of the episodes, one team will say goodbye to the show, and in the finale it will be revealed: which pair will win the LEGO Masters title and the HUF 10 million grand prize for the winner.",
