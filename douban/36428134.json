Little by little, what begins as a pleasant walk through some peaceful gardens becomes a metaphor for her own reality. Ana and Son get lost in a labyrinth in which they will relive the confusion, unconsciousness and tension of their own relationship. Once they understand that they are lost, Ana and Son will be able to look into each other’s eyes and begin to find each other.",
