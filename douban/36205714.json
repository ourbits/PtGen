    "introduction": "\"Sunday at Il Posto Accanto\" is a love letter to a neighborhood restaurant but maybe more than that it is a love letter to the neighborhood restaurant. In this film, the neighborhood restaurant is where the community tribe gathers. It is August 8th, 2021 on New York City's Lower East Side and the tribe is just stepping back out into the world. Starring solo performer wizard, Danny Hoch, and the lower east side's own Victor Rasuk (How to make it in America, Raising Victor Vargas) \"Sunday at Il Posto Accanto\" is a comedy about community, friendship and love where a neighborhood haunt draws its people together to heal, dance, laugh and taste life.",
