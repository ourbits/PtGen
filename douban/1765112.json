    "introduction": "In search of extra points, student Tadokoro (Nagaoka) joins the university’s erotic writing club, finding a somewhat lifeless gathering of five men around a table. Led by the 56-year-old Sakamoto (veteran Emoto of The Eel and Dr. Akagi fame), who is still enrolled because “being married gives you a discount on tuition,” they congregate in a cramped room whose four walls are covered floor to ceiling with nudie posters. The club’s sole female member, the spunky Mayama (Eguchi), is also its most talented, already contributing stories to a weekly men’s magazine and getting paid for them. Mayama immediately spots the virgin and takes the newcomer back to her place for a deflowering. No sooner has he popped or she is in front of her computer to incorporate the experience in her story, the serialised adventures of 14-year-old virginal boy and the older woman who educates him in the ways of the woman. Tadokoro quickly becomes her case study and model for the ongoing plot, but realises he wants more from this sprightly girl than bouts of skilful sex.",
