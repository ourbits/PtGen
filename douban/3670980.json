    "introduction": "Two young high school boys, Manga and Sory, are gay and in love in Guinea. This is their story.The first feature film on homosexuality from sub-Saharan Africa. While \"coming out\" may have become primetime fare in the U.S., this film was met with angry protests when it was shot in the director's native Guinea and has generated heated debate among Africanists here as well. But beyond its controversial topic, Dakan is a contemporary African reinterpretation of the age-old Romeo and Juliet conflict between love and social convention.DAKAN is the story of two men who by \"coming out\" disappear, become invisible to their families and society, because their society has no language which recognizes their love.",
