    "introduction": "This is one of the best musicals Azerbaijan has ever produced. It's full of wonderful music by a great Azerbajanian composer Uzeyir Hajibeyov. \"Arshin Mal Alan\" took the Soviet Union by storm when it was released in 1945. To this day, the movie holds a special place in the hearts of millions. One only needs to ask any descendants of soviet union about this movie and their faces will surely be lid up with smiles. Iosif Stalin, who was the head of the Soviet Union at the time of the musical's release was so captivated by the picture that he gave all of the actors a special honorary recognition. This timeless musical has produced many copycats that don't even come close to the original classic. This Azerbaijanian produced musical is the only one that justifies the magnificent music of Uzeyir Hajibeyov(the crown jewel of Azerbaijanian Music). Witty plot, beautiful music, wonderful singing and great acting by Azerbaijanian actors make this musical a timeless classic.",
