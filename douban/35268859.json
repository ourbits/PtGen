    "introduction": "GRAY IS THE NEW BLONDE is an inspiring documentary whose time has come. En masse, women all across the world of all ages, ethnicities, and socio-economic backgrounds are choosing, on purpose to ditch the dye and embrace their gorgeous grays. They are no longer willing to succumb to the outdated notion that they must cover their grays in order to be an attractive, desirable and respected member of society. This long-held view has begun to change and this film, produced and directed by Victoria Marie will serve as a historical account of this cultural shift. It will explore how the world has negatively viewed women with gray hair for decades and more importantly how this has begun to change. Simply put, our mission is to show the world how beautiful natural, gray hair can be on a woman and to provide encouragement for all those seeking it. And in the process move towards acceptance and eventual reverence as enjoyed my our male counterparts. IT'S EVOLUTION. IT'S REVOLUTION. IT'S GREYVOLUTION.",
