It's a place where elephants roam in massive herds, lions stalk kudu, leopards prowl for wildebeest, and crocodiles lurk in muddy rivers. For animal lovers, this is a once-in-a-lifetime safari destination. But for Brent and Grant Reed, this is home. These two animal-obsessed brothers live, work, and play in the wild. Join Brent and Grant as they manage their exciting safari and guide training business, and work towards their personal desire to save and protect the animals that share their home in the Okavango.",
