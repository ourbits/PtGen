As a child Bimal had a favourite corner classroom where he used to sit and daydream out of a broken window, and so when he finds himself back in his old school he feels compelled to replace the window. Bimal ends up using his fiancee Meera's savings - money she put aside for the child they're expecting - without telling her. Unexpectedly when he presents the window to the authorities it is rejected and matters only get worse when Meera discovers what Bimal has done as she leaves him.",
