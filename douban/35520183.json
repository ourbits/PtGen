    "introduction": "What if even after selling over 20 million albums, you still felt depressed? Moby Doc portrays a surreal journey narrated by Moby himself (and featuring interviews with David Lynch and David Bowie), in which the artist reflects on his own idyosincratic and turbulent personal life. From his traumatic childhood and experiences in underground punk to his stratospheric success as a solo artist, from his addiction to drugs and alcohol to his vegan activism, Moby Doc reveals the man behind the music.",
