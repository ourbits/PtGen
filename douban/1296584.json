    "introduction": "What constitutes a sufficient motivation for crimes? Can any motivation possibly excuse the man this movie compares to Satan? Certainly he knows about the stash of money a woman government official has illegally hidden away. He also knows that she occasionally has affairs, and despite that she has rejected his sexual advances, even though he is coldly charming and quite handsome. Whatever the reason, as the film opens, he has lured the woman's ten-year old daughter to a secluded spot and swiftly murdered her. This man is a sexual predator of a very curious type: he seduces women through his uncanny persistence as often as he rapes them. Meanwhile, he has contacted the official whose daughter he killed, claiming that he has kidnapped her and demanding ransom. This chilling portrait of an amoral monster in the midst of an immoral society won a Silver Bear at the 1991 Berlin Film Festival.",
