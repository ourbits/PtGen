There's only one problem - All they have are five worn-out go-karts to work with. How can they beat reigning champion Vicky Roman in those old wrecks? It's time for some good old teamwork. Can the Friends design, upgrade and customize their go-karts in time to win the race? One thing is for sure - nothing can stop them from trying. And hey, it doesn't hurt to have a cool team hit song to boost their motivation, right?",
