    "introduction": "Choying Drolma, a child of a forced marriage and a victim of domestic violence, seeks refuge in a Tibetan Buddhist monastery where she learns to sing. An American musician brings her music to the United States of America, from where she starts her global music journey. However, some believe nuns should not sing, and her concert is boycotted in Hong Kong. Despite such criticism, Choying Drolma becomes a rock-star nun, fighting for girl education with her heavenly voice. She founds a modern school for girls, builds a hospital in Kathmandu, addresses gender equality in the United Nations, calls for educational reform in Abu Dhabi, and receives the Freedom Award in Warsaw. However, a dark cloud remains in her heart since she cannot free herself emotionally from the past. She decides to fulfil her late father’s last wish and retrace her roots in Tibet.",
