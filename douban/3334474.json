    "introduction": "A turn for the better as far as quality is concerned was also taken by the mystery and adventure film genres. There were detective stories by Petr Schulhoff (b. 1922) - for example, \"The Murderer Hides His Face\" (\"Vrah skryva tvar\" - 1966) - and a mystery with political motivations filmed by Stepan Skalsky (1925) - \"The Pathway Through the Deep Forest\" (\"Cesta hlubokym lesem - 1964), which revealed the background of one of the most infamous secret police 'frame-ups' of the early fifties - as well as the exceptional \"Sign of Cancer\" (\"Ve znameni raka\" - 1966), directed by Slovak director Juraj Herz, who was working in Prague. In 1968, Herz made an interesting political horror film, \"The Cremator\" (\"Spalovac mrtvol\"), the story of a 'small' man who is transformed by ideology into a mass murderer.This is a criminal drama whose main negative character is an unknown serial killer. The body of a young woman is found in the village of Drnovice and inspector Kalas will have to do everything he can in order to catch the murderer.Petr Schulhoff's first film was the detective story Fear (1963). A series of remarkable crime dramas continued with the films The Murderer Hides his Face (1966) and In the Footsteps of Blood (1969), in which Rudolf Hrusinsky shone in the role of investigator. In his next crime thriller I Know You're a Murderer (1971) the later famous director Jiri Adamec appeared. In the seventies he found new bearings in the the comedy of manners. The first was called Are We a Good Match, Darling...? (1974). Another satire, Tomorrow We'll Make It, Sweetheart..! (1976) tells of two families whose mutual envy makes them try to outdo one another in nastiness.",
