    "introduction": "The story, written by Zsófi Lányi, revolves around thirtysomething identical twins Éva and Adél. They are very distant and different from one another, but they lead equally hypocritical lifestyles and need to face up to reality when they fall in love with the same guy, who is everything they are not: radically open, direct and naive. They end up in a bizarre, unfulfilled love affair, which contributes to making both of their lives a little less miserable.",
