    "introduction": "A number of B.B.C. sketch shows appeared in the wake of 'Not The Nine O'Clock News', all attempting to recapture the original's healthy disrespect for authority and revelling in sheer bad taste for the sake of it. Made by B.B.C. Scotland, and executive produced by Sean Hardie, 'A Kick Up The Eighties' is today best remembered for bringing the then-unknown Rik Mayall ( credited as Kevin Turvey ) to a mass audience. Turvey, a Brummie idiot who fancied himself as an investigative reporter, delivered surreal monologues to camera which he concluded by saying: \"Kevin's 'ere!\", whilst touching his left ear. Turvey became a cult character, leading to him getting his own one-off show: 'Kevin Turvey - The Man Behind The Green Door'.",
