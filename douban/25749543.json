Back in Brazil he is faced with the jealousy of his bastard brother who, after plotting his death, took his place in the family business. He needs to overcome the obstacles that separate him from the woman he loves, worker Amélia. It's up to Pearl, the fruit of their union, to smooth over the conflicts that prevent their love. Furthermore, Franz and Amelia will receive some news about his forced stay in the Himalayas--and a surprise.",
