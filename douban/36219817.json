    "introduction": "“Getting old is inevitable; becoming mature is optional” is the motto adhered to by Alber (played by Julián López), a rapper who enrols in university at the not-so-tender age of 44 in order to win a bet with his father. If he doesn’t pass all of his subjects, he will have to kiss goodbye to “this rap nonsense” forever. Once in the classroom, he reunites with Amaia (Miren Ibarguren), a radio DJ and teacher there, and discovers that something important has been missing from his life: love.",
