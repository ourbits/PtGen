    "introduction": "The Three Dees, a down-at-heel circus act, are stranded in a moor-land layby waiting for a phone call which will summon them to an exotic tour of Europe. For Don DeMarco(Martin Shaw) the isolation is a perfect cover for a dangerous secret in his past. For his sexually dissatisfied wife, a drunk with a sense of humour, it is purgatory. When Denise wickedly exposes herself to a passing police officer, the act attracts the whole of the local police force. This unleashes a bizarre chain of events encompassing intrigue, black humour .....and murder..... This film is a delightful combination of humour and suspense, carefully balanced, executed to a beautiful soundtrack from Stanley Myers.",
