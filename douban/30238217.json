    "introduction": "Modern Dinosaurs explores New Zealand’s wildlife and extraordinary fossil record. Over six episodes we’ll learn why creatures here are so unique. Each episode is led by scientists and adventurers who take us to remote, spectacular locations: New Zealand’s tuatara is a living fossil.How did it survive when dinosaurs became extinct? The Kiwi; how did a flightless bird find itself on islands in the middle of the ocean? New Zealand’s dramatic landscape has been violently forged, creating environments in which unique species evolved. We’ll also be exploring the incredibly different landscapes and wildlife of Australia, New Zealand’s nearest neighbor and to which it was once attached. Modern Dinosaurs considers evolution over millennia: how New Zealand was created and how it is changing. What will the future bring for today’s animals?The Tuatara (Episode 1)The Kiwi (Episode 2)Modern Dinosaurs, Extreme Survivors (Episode 3)A very strange Parrot (Episode 4)Island Giants (Episode 5)Violent Seas (Episode 6)",
