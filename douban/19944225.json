    "introduction": "In World War II more than 110,000 Japanese Americans were forced to leave their homes and relocate to military camps dotted across the western United States. TIME OF FEAR tell the story of the 16,000 men, women, and children who were sent to two relocation camps in southeast Arkansas - one of the poorest and most racially segregated places in America. It also explores the reactions of the native Arkansans who watched in bewilderment as their tiny towns were overwhelmed by the influx of outsiders. Using rare home moved of the camp and exclusive interviews, TIME OF FEAR tells a powerful tale of racism and resilience that still resonates today.",
