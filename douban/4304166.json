    "introduction": "Late World with Zach was a television show on VH1 during the spring of 2002, starring Zach Galifianakis.The 11 p.m. show began with a monologue, like many late night talk shows, but with Mr. Galifianakis's unique style. Interlaced with topical humour, Zach played a piano and included the non-sequiturs he usually uses in his act. After this, one or two skits starring Zach followed. One of the running skits was footage of red carpet interviews edited with Zach's obviously different questions. Last, Zach met with a guest (like Mathew St. Patrick) or had a musical guest play (like Rhett Miller).The show's most well-remembered sketch is \"Sneaky Jesus\".The series was cancelled after nine weeks of production due to poor ratings. The series is not currently slated for DVD release",
