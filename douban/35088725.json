    "introduction": "Anthropocene: Ivory BurnOn April 31, 2016, the largest ivory burn in history took place in Nairobi National Park. Eleven pyres comprised of 105 tonnes of confiscated elephant tusks and 1.35 tonnes of rhinoceros horn were set on fire as a clarion call to halt all trade in ivory. The street value of the pyres was estimated between 105 and 150 million dollars — representing between 6,000 and 7,000 elephants. The Anthropocene Project team was there to capture this deeply symbolic and visceral message to the poaching and illegal trade syndicates, and to bear witness to the loss of animal life and the diversity it embodied.This film bears witness to the burning of over 100 tons of elephant tusks and rhinoceros horn: a symbolic and visceral clarion call to the poaching and illegal trade syndicates. | 360 VR | Runtime: 6:26Directed by Nicholas de Pencier, Jennifer Baichwal, and Edward BurtynskyCurated by We Are One: A Global Film Festiva",
