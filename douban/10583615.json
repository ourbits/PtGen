    "introduction": "Popeye and Bluto are knights, jousting for the honor of Sleeping Beauty (Olive, with long blonde hair). Of course, Bluto plays dirty, squirting grease on the field in front of Popeye's horse, and using an extra-long lance. But Popeye wins anyhow, and climbs SB's tower with Bluto right behind him. They fight over her, playing tug-of-war with her pigtails.",
