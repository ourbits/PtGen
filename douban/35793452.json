He can't bring back the woman he loves, but he can cover the ground with the blood of his enemy. \"OCTOPUS POT\" syndrome - the Japanese call it Takotsubo syndrome - when stressful events cause the heart to balloon and distort, causing it to look like a traditional fishing trap. It scars and weakens the heart muscles and causes the left ventricle to distort and enlarge. The only outcome is certain death.",
