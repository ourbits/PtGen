    "introduction": "One day, the statues come to life. They descend from their podiums and architectural shrines, and head in the same direction. This sculptural apocalypse makes people anxious and worried: where are they going? A little girl with a mushroom-like body looks on in admiration. The steps that the marble and stone statues take spark joy: how unusual!You might describe this film as having a ghostly gothic sweetness. Barbara Rupik, who graduated from the Lodz Film School, has specialised in puppets and mixed media techniques. Her latest short film is a fable in the surrealist tradition and animist beliefs, which plays out in front of the people of the forest. A few years ago, the Polish director’s short film The Little Soul (2019) won the Cinéfondation prize at the Cannes Film Festival.源自：https://rigaiff.lv/en/films-2023/tadi-brinumi-notiek/",
