    "introduction": "Big Brother 4 in 2003 was the fourth series of Big Brother in the UK, a reality show shown on Channel 4 in which a number of contestants live in an isolated house trying to avoid being evicted by the public with the aim of winning a large cash prize at the end of the run. The series ran from Friday 23 May to Friday 25 July 2003.The reaction to this series was poor, the press and viewers finding the housemates boring. Big Brother turned \"evil\" and selected more extreme housemates the next year.",
