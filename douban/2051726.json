    "introduction": "Barenaked Ladies (BNL) have more than paid there dues as one of Canada's most popular bands. They finally broke through into the American listening audience with their infectious rat-ta-tat hit \"One Week.\" But to like the band for this song alone is doing them an injustice. \"Barenaked in America\" tells why. Directed by Jason Priestly, \"Barenaked in America\" is a delightful 100-minute look at some highlights from BNL's tour of America. Risding on the heels of success generated by the 1998 \"Stunt\" album, BNL finally reached the American audience and Priestly was there to capture it on film. The band has the unusual ability to combine deft lyrics with layers of deph and insight, along with three to four part harmonies (they have more than once attributed this to the Beach Boys and the Beatles). Though their humor is as subtle as perinnial college favorites They Might Be Giant, their good-natured personalities shine brightly. Never ones to take part in the miost recent trend, BNL relishes in just being themselves, and do an excellent job at keeping their private lives private (lead singer Ed Robertson has a child, while Stephen Page clocks in with two). Overall, \"Barenaked in America\" is a nice review of BNL's breakthrough into America. Only complaint: too short.",
