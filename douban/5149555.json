    "introduction": "A series of horrible murders prompts a massive police investigation. Inspector James Cameron (John Smihula), a two-fisted roughneck with his own philosophy on handling crime, heads the investigation. A group of lepers living in the Long Island wastelands have created a terror network, killing and feeding off the flesh of innocent victims. Their leader (Winston B. Anderson III) has mutated into an invulnerable monster; he intends to propagate and strengthen his stronghold. Aided by his son, Jack (Fred Borges), and a couple of motorcycle freaks, food is supplied to the clan via murder. As the authorities close in on the cannibal killers, an all-out bloodbath ensues.",
