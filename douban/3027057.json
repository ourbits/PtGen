    "introduction": "Taped from a live concert at the London Astoria 2 on February 14th, 1994, the center of attraction is the fabulous talent of Delores O'Riordan, as a singer, songwriter, and performer. In a simple flowing dress, and a red knit cap framing her angelic face, she has total command of the audience, whether prancing about on the stage or standing still and singing quietly.O'Riordan wrote songs # 2, 5, 6, 9, 11 and 13 alone, and the rest are credited to O'Riordan and Hogan.The Cranberries are:Delores O'Riordan, vocals and guitar / Fergal Lawler, drums / Noel Hogan, guitar / Mike Hogan, bass.This is terrific concert footage of a great and unique artist; she is beautiful to look at, and magical to hear. Total running time is 65 minutes.",
