    "introduction": "Three London motorcycle couriers Fred, Tyg and Grouch set off from London in search of an elusive hippy and his cannabis farm in the Welsh mountains. Originally intended as a 'nice weekend in the country' Fred has now found himself making a promise to his old friend The Chairman that whatever the circumstances and whatever situations arise he will not return empty handed. Grouch has also made a promise that come monday morning he'll be moving his belongings into his new found love Lucinda's flat and make a serious attempt at the world of relationships. As for Tyg no such pact's this is a man who's never been further than the outskirts of London and as far as he's concerned an industrial unit near Heathrow Airport is pretty much the back and beyond. No Tyg's out to explore to broaden his horizons to lose any ignorance and soak up the hospitality of another nation. But then what are those wild beast like noises from the woods and why are there two gangs of bikers in the area preparing to settle an old score. Is this reality or could it be the wild mushrooms they had for breakfast ! It's a three and a half hour journey from London to the Welsh mountains but for our three hero's it's just about to turn into the trip of a lifetime.",
