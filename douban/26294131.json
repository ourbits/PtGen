    "introduction": "Under somewhat murky circumstances, American independent filmmaker Jon Moritsugu was invited by PBS to make an hour-long film. The result was the nightmarish Terminal USA, a garishly lit version of the American Dream filmed on the ugliest sitcom set imaginable.\"... Moritsugu turns the American sitcom family on its head with \"Terminal USA,\" a post-punk, psychedelic picnic brimming with wholesome depravity and playfully twisted stereotypes.\"You'll find it here in its 70 minute \"director's cut\" version (more about that in the quoted interview segments below).",
