    "introduction": "-Montreal (in Canada), 1991. Eleven year old Delphis grew up in a poor neighborhood and an unstable family environment. One night he decides to take control of his life and becomes L'Ouragan (Hurricane). Armed with a lightning bolt on his bandanna and his middle finger held high, he leads his life as he sees fit, in a world that has no place for him. His adventure is like a road trip, from the slums to downtown, from one family to another. In the course of his time on the streets and in his attempts to conquer himself, he finds what's most important: his purity.",
