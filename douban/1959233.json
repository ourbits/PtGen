    "introduction": "Debussy's masterpiece, Pelléas et Mélisande, is based on Maurice Maeterlinck's symbolist play - a tragic fairytale, which recounts the ill-fated love of half-brothers Golaud and Pelléas for the same woman, the enigmatic Mélisande. Haunting and intensely atmospheric, Debussy's score continues where language ends, articulating the dream-like inner worlds of the doomed lovers. Melodic vocal lines and motifs resurface throughout the opera like snatched memories.A lyric drama in five acts with the Glyndebourne Festival Opera, conducted by Andrew Davis, with Christiane Oelze as Melisande and Richard Croft singing Pelleas. With the London Philharmonic Orchestra and the Glyndebourne Chorus.\"…I have rarely heard Debussy sound richer, or the dying fall of the last act fade more poignantly into infinite darkness.\" THE DAILY TELEGRAPH \"…the cast is on top form. John Tomlinson's Golaud is superb…Christiane Oelze is a mix of elusive glamour and vulnerability.\"",
