    "introduction": "In August 1914, war was declared between France and Germany. Maurice Genevoix, young man, is appointed to the 106th regiment of infantry. The young soldiers go to the front thinking that this war will be of short duration. But they will soon know the hell of the trenches and terribly murderous fights.When Maurice Genevoix was seriously wounded at the Eparges on 25 April 1915, he knew that his war was over, but he felt no relief. He experiences only the bitterness of leaving his men. Those with whom he spent 9 months, time to forge in the terrible crucible of war, an indissoluble fraternity ... Inspired by the 'Ceux de 14', a collection of stories of war gathered in 1949 by Maurice Genevoix.",
