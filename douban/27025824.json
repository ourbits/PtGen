    "introduction": "Bound is a fast-paced, sexually-charged, psychological thriller set amongst the popular cityscapes and landmarks of Dallas, TX. This character driven story follows a culturally-diverse cast of scarred individuals whose lives have become intertwined through a series of co-dependant relationships and sexual fetishes. As clues from the past unravel a tangled web of love, resentment, abuse and deceit, our cast of extremely damaged characters are on the run. Who will catch the killer or be able make a clean cut from the past? There is no telling. But one thing is for certain, there is a killer on the loose and the killing won't stop until the most animalistic needs are filled.",
