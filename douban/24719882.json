    "introduction": "Due to the popularity of Kids React, The Fine Brothers spawned a spin-off dubbed Teens React on November 17, 2011 with \"TEENS REACT TO TWILIGHT\".[28] The show has a similar premise to Kids React, however the younger stars are replaced with teens, some of whom have aged out of the Kids React series. Due to this, the Fine Brothers are able to show more mature and less \"kid-friendly\" videos such as videos on topics like Toddlers & Tiaras[14] and Rick Perry's Strong commercial.[29] Other viral videos and YouTube stars that have been reacted to include Salad Fingers, the Overly Attached Girlfriend, \"Gangnam Style\", The Hunger Games trailer,[30] Shane Dawson,[31] and One Direction,[32] among other topics. Teens React has also featured some \"famous\" 'reactors' such as Lisa Cimorelli, Amy Cimorelli, and Alex Steele. They also deal with much more mature subjects such as Amanda Todd's death[33] and the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting of 2012.",
