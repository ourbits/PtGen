Dalziel has a great deal of difficulty in accepting the situation and Abbie's family has mixed feelings about her return, especially one of her two brothers who is simply not prepared to accept her claim. DNA testing confirms her identity but the police soon have a murder investigation on their hands when Abbie is found dead.
