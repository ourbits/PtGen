    "introduction": "The film was shot in a single take, without any special effects or stuntmen, with the director driving the car.The idea for this film came to Claude Lelouch after hiring a gyro stabilized camera mount for a film he was working on at the time.While Claude Lelouch refuses to say who the driver was (although believed to be an F1 driver of the time) the car was his own Ferrari 275 GTB.The film is nine minutes long because the film cartridge in the camera could only hold 10 minutes of film and it was taken in a single shot.There was no confirmation of who was driving or what car he was driving. Sources variously claim the car to be either a Le Mans Matra 675, Ferrari 275 GTB, or, more recently an Alpine A110.Lelouch was arrested shortly after the film was screened but was later released without charge.The route taken in the film is 10.42 km long (6.48 mi). It takes the driver 7:57 to cover that distance, giving him an average speed of 78.64 km/h (48.86 mph).",
