    "introduction": "Ben Rubin, a young Israeli internist vying for the position of surgeon, learns that his internship has been terminated and he has been chosen to accompany Abraham Lazar, the hospital administrator and his wife, Dori on a trip to India. Dori is 50 years old, actually the exact age of Ben's mother. In India, with Ben's help, the couple intends to retrieve their ailing sick daughter, who is stuck in a Buddhist monastery in a far off and remote village. They intend to bring her back to Tel-Aviv in order to save her life. This journey awakens in Ben an erotic passion that dares to destroy his tidy world as he pursues an illicit love affair, not with the administrator's daughter, but with his wife, Dori.",
