    "introduction": "Sissy Spacek was directed by her husband Jack Fisk in 1981's Raggedy Man. Spacek plays a divorced mother of two who tries to go it alone in mid-1940s Texas. Shunned by the \"respectable\" townsfolk because of her marital breakup, Spacek must endure the unwanted attentions of every low-life man in the community. Enter Eric Roberts, a young sailor who becomes both friend and protector to Spacek and her sons. Once Roberts is called to active duty, however, Spacek is supposedly left at the mercy of the menacing \"raggedy man\"-a scuzzy ragpicker, played by Sam Shepard, whose intentions aren't what they seem. Leisurely paced for most of its running time, Raggedy Man takes a disturbing violent turn in its last half hour. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi",
