    "introduction": "The movements in the sky are written on an old map made of precious stones and kept in the bottom of the most ancient trunk in a forgotten temple. When the dance of the planets described in the old map takes place, something exceptional is bound to happen. Melkhior, the last of the wise man, initiated to the Prophecy of Light detected that the dance had already begun. So he decides to start the walk. But the never-ending routes in the arid desert, in a world punished by the war between Babylons and Romans, only an old blind man and an orphan seem to believe in the language of the stars.Also known as La Estrella de Belen (The Star of Bethlehem), the story is a very original interpretation of the biblical Three Kings (aka, Three Wise Men) and their quest to locate the baby Jesus.",
