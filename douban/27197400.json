    "introduction": "Freshly hatched MTV presenter 'Bluebell Welch' grabs viewers with her unique comic approach to interviewing music celebrities, bands, fans and confused members of the public. Quite how she got the job remains somewhat of a mystery - each interview she conducts is an utter shambles. She is a massive music geek, who knows an unhealthy amount about pop culture and the music world's biggest stars. Her obsessions get the better of her when face to face with her favorite performers- adding a freakishly dark, twisted edge to each meeting. Whilst adoring the stars she meets, she is an absolute ass to everyone else, shouting at her crew and challenging other fans.",
