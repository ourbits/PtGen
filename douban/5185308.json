    "introduction": "Meg Louglin has been left in charge of her dis-functional family as they travel from Boston to Ireland to scatter their mother's ashes. While her Aunt Annie can't remember where to do the scattering, Meg struggles to keep her brother and sister from killing each other while helping jar Annie's memory, and find a missing poet. Barely holding onto her sanity, Meg meets Daniel. A local horse breeder - too handsome, too sexy, but just the right kind of helpful. A road trip through coastal Ireland, this comedy follows a romance, a moon-shining operation, and eventually rainbows to find the right place.",
