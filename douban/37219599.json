    "introduction": "Gregg Wallace visits a factory which produces a staggering 2,000,000 tins of festive chocolate assortments a year. Cherry Healey travels to Germany where she joins a crew of ornament decorators, applying glitter and paint to glass Santas. In the UK, she goes behind the scenes at the Royal Mail as the Christmas stamps are printed. She also learns some skills for perfecting gingerbread whilst produces a gingerbread factory complete with biscuit versions of her co-presenters. Historian Ruth Goodman is on the trail of the Christmas turkey. She also comes face to face with the precursor to the pantomime dame - an 18th-century clown.",
