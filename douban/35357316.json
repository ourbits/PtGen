    "introduction": "Charles Gounod from Paris Marguerite \", inspired by Goethe's famous literary masterpiece, became a real sensation at its premiere on March 19, 1859 in Paris. Of Goethe's librettists, Jules Barbier and Michel Carré, used essentially a plot skeleton and several lyrics, but Gounod's musical conception of the theme was completely new, vital. He alternates the tenderness of love lyricism with dramatically tense scenes, with the ballet concept of the delightful Valpuržina night and there is an angelically transparent redemption of Markéta. Director Petr Weigl portrayed all these nuances of the literary and especially musical view of the new relationship between man and man with supreme poetics in his 1973 filmmaking and cast the unrelenting Magda Vášáryová and the manly Milan Kňažek, to whom soprano Marta Boháčová and tenor Jiří Zahradníček. You will hear Gounod's most famous opera in a Czech translation by Eva Bezděková",
