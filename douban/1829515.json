    "introduction": "The Cube, Jim’s program produced as part of NBC’s Experiment in Television series was written by Jim and Jerry Juhl back in 1966. While opposite from the visual style of Jim’s manic short Time Piece, The Cube explored similar themes related to free will and how the mind interprets the surrounding world. There was little interest in the script at first, and Jim and Jerry tried their hand at another script the following year, Tale of Sand, which married the visuals of Time Piece with the ideas of The Cube.",
