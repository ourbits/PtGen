    "introduction": "Dr. Faust, learned scholar from the 16th century, wanted more than what he could learn in books. He wanted more power, more glory, and more appeal to lure a young Gretchen. So he made a deal with Mephisto, the devil's servant. Satisfied, he grew in stature and was able to seduce the maiden. But the unintended consequences of this union came back to haunt not only him... but the entire Western World since Goethe wrote his version in 1806. Written by Steven Ritz-Barr",
