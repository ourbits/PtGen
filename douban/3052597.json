    "introduction": "Chronic is an experimental narrative about a young woman who began mutilating herself as a girl to cope with her bitter mid-western life. The lush optically-printed scenes take Gretchen's point of view from her punk youth, a stay in a mental hospital, and her release into the big city. Scripted scenes are inter-spliced with documentary and found footage, illustrating the culture Gretchen lives in, her inner world and relationships from her birth to her final day.",
