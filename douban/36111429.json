    "introduction": "Queen Elizabeth II was Britain's longest-reigning monarch. She lived her whole life in the public eye yet she remained an enigmatic figure throughout. The Queen never gave interviews but there was one way we could discover what was deeply important to her - through her speeches. This film looks back at the Queen's annual Christmas Day messages, and the handful of momentous occasions when the Queen made rare special addresses and spoke directly to the nation at times of crisis, commemoration and celebration.",
