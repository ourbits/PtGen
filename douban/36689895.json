    "introduction": "The film is set in Tuscany, in Rufina (Fi) where the stories of several characters intertwine.There is Count Baldacci who is forced to give up his winery because he cannot produce good wine; his son Leonardo who thinks only of squandering the family fortune; a secret son of the count, also a wine producer who does not know who his real father is; and a Milanese faccendiere who, together with three fake oenologists, wants to swindle the count and steal his estate and his fortune.We find stories of love and redemption, of friendships lost and found. All described with classic Tuscan humor but also with a lot of emotion. In short, a comedy with its landscapes, its wines and its chatter.",
