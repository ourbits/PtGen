At home, his peaceful relationship with his mother is disrupted by his mother's new acquaintance. In the most sensitive phase of his life, Tereza enters his path. Despite their social differences, they develop a liking for each other. Soon teenage games spiral out of control with a simulated kidnapping, culminating in a runaway from home.They board a train and a series of small adventures pursue until they get lost in a labyrinth of endless freedom. The attraction of desperation turns into the taste of loneliness and fear of the unknown and emotional outbursts begin to drown in the loss of illusions.",
