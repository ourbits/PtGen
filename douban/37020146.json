Five-year-old Zosia and her mother, despite their poor financial situation, are trying to prepare a traditional family Christmas Eve, and they can be helped by Robert - a lonely policeman on Christmas duty who, out of pure need of his heart, wants to do something good for someone. This magical time is also a chance for a man to spend Christmas again with his old love - provided, of course, the woman in his life finds a moment of peace, taking care of the crazy and unpredictable residents of the \"Happy End\" nursing home. May the magic of Christmas and the magic of love prevail.—G",
