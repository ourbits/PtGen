    "introduction": "There is no good day to announce a split – especially not one that was planned as an anniversary celebration. But Lucia doesn’t want to give up on her husband Giovanni. In her spontaneous struggle for her husband’s heart, she involves not only friends but also a filmmaker named Eros, who films the diverging couple’s every moment with his partner. What was originally intended to be a documentary about freelance filmmakers becomes a testament to the everyday problems in the relationships of big-city couples. And in the same way that no decision in a relationship can ever be considered final, dividing the protagonists into villains and heroes would be short-sighted. This film, which examines all the different kinds of love and its unpredictability in particular – with Billie Holiday’s sad “Good Morning Heartache” strewn throughout – represents the young blood of Italian cinema. Despite the attractive moviemaking milieu, the film is not cast in the resplendent light we know from gossip columns.",
