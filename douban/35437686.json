    "introduction": "An expedition sets off on a trip through the Pamir Mountains. On a journey from Osh, in Kirgizstan, via the Hindu Kush, all the way to Dushanbe, a camera team films the natives. The footage shows them pursuing various activities, such as prospecting for gold or smoking opium in Tajikistan or consuming dairy products in Kirgizstan. However, even in these remote territories the new Soviet hegemony is increasingly making its presence felt, with schools and busts of Lenin, for instance. This documentary film shows a region in transition that has yet to break completely with its time-honoured traditions.",
