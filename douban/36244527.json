    "introduction": "In this recent offering, filmmaker Miryam Charles initiates a conversation on the role of the human body, its significance, and what it represents in society. Several women join the discussion, deconstructing the role of the racialized female body in public and private spaces. The film was inspired by BOW’T TRAIL and the BOW’T-Tio'tia:ke show, created by choreographer Rhodnie Désir, which explores the various rhythmic cultures and traditions in six countries. The different voices we hear in Chemins croisés are accompanied by dance movements that evoke the power and responsibilities of bodies and words, which are political instruments and vehicles despite themselves.",
