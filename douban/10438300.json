Bluto manages to make Popeye look bad several times, eventually winning a ring at the ball toss and taking her up in his balloon. Of course, he tries to get fresh with her, and Popeye comes to the rescue with the help of some fireworks. The hot air balloon gets a bit too hot, putting Olive in even more danger.",
