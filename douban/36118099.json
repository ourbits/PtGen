    "introduction": "Three films that explore the raw emotions of fractured family and complicated romance. 'Outside In' (Felicity Price, Jack Finsterer), 'Hapless' (Maeve Dermody, Ben Winspear, Lindsay Farris) and 'The Last Goodbye' (Natasha Bassett, Samantha Rebillet). Combined as a triptych, 'Love Lust Longing' explores a world of women and their need for independence, each struggling to find a balance between nurturing others while empowering themselves. Filmed in Sydney and Paris, the trio of stories present universal experience within a diverse cultural context.",
