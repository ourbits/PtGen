    "introduction": "The Starting Line captures the rhythms of a day at the Tijuana border crossing. But it’s not just any day: as people go through their routines, they listen to the local news report on Donald Trump’s inauguration. By taking the usual viewpoint—American broadcasters talking about life on the Mexican border—and flipping it on its head, The Starting Line presents an unexpected view of America’s capitol, as it appears from just over the border.",
