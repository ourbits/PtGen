    "introduction": "In the film, “Grace’s life has been a series of disappointments. Addicted to morphine, the nurse (Anna Hindman) doesn’t have much reason to fight back when Evienne (Chloe Carroll), a vampire, kidnaps her. Deep below Philadelphia, Evienne has preyed on the city for eighty years from a series of forgotten subway tunnels. Now, with her still-human son Henry (Robert Picardo) dying of cancer, Evienne has nowhere to turn for help but from the innocents who are normally nothing more than dinner. Grace and Evienne develop a strange bond that caring for the same person creates, or is the vampire just beguiling the nurse, twisting reality, and lowering her inhibitions?",
