    "introduction": "Fysioterapeut Julika is young, attractive, mother of two cute children - and widow. Two years ago her husband Michi died in an accident. Julika still misses him sorely, even speaks regularly to his mailbox. Nevertheless, she embarks on an affair head over heels with the easy-going bicycle city guide Konstantin. Suddenly life is full of lightness again, full of magic and adventure. But is this really love? After her great love Michi, can there be a new great love for Julika? For her loving but sometimes abusive parents-in-law Georg and Christa, the case is clear: the affair with Konstantin can only be an \"animal\" aberration. Georg and Christa were very supportive of Julika and the children after Michi's death, the family is very close and even lives together on the same property. But with Konstantin, this whole well-established family structure falls into disarray. And how sure can Julika Konstantins be, who has never really wanted to commit himself in his life?",
