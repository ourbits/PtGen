This exciting midnight performance was recorded at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on October 1, 2009.Act One features favorite songs by Ms. Minnelli, including Cabaret, Maybe This Time, What Makes a Man a Man, and My Own Best Friend. A first act highlight is Liza's special rendition of the Palace Medley, originally sung by her mother, Judy Garland, at the Palace Theatre in 1951. Liza adds a new personal musical introduction to the fond remembrance of famous vaudevillians. Act Two is very special tribute to Liza's godmother, Kay Thompson, a groundbreaking singer-dancer, songwriter, and vocal arranger/coach at the MGM studios in the 1940 s.",
