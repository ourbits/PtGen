After the skipper has been hypnotised on land, he gets the idea that he might have hypnotic abilities himself, which could be used to separate Kik and his own daughter. The plan is put into action, but Bims has more regrets coming! It turns out that his newly discovered superpowers are even stronger than he himself had dared to hope.",
