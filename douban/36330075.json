    "introduction": "The 2D abstract hand-drawn animation comes from Na Li’s improvisational drawings inspired by a piece of music. She visualized the sound through automatic drawing, creating the film in a semiconscious state. Na drew symbols to represent the sounds and instruments she heard, using abstract drawings to translate a poem.",
