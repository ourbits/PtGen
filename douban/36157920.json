    "introduction": "杰基·罗恩居住在位于特拉维夫郊区院子里的一所集装箱房屋里。近四十年来，户主玛格丽特在这里收留了众多无家可归的男孩，给予了他们温暖和爱。虽然杰基已经长成少年，但从未离开过。直到某天他发现收容所面临关停的风险，于是他决定以各种方式为此一战，甚至被迫做出极端行为，以拯救这座街头生活的最后庇护所。In the heart of Tel-Aviv's Neve Tzedek neighborhood stands an old house that operates as a shelter for youth from broken homes. Jackie, a young man who finds himself running the shelter after the sudden death of its legendary founder, discovers that the old house actually belongs to the municipality of Tel-Aviv, and has been bought by a businessman who's planning to demolish the house and build a boutique hotel on its ruins. Together with the house's at-risk youth, and with the help of a social worker who comes on board, Jackie launches a relentless struggle against the municipality's representatives, to save the house, which, for the youth it shelters-- is their last refuge, their last lifeline.",
