    "introduction": "On April 20th, 2012, more than two-dozen musicians played a concert in Austin, TX. We Walk the Line: A Celebration of the Music of Johnny Cash, featured an all-star list of talent paying tribute to Cash's 80th birthday. These artists interpreted some of Cash's most iconic songs. The inspiring concert presented a wide spectrum of legendary musicians including veteran country artists (Willie Nelson, Ronnie Dunn), contemporary icons (Pat Monahan of Train, Evanescence's Amy Lee) and Grammy Award Winners (Sheryl Crow, the Carolina Chocolate Drops). An all-star band led by Grammy Award-winning producer Don Was - which included Buddy Miller, Kenny Aronoff, Ian McLagan, and Greg Leisz - backed these once-in-a-lifetime performances.",
