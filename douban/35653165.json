    "introduction": "In this mystery-comedy, a young chauffeur investigates the disappearance of a client. He is aided by his Italian teacher, a homeless estate agent, and an artist who uses random stock photos to illustrate her dreams. Everything seems like a clue in this slightly absurdist world, but to what?It all becomes even more strange thanks to the work of Anglo-Spanish musician Hyperpotamus, which fills almost the entire soundtrack and obliterates background noises or dialogue. We can only generate our own narrative by watching glances and gestures. Every succession of images is unexpected: we see men plucking their eyebrows, an estate agent reading Jordan Peterson, the Egyptian Imhotep who studied the brain.And, then there's the mystery of the doorway effect: the psychological phenomenon of forgetting what you are doing as soon as you walk into a room. Inmotep explains how all this interacts, or doesn’t, with fun asides, confounding leaps of reasoning, and optical illusions.",
