    "introduction": "What if you could zap yourself from your boring rainy humdrum life in a strict boarding school in Ireland, to a sun-drenched beach resort in Australia whenever you felt like it? Or if you had enough of the sunshine in Australia, you could simply choose to go through a door which came out in a totally different world in Ireland. Well that’s what 14 year olds Hannah and Brett can do, since Brett discovered a portal in the old house where he lives in Australia. The series follows their adventures and mishaps as they become fish out of water in different hemispheres and try to adjust to, and get the best out of both worlds.",
