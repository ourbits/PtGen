This forced most of them to take up demeaning jobs or live mundane lives. Former wrestler turned janitor, Zangief (Mike Fass) suggests to former fighter turned cab driver Dhalsim (Sean T. Krishnan) that they need to start another tournament in New York and reunite its competitors. However, several Street Fighters, as well as some others scheme to use the tournament to their advantage.",
