    "introduction": "The film portrays one year in the life of Hilda Ha, a wild and free German woman. She is not the kind of person to stand with a big poster at a Friday For Future demonstration. Instead she saves the planet in a quiet way, living off-grid with her one-year old child in Southern Estonia in a self-built tiny house with no water or electricity. Although it seems extreme, for her it’s the most natural way to live.",
