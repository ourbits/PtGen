Through rare recordings, exclusive interviews and outtakes of behind-the-scenes antics, \"Stooges: The Men behind the Mayhem\" tells the pure, uncensored Stooge story--from the early vaudeville years with Shemp and Ted Healy, through the golden years at Columbia Pictures with Curly, to the final feature films with Curly Joe DeRita, \"the last Stooge.\" Whether you're fascinated by the unrestrained id, or just enjoy the good, clean humor of pliers applied to the nose, you'll find something to love in this in-depth look at America's most beloved madcaps The Three Stooges!",
