    "introduction": "A motorway under the rain, a railway line, demonstrations in Barcelona, images of war, a rock concert, a screening of Zanj Revolution… Commissioned by the Centre Pompidou, Où en êtes-vous, Tariq Teguia? could be regarded like a random mix in the manner of Prévert, if it were not about the life of Tariq Teguia. Always in movement, it is a real essay, weaved from his struggles and his dreams.",
