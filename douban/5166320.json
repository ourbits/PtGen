    "introduction": "When Gus Bazookas made his own fitness center he definitely not thought that his sons, Angus and Judah, might one day fight for control. However, after Gus early death (triggered by viewing a nude racquetball play) the continuing future of the company gets unsure and the brothers make a bet to see who will take sole control of the gym. When Judah and his henchmen lodge to sabotage and secret cams, Angus and his workers consider a sexy renovation is their only opportunity to save the fitness. The gorgeous gym administrator Christine and sexy physical instructor Jackie get a little assistance from their buddies to increase the stakes and turn up the heat with strip exercise courses, an aquatics coach focusing on the breast stroke, and a sexy calendar shoot. Meanwhile, Angus desires about the fantastic accountant Natalie, the FBI moves in, Janitor shouts obscenities, and the razing ball jeopardise. This humorous, unique comedy is a should see, upcoming cult classic!",
