    "introduction": "早期的巫毒纪录片，在世界各地拍摄，有非洲土著，南美安第斯，巴西亚马逊等地的实景。http://www.moviegoods.com/movie_poster/green_magic_1955.htmDisturbing voodoo documentary. remember seeing the pain on the theatre manager's face as some disturbing animal sacrifice scenes were being shown. From what I recalled, it was well made, had lots of vivid imagery and sounds. It's been too long since I've seen it to give it a good critique, but from what I recall, it was a pretty interesting movie, if a little disturbing at times. There's a lot more gore in movies today, but you knew that in this movie, it's real.",
