    "introduction": "\"Menagerie\" is a drama which takes place in the early 1990s, in one Serbian village near the coast of river Drina. It is a story about moral and historical breakdown of one country, located at a milieu separated from urban life, in an area that lives on specific rules and relationships between people. Srna, daughter of Strain, the most powerful man in the village, is promised for a wife to Jovan. Jovan is the son of a local forester Tadija, who, in return, allows Strain poaching and illegal cutting of village wood. Although there is attraction between Srna and Jovan, they still don't want to be married by the wish of their fathers. Suddenly Petar, the ex-forester who was seven years in jail for killing Strain's older son, returns to the village. His return changes lives of all characters in this story indicating the uncertain end of it.",
