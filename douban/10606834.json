The Teller and the Truth tells the story of the disappearance of Francis Wetherbee, a beautiful young bank teller missing since her car was found submerged in a river in 1974. Filmmaker Andrew Shapter (Before the Music Dies, Happiness Is) digs into the forty year old cold case that sparked the imagination of her hometown of Smithville, Texas and beyond. Did she drown? Commit Suicide? Was she kidnapped? Or is there another answer? The film combines a documentary style with modern narrative interpretation in order to uncover what about Francis Wetherbee is myth and what is fact.",
