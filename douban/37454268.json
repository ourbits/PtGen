Experience the impressive prosperity and ever-changing power dynamics in Members Only: Palm Beach, coming to Netflix this December.Set within the exclusive enclaves of Palm Beach County, the eight-episode first season will follow a group of women navigating the unspoken rules, inherited traditions, and high-stakes hierarchies of America’s most rarefied social circles. In this manicured world of privilege and private clubs, reputations are built over brunch and alliances shift over champagne. While wealth is ubiquitous, power, influence, and access are the true currency.",
