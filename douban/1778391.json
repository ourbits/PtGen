    "introduction": "It's one of the best films I have ever seen. The story, the acting, the blue colors in the film... it was gripping. The end was one of the most heartbreaking scene's I have ever seen. I cried a river. Very beautiful and emotional... The story is about Fermin, a man that worked as a bus driver and was a member of a workers-union in Argentina. Supposedly he's been arrested for that fact during the Military Junta and was a Missing Person for several years. And then, one day he appears naked on the streets of Buenos Aires again. Fermin suffers from amnesia. He doesn't know what has happen to him for all those missing years. But he remembers his life before his disappearance. Fermin decides to go to see the woman he was supposed to marry, before he got arrested, but she does not recognize him. The story is not about his \"missing years \" but about what happens when people re-appear when everybody thinks they're dead.",
