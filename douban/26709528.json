After his father finds some questionable magazines in his room, this devout Christian will go to any lengths to get his son to find the light and 'perform' the way a man should. Sean is introduced to Katie, a prostitute that understands the stigmas of modern society and helps him see the true light that is within him. 'Pretty Boy' is meant to inspire our youth to follow their hearts, to seek out their true family if '...the family they were born into isn't the family they're meant to be with.'",
