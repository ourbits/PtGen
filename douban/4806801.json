    "introduction": "Shot on a shoestring budget by an Italian company, this 1986 drama looks like 1979. The two main characters, recent Italian immigrants Rudy and Johnny, troll discos for sex and meet a spectacular model, played by Andrea Thompson, who invites them back to her hotel for some three-way action. Unknown to one of her studs (Johnny), the session is being viewed by a select clientèle of rich voyeurs. When he learns of this set-up, his relationship with roommate Rudy deteriorates. Johnny moves out and finds work as an actor, but his past follows him. The woman seeks him out, but not to apologise for deceiving him. The voyeurs want to see them in action again, and are not above blackmail and even violence to get what they want... Andrea Thompson makes an exciting sex siren but most of this low budget soaper is deadly dull, with long winded scenes that seem only to fill time between nude scenes, rather than elevating the level of intrigue and decadence that is being striven for. The dramatic moments are poorly shaped, making the characters' motivations unconvincing and the resulting actions unbelievable and seemingly random. This is weak drama. Only for dedicated Andrea Thompson droolers.",
