Its followers strive to reinstate order. But not everybody accepts to succumb to a process of civilization: the dissidents are preparing for a revolution! We will tell the story of two free spirits of the jungle who strive to find their place in the world. Yaya is an intelligent 15 years old mixed-race girl with an uncouth attitude. Lennie is a 8-foot tall man in his 30s with a mental handicap. Yaya takes care of Lennie. Lennie takes care of Yaya.",
