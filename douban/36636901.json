    "introduction": "Director David McVicar's original-period vision for this Mozartian gem allows its genius to speak for itself, offering a 'mesmerising, sensitive...outstanding' portrayal of Enlightenment-era fascination with the East that is both 'exquisitely acted and sung', featuring a Konstanze and a Belmonte sung with 'finesse and brauva' and a 'sensationally voiced' Osmin (The Guardian ★★★★★). Comic relief in Glyndebourne's 'brilliant production' is provided by 'beautifully sung live-wire performances' of Pedrillo and Blonde, and Robin Ticciati leads the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment through a restored, authenic rendition of the critical score with 'lovely fizz' and 'poignant gravitas' (The Independent).",
