    "introduction": "John Lymes, well known, respected scientist and Nobel peace prize winner, is accompanied by former famed Astronaut, Steve Curry, to discover a mysterious root embedded in the ice layer on Mars. This root contains high concentrations of antioxidants and other rich undiscovered minerals of power. An evil race of shape-shifters is in the process of using this root for personal gain and for their fountain of youth. As the Nephilians gather a group of Superhuman Astro-Hybrids, they are ordered to abduct healthy humans to help them build a bigger army, destroy the human race and conquer the galaxy for eternity.- Written by Robert Erniso",
