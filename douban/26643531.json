    "introduction": "Avez-vous déjà vu... ? (Have you ever seen...?) is a weird French animated series. Each episode lasts one minute or less, and presents something that you have probably never seen. Like spitting houses. Or a Space soap opera. Or a serial-killer egg.150 episodes were released, starting in 2006. The narrator of the series is Alain Chabat, who is almost the king of nonsensical humor.",
