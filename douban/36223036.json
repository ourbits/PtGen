    "introduction": "Orhun is a successful businessman who was raised in a wealthy but loveless family along with his twin sister Nihan, younger sister Nurşah and their cold, distant mother Afife. Some time ago, Nihan left to do volunteer work as a doctor in Eritrea, but recently she has been impossible to contact, and her family is worried about her.Orhun decides to go after his twin sister and bring her back home. While looking for his sister, he comes across Hira, a poor girl living the life of a prisoner at the hands of traffickers. When they find out that Nihan has been poisoned and killed by a local gang, Orhun breaks down. When it emerges that it was actually Hira who was set up by the gang and poisoned his sister, Orhun hatches an evil revenge plan: he will take Hira home with him, but rather than saving her from life as a prisoner he will make things even worse for her…Things get even more complicated when Afife tells her son that she actually lied to her children about their father’s death for years. Orhun decides to marry Hira to drive his mother crazy - she hates people of lower status and she’s obsessed with “pure blood”. Will this marriage imprison Firuze into a more unbearable slavery, or will the couple find redemption after paying all their dues?",
