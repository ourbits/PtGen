    "introduction": "After a blow-up with a kidnapping suspect during a formal interview, Dalziel goes on a fortnight's enforced leave leaving him to ponder whether he will return at all. DI Pascoe and DS Milligan look into the death of Efrona Davis, whose body is washed up on shore. She had a date after work the previous evening with Gavin Oldham, who has gone missing. Unfortunately, the DCI assigned to the case is preoccupied with a diamond robbery. Efrona was part of a reality TV talent competition and was hoping to have a career in show business. With Dalziel's return to duty, the investigation focuses on Rowan Priestly, a has-been comedian who organized the talent show and Julian Finch who had recently become Efrona's agent. The case turns out to be more complex than first imagined when they establish links to another major investigation.",
