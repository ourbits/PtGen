    "introduction": "IN THE LAND OF BROTHERS is the intertwined story of Afghan refugees of Iran, in three decades. Starting in 1990, there is a ten-year gap between each episode. Masoumeh: An Afghan woman is searching for her missing husband who hasn't come home in two days, in the middle of a riot in Mashhad. Her daughter Hanieh is losing her hearing and wonders where her father is. Mohammad: A teenage Afghan boy is constantly being captured by the police and taken to the station for forced labor. His family works precariously in greenhouses, and he needs to find a solution on his own. Leila: A female janitor finds her husband dead before the new year's big celebration. As she and her son are illegally living in Iran, she needs to bury her husband without the house owners noticing, otherwise she might be deported. Qasem: The brother of Leila finds out his son had been killed in a proxy war in Syria. The government wants to grant citizenship to the Afghan families that've lost sons. The man struggles to reveal this to his wife Hanieh.",
