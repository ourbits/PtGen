    "introduction": "本片是2008年戛纳电影节导演双周单元的闭幕影片。该片的24岁的纽约作家－导演的银幕处女作。影片描写一位有强烈好奇心的年轻妇女的大胆的行窃行为.A curious and lost Eleonore looks for something everywhere, even in the bags of strangers who find themselves sadly smiling onlywell after she's left their lives. They owe her their thanks.Eleonore is a pickpocket, a con artist and a thief. She'll pilfer your purse, your car, a handful of grapes or a litter of kittens.She robs out of need, curiosity or maybe just for the hell of it. From the hipster bars of the Lower East Side to the cages ofCentral Park Zoo, Eleonore steals her way through life in New York City - plus the occasional road trip to Boston - with afreewheeling spontaneity that may lead her to most unexpected score of all. Eleonore Hendricks and director Joshua Safdie star inthis breezily lo-fi look at slacker larceny - co-written by Hendricks and Safdie and shot guerilla-style on the streets of NYC -that rocked The Director's Fortnight at Cannes to become one of the most talked-about indie sensations of the year.",
