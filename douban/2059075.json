    "introduction": "A stern, raw, one breath-timing journey, and the even darker conclusion. One picture, three women, so many sorrow - after all the unsolvable mystery. It's more than a film, more than an work of art, it's just like a poem without words, something incomprehensible, something personal called life. I saw this film 10 years ago, and I still remember it, because it's so powerful and awesome. That's why I really love the art movies, i'ts timeless, worthy and beautiful. The director was inspired by a photo, and he makes a whole world not with colors, but passion. Grab it,check it, and go over again and again......",
