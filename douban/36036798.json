    "introduction": "Unità mobile di soccorso is an occasionally grotesque road movie hovering between drama and irony which paints a harsh yet true-to-life portrait of four people, who are sometimes unaware of having embarked upon a journey towards the outer reaches of life. Toni (Ferrara) and Champagnino (Lattanzi) live in a small town in Abruzzo where nothing ever happens. Champagnino drives an ambulance while Toni is a medic. One day, they’re asked to drive Emir (Franek) - a patient in need of special treatment - to Serbia. They’re accompanied by Emir’s daughter Maria (Claisse). During the journey, Toni, Champagnino and Maria realise they don’t know the whole truth and that Emir’s decision over his own life will no doubt change their own.",
