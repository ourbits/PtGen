    "introduction": "The Mayas created the only system of writing in Mesoamerica that represented a spoken language. Visually very beatiful, the inscriptions have come down to us on stelas, lintels, pottery and codices, the sacred books they used to record their wisdom. after a period of great cultural effervescence that lasted more than a thousand years, the Maya civilization went into decline. The cities and ceremonial  centers were abandoned and Maya writing remained an enigma for almost a millenium",
