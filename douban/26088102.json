    "introduction": "Father Sam Ryan, (Michael Murphy), an aging Roman Catholic Priest living contentedly at a Niagara Falls parish, receives a letter forcing his complacent life into a downward spiral. The letter, from \"Christopher,\" confronts him about an incident that happened 40 years ago. Father Sam was a young, charismatic priest, serving a remote, Northern Ontario parish. Christopher was a 14-year-old adolescent, whom Sam mentored. The letter asks Father Sam for the truth: what did take place all those years ago? Were lines blurred or crossed? What choices were made?",
