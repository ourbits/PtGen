    "introduction": "Three people, living on the edge: Imike, Böbe and Irén, a strange little family in the 21st century Hungary. Imike is a gypsy pimp, his girlfriend, the Romanian-Hungarian Böbe and their flatmate Irén, are prostitutes. These three are trying to find their way in the ensuing chaos after the collapse of the Socialist regime, with Imike getting into trouble about owing money to a drug dealer. The film tells the story of the askewed relationship of Imike and Böbe, showing episodes of their life mercilessly realistic and grotesque, full of sex, violence and shady business. However, the film isn't only about social commentary: it tells a story of rage, love, blind instinct and no-way-out situations.",
