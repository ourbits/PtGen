    "introduction": "Days after 9/11, Blerim Skoro was recruited from a Manhattan prison by the CIA and FBI. For over a decade, he was America's infidel mole, roaming the Middle East as a spy deep inside al-Qaeda. Skoro lived in constant danger amongst terrorists, leaking intelligence to the US government in the desperate hope of getting a Green Card and a ticket back to his family in Brooklyn. This is the story of how one man became tangled in a complex geopolitical web, how he risked everything to protect his family, and how he was cruelly betrayed by the country he strived to defend. Despite focusing on themes of espionage and terrorism, “The Accidental Spy” is essentially a love story centred around a family of New Yorkers who never gave up hope.",
