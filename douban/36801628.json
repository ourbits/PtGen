This legendary feud between the Moores and the Pogociellos, the owners of the respective establishments, deeply affects thirty-five-year-old widow Amanda Moore. Having initially worked at Mimi’s under her mother’s guidance, Amanda stirred controversy by marrying Frank Pogociello and joining Frannie’s team. Seeking an escape from the ongoing conflict, Amanda turns to Food Wars, a reality TV restaurant competition promising a $100,000 prize.As the narrative progresses, Amanda’s plea not only thrusts both families into the spotlight but also adds fuel to the flames of long-buried animosities. Meanwhile, Amanda’s sister Mae Moore, a Brooklyn-based organizational guru, reluctantly returns to Kansas to revive Mimi’s fading reputation on Food Wars. As the competition unfolds, family secrets unravel, forcing the sisters to confront a pivotal choice: clash against each other or stand together in defense of their shared heritage.",
