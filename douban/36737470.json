    "introduction": "Iranian filmmaker Narges Kalhor wants to remove “Shahid”–a name passed down from a great-grandparent, meaning “martyr”–from her surname. She hires an actress to perform in the film of this process, but there are obstacles at every turn: she is haunted by her great-grandfather, the German bureaucracy is impossible, and the actors revolt. An exuberant and highly unconventional political comedy.",
