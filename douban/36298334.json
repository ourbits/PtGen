    "introduction": "Two youths bicker their way up the East Coast and through a discomforting and poignant transition into adulthood. Using still images, animation, Super-8 and an experimental score composed and performed by the filmmaker, The Drive North subverts the typical coming-of-age tale with social commentary, humor and an understated identity-politics slant. This savvy short demonstrates the skills of the next generation of media makers, seamlessly incorporating an astute sense of self-reflection, rebellion and family relationships.",
