Of course, everyone else is to blame for this. He sells his house and his company, takes the dog to the shelter, and gives it his fortune. But he doesn't die - misdiagnosis. And so he has to return completely penniless to a life that neither wants nor needs him. Suddenly he is dependent on other people. That changes him - whether he wants to or not.",
