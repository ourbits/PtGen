    "introduction": "A Danish man has lost his faith. Previously religious, he has come to doubt and goes to Jerusalem to regain his confidence. In Jerusalem, he meets modern-day prophets of three religions: Islam, Judaism, and Christianity. Through conversations with these men, dedicated to helping other people, he tries to learn about his own ideals and the contradiction between belief and reasoning. But not only the long conversations but also the life of Jerusalem and the prophets is to teach him something. Written by B-rapunSaario",
