    "introduction": "City councilor Victor mysteriously disappears in Sao Paulo during a day that turns night because of meteorological phenomena and smoke from forest fires. Weeks go by, and Fabio grows closer to Louise. He is a trans man and a caregiver for the elderly. She is ill and living far from her family in France. While aiding Louise (a cis woman), Fabio's relationship with her matures into understanding, affection, and exchange. He becomes her rock. Fabio's memories and dreams offer a closer look at his coming-of-age and his dilemmas about sexuality and gender. The story unfolds in a country with a polarized society and under political and financial turmoil. While Fabio must overcome the recent end of a romantic relationship, Louise feels the pangs of loneliness and her near death. Now Fabio and Louise have each other to rely on and learn to say their goodbyes. \"That Dark Day\" has won the \"Silver Rabbit Award\" - Audience's Choice for Best Brazilian Short Film - at MixBrasil Festival of Diversity Culture 2022.",
