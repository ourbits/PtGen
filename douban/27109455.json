    "introduction": "'Who is Alice' carries us on a darkly funny, compelling and sometimes cringe worthy journey into the highs and lows of what human beings will do to try to avoid pain and connect to happiness. Alice is a 35 year old actress desperately hanging on to her 'new young thing' career. She is willing to sacrifice almost everything in order to reach the top and this mind-bending story takes us down the rabbit hole with her. Alice meets Dick, a car salesman who is disillusioned with life and dreaming about becoming a spiritual teacher. Together with a renegade cast of misfit characters they hilariously and awkwardly tie themselves in knots as they find their 'way'. And where does that 'way' lead them? ... To exactly where they are supposed to be. 'Who is Alice' uses humor guided by the a little non-dual thinking to help us look at ourselves and life in a different way. If the insight strikes, your whole perspective can change, while 'in reality' nothing has to change. Written by Paul Smit",
