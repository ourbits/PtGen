As yet, however, Barbara is a minor , this relationship in the eyes of the environment reprehensible. After the first time the two have slept in a vacant house together, even feel a few kids, they might see Barbara as fair game and they try to rape her. Even with the parents, there are major problems. Above all, the fathers of the two are enemies for a long time. George's father came with a campaign of the early GDR \"workers into the country\" in the village, the idealism is now given way to bitterness, however, lethargy, especially given the substantive achievements of Barbara's father (the neighbor). This is mainly interested in money, otherwise blankly until primitive. Finally, a path that has found its opponents, the \"comrades\" to compromise and shows for George abuse to a minor. Even in school, there is little understanding. The school principal shall initiate disciplinary action, and George's future seems blocked, a study is no longer possible. Only the teacher stands on the porch, first two, and becomes a friend of Barbara.

A final verdict is given in the film is not known, however, the subsequent marriage of the lovers, for George, \"a small price\" was paid.",
