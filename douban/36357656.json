    "introduction": "Part of the job of day-to-day daydreaming is to constantly learn. From the imagined idea to the visible object, the films' rituals of creation are a slice of everybody's lifetime. We are here to experience the complicity of a collective, albeit intimate, work. To glimpse over the strange poetry released by gathering this group: how these personal universes are eager to merge into blind dialogue, to articulate in an not so obvious editing, to participate in a world being discovered and created before our eyes.",
