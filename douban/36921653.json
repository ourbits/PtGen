    "introduction": "Aimed at audiences 13 and older, the YA film is a sci-fi coming-of-age story  Penelope, the heroine from Homer’s The Odyssey. Set in a world inspired by ancient Greece, it will follow the seventeen-year-old as she attends an elite high school with other famous characters of lore, including Achilles, Helen, Circe, Agamemnon and Odysseus.Given the lofty social standing of the students, the atmosphere is highly competitive. While most of the kids are constantly trying to one-up each other, Penelope ignores the typical motivations of her peers and instead focuses on a mission given to her by her father, the King of Sparta, who has tasked the girl with freeing the people of Sparta from Athens’ imperial clutches.",
