    "introduction": "Memories of the Eichmann Trial includes reminiscences by trial witnesses, Holocaust survivors, Israelis of the second generation, and others who were directly involved in the Eichmann case. Prominent among them are Henryk Ross, a Polish Jew who, with the help of his wife Stefania, took clandestine photographs of life in the Lodz Ghetto while carrying out Nazi orders to record information about Jews on their way to the death camps; and Rafi Eitan, who led the operation to capture Eichmann in Argentina, in 1961. Broadcast only once on Israeli television in 1979, Memories of the Eichmann Trial was rediscovered and restored in 2011.",
