    "introduction": "\"Houdinis Hund\" is a Norwegian short which deserved the prize as the best short movie in Berlin International Film Festival.The title means \"The dog of Houdini\", you know the very well-known escapist Harry Houdini.Klara and Frederik are cousins and they waste their summer doing kid things like to steal a bone to a \"fearsome\" dog...which eventually is just a small lovable puppy dog.Frederik is an admirer of Houdini the Magician and asks Klara to tie his hands with a rude rope and to bury him under the sand of the beach where they are spending their holidays.He tries to untie his hands but will he manage to get it?Maybe he needs some help...maybe not. Is it magic or is it chance?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
