Pressured to wrap up the case, the intelligence service coaxes ailing lawyer Marus Steiner to serve as a fixer. Steiner's clean-up job brings him into the orbit of several characters, an idealist minister fighting the privatisation of water, the grieving family of the victim, an independent journalist, and a crude cop, all seeking to conceal or expose the truth.",
