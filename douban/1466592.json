    "introduction": "\"Every living thing that shares the planet with us has had to adapt and evolve over millions of years. Every flower, every insect, every animal is a miracle waiting to be discovered, a marvel to be respected and loved. But we like to replace them with our own inventions, served up by the magicians of advertising, the promoters of progress and over-consumption. Unfortunately, these inventions are outmoded all too quickly. They break down, often taking with them that which is essential to our lives and happiness, the elements needed to sustain the real miracles accomplished by nature.\"F.B.",
