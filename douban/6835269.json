    "introduction": "José María (50), Clara (18) and Norberto (18) have only two things in common: They are deafblind and they love the water. Actually they have something else, their uniqueness. We are all unique, true, but they are even more so. Jose Maria is an artist, a sculptor who lives with his family on the Galician coast, and whose disability has given him the gift of sublime touch, a superlative ability to mould forms. Clara is an amphibious being who lives between Madrid and the Cadiz coast, a rare species of deep-sea fish who relates to the surface and beyond based on secret, incomprehensible codes. Norberto was born in the Canary Islands and has spent most of his life living and studying at the ONCE School in Madrid.",
