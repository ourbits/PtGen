    "introduction": "Alim (35) has been working as a tailor apprentice for 15 years with his master Yakub (60). He keeps on living his life, stuck in between the atelier and his home. He is a person who is obsessed with necrophobia. In consequence, he hates to break out of the routine and keeps living his life in extreme monotony. He has the same rituals for every morning and night. In the morning, he starts his day by opening the store, watches TV or takes a nap until his master comes. In the evening, he goes back home with the coffee shop owner Kemal's car whom he lives in the same district with. One day by the TV news, he learns that LPG tanks in the cars might explode. Since then, each time he gets into the cab, he checks the trunk of the cab, in case if there's an LPG tank in the trunk. Every time he opens a trunk, an LPG tank comes back to haunt him. That's why he decides to move to a closer neighborhood, but this small change will be a milestone for him.",
