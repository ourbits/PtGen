    "introduction": "Gray can make the English language jump through hoops like none other. He recounts a number of events, tied together by his writing of a manuscript (the \"Monster\" of the title), some sad, some uproariously funny, all in his characteristic, sarcastic manner. If you liked \"Swimming to Cambodia\" you will love this one. I actually thought this was a bit more interesting and better told than \"Swimming to Cambodia\". A real masterpiece.",
