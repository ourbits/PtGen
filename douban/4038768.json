    "introduction": "Also known as Red Riding Hood, Year 2000, this Hungarian/Canadian co-production is not for children. Director Marta Meszaros again dwells upon the travails of women trapped in oppressive society. This time, the Red Riding Hood legend is used metaphorically within the framework of a quasi-futuristic storyline. The \"wolves\" are of the human variety, and \"friendly hunters\" few and far between.This is a weird and sometimes disturbing take-off on the beloved fairy tale. In this one, the main girl is far more whiny and petulant. She has a boyfriend (who is somehow able to come and go into the forest from the city with no visible means of transport) and she is able to communicate telepathically with the wolf. There is a sub-plot about the girl's divorced parents which doesn't really make sense and the film features a very odd development towards the end. The forest scenery is gorgeous and the film is professionally made but it's hard to tell if this was made for kids or not as it contains so many odd and questionable elements. It's definitely not the story that most people grew up with.",
