    "introduction": "In the late 1800s, somewhere in the West, two cowboys, the laconic Tar and the prolix Slope, sit by a daytime campfire eating beans. Their cattle are somewhere nearby. Slope begins to wonder about things, including a line about \"the child inside all of us,\" something a Chinese told them just before Tar shot him. Slope talks about skipping, something he hasn't done since he was a kid. He keeps talking, even through it's making Tar uncomfortable. Then Slope slips off his boots, stands up, and, indeed, starts to skip. What will Tar do? And what if they and their inner children aren't alone?",
