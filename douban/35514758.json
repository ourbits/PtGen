    "introduction": "A remote, one-horse town in Iceland. A female corpse lies in the black sand. The local authorities assume it was an accident; it would not be the first time that reckless tourists have fallen off an unsecured cliff. Police officer Anita, who has just returned to her hometown from Reykjavik, is the only one who smells a rat and stubbornly continues to investigate. When another woman turns up seriously injured, it becomes apparent that Anita is right. Monumental Icelandic vistas alternate with detailed observations of police work. Corpses stink and are heavy as lead, but at work the talk is also, or even above all, about relationships. Here, everyone knows everyone else, and everyone has a common past, one that seems to weigh heavily on Anita in particular.Creators Aldís Amah Hamilton, Ragnar Jónsson and Andri Óttarsson worked together with creator and director Baldvin Z to develop this unconventional crime series in which the protagonists, their concerns and interpersonal relationships are more important than the search for suspects.",
