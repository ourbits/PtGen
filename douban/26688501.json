The plan looks foolproof until his talking pet monkey Pablo runs off with the blueprints for the doctor's scheme. Pablo is discovered by boy genius Willy McBean, who decides to go back in time himself and undo the doctor's damage, if for no other reason than to keep from having to study history all over again.",
