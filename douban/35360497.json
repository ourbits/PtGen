    "introduction": "In a very different register is The Falling Sky, the latest from avant-garde master Peggy Ahwesh. Working with found footage of computer-generated actors and environments (taken mostly from Taiwanese animated news), Ahwesh compiles a kind of abbreviated, near-future disaster film. We are harmed by the depletion of the ozone layer, polar icecaps melt, and we are all implanted with microchips that turn our every moment into a data-gathering bonanza for Amazon and Facebook. By the end of Ahwesh’s film, the earth is uninhabitable and what’s left of the human race is floating in a space pod in suspended animation. Like a version of Craig Baldwin’s Tribulation 99 for our techno-horror moment, Ahwesh combines every worrisome prognostication into one grand doomsday scenario enacted by a collection of hapless avatars. We have met the Sims, and they are us.",
