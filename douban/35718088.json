    "introduction": "Papapapá is an experimental documentary about immigration. Looking at the potato, which was first cultivated in Peru as an Inca food staple, Papapapá paints a picture of a vegetable which has traveled, and been transformed.  The video follows this immigrating vegetable North as it eventually becomes the potato chip, the couch potato, and the ‘French Fry.è  While following the potato's journey and transformation, Papapapá simultaneously follows another Peruvian in motion, Augusto Rivera.  My dad, Augusto Rivera was raised in Lima, Peru, but moved to the United States forty years ago.  The stories of these two disparate immigrants, the potato, and my pop, converge as Augusto Rivera becomes a Peruvian couch potato, sitting on the American sofa, eating potato chips and watching Spanish Language television.Papapapá is a humorous look at race and immigration, television and nostalgia, distance and the many ways people deal with it.  Papapapá examines how bodies (people and vegetable) are remade within the new societies they encounter.",
