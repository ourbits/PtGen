    "introduction": "Based upon real testimonies, this hybrid film tells the story of Tania, a teenage girl forced into prostitution in the gold mining regions of Peru. Tania remembers how she was taken from her home lured with false promises of wealth and riches and how she slowly lost her identity in the process, changing her life forever. While sharing her story with a police officer, Tania's voice takes us from one memory to another. While she talks, the camera takes us on her a journey from the jungle to the mining region, from Tania's home where her grandmother died to the heart of her exploitation in the prostitution bars. The Amazon's beautiful scenery, the floating slums and the jungle are in sharp contrast with the darkness of the story, the poverty and the poignant testimony of a young girl. And though she is now safe, where her youthlike sense of worthiness and innocence once shined, a deeper and darker selfnowledge has settled in. The feverish rush for gold combined with the destruction of the environment echoes as an allegory for the destruction of life in a capitalist world.",
