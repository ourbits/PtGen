    "introduction": "The six-episode, one-hour series challenges 11 lucky participants, chosen from thousands of hopefuls from across the country, to create their very own superhero alter ego, live with each other in a secret lair and compete against each other to prove their mettle, reveal the true nature of their superhuman abilities and invoke the noble credos by which they live. There's only one person in the world who is qualified to act as both judge and jury for such a contest and that's Stan \"The Man\" Lee, the creator of Spider-Man, The Hulk, Fantastic Four and X-Men, to name only a few. During the six-week competition, these homegrown superheroes will live under Stan's watchful eye doing their utmost to demonstrate the true qualities of a superhero - courage, integrity, self-sacrifice, compassion and resourcefulness - while at the same time fighting tooth and nail to come out on top by the seat of their spandex pants. The winner flies away with the greatest prize in reality TV history! His or her superhero character will be immortalized in a new comic book to be created by Stan Lee himself and released by Dark Horse Comics! The winner will also be featured in one of SCI FI Channel's wildly popular original Saturday night action movies and receive a trip for two to Florida to be a featured guest in Universal Orlando Resort's daily superhero parade.
