Moving away from the city and her best buddy Ashley, Kristen and her father arrive at Grandma Pearl's country ranch. Now Kristen has to adjust to a new life on the ranch, to new friends and a totally different style of fashion. With the help of her new BFF - a talking horse named Stanford, she's finally fitting in. Stanford, being a beauty himself, helps Kristen out as they become inseparable. But, sometimes even best friends can be a little bit jealous of other friends, too.",
