With his strict rules and harsh actions, Vahid instills fear in everyone, and his power starts to cause turmoil beyond the sect. However, Levent, who has begun using his pen to fight against reactionary forces, has no intention of giving up. But to rescue Meryem, who has threatened Vahid with Zeynep, from his threats, they need crucial evidence, which requires everyone, especially Sadi, to unite their efforts. Meanwhile, Cüneyd, who everyone depends on, has disappeared while on the verge of losing his grip on reality. Before all hope is lost, Cüneyd must pull himself together and fight for Zeynep. However, this time his biggest enemy isn't outside, but inside his mind. As Zeynep faces her ill-fated destiny, Levent's attempts at victory will be tested by a disaster rapidly approaching Beste and Meryem.",
