    "introduction": "“I met Mohamad A. in 2000. I spent months listening to him telling me how he fought and killed. Through him, I wanted to know if I too would have killed in that war. As he talked, I let my moral guard down. I no longer had any critical sense. I even had empathy for him, a killer” (Danielle Arbid). A conversation between Danielle and Mohamad, resulting in a frankly straightforward ambiance where images keep on writing the film with marked delicateness. A dialogue led by desire, in which Mohamad’s convictions give rise to an unusual complicity between the director and the protagonist.源自：https://doclisboa.org/2023/en/filmes/a-killer/",
