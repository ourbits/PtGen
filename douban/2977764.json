    "introduction": "This documentary presents the rise and fall of the MIT blackjack team. For two years in the early '90s, the team reportedly earned millions from casinos around the world with their skills, until conflict within the group and a diligent security company brought the group's winnings to a crashing halt. Included are interviews with team members and author Ben Mezrich, whose 2003 book Bringing Down the House focuses on a later M.I.T. team.  Includes interesting dramatic recreations of the teams efforts and exploits.  Encoded for worldwide viewing. * Editor note: However, don't hold me on the historical accuracy -- but it is a great video!  This video should not be confused with the upcoming Kevin Spacey movie of the same name and subject matter.",
