    "introduction": "Activists find their plan to vandalise a store goes south after getting trapped inside with a security guard who has a gruesome passion for hunting in this fresh take on the slasher genre.From RKSS, the directorial collective behind Turbo Kid, Summer of 84 and We Are Zombies, comes a fresh take on the slasher genre where classic adrenaline-fueled horror and Gen Z environmental issues collide in one twisted night from hell. A group of young activists set out to make a political statement by vandalising a home superstore as it closes. But their plan goes terribly wrong when they become trapped inside and must face a deranged security guard with a gruesome passion for primitive hunting (Turlough Convery). As the night fills with violence and terror, a desperate fight for their lives begins.源自：https://www.glasgowfilm.org/movie/wake-up?date=2024-03-08#/movie/wake-up",
