    "introduction": "A story tells about five students and their professor from Kyiv archaelogical Institute. They are going to the trip to nearby forest. There they find a pit closed with rusty grid... The film is quite funny, but trying to look scary, increasing the suspense. But the suspense is weak, because the things happening on the screen aren't frightening enough. Most actors are playing there roles realistically. But... The ending is really stupid. All mystical ambiance, mystic stuff molded through the film are vanished by the ending. It is really bad. The film is not very good, but as the first experience of Ukrainian horror film-making it is quite good.",
