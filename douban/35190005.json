Some of them have bigger plans, they want to move to the ocean and buy new properties. Some are stressed. What can babies eat? Cucumber? Is it ok with salmon? One father, Jon, is working as a teacher. The principal at his school call parents to keep their children home so they won't drag down the scores on the National test. The grown-ups are under pressure. They fill out forms on anxiety symptoms and divorce-papers. Sinking down in therapy-chairs and lying in each other's couches. The fragile nuclear-family structures are cracking down and other grown-ups step up to help. The babies are there, present in every picture, witnessing.",
