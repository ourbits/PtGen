    "introduction": "On January 15, 2004, the Bugaled Breizh sank suddenly off the coast of England, killing the five French sailors on board. That day, NATO exercises were being prepared in this maritime zone... The sinking, as sudden as it was unexplained, caused a shock wave within the victims' families. Faced with a judicial mechanism that escapes them and the feeling that the institutions are keeping quiet about the reasons for the sinking, Marie, the sister-in-law of one of the victims, will become their spokesperson and engage the community of sailors in a long quest for the truth. Her meeting with the families' lawyer will lead her into the murky waters of the investigation where the recurring shadow of a submarine hovers and will change her life forever.Loosely inspired by the Bugaled Breizh affair.",
