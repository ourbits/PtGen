    "introduction": "Two men in a black van in the midst of a night-long journey. The driver is a taciturn young man with his right hand bandaged up and his talkative companion, an old laborer. With their inner fears and emotional wounds they draw each other closer while pushing each other away, mimicking a typical father-son relationship. Along with a heavy emotional burden, they carry no less heavy of a physical load in the trunk of the van. Both are eager to get rid of the burdens of the past and heal their wounds. But for what price?",
