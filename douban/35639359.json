The American musician Topper Carew is credited with \"conception\", as well as soundtrack.The Maggot was a collaboration between TVC and The Righteous Apple, which appears to be Carew's brand: eight years later he produced a live action TV series called The Righteous Apples, about a fictional teenage pop group.",
