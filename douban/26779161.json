    "introduction": "The hope was that network technology would bring us together, create a 'global village', make our political desires more coherent. But what's happened is that our desires have become distributed, exploded into images and over screens our eyes relentlessly drop to view. REVOLUTION OF THE PRESENT examines the strange effects - on cities, economies, people - of what we might call accelerated capitalism. Set against a visually striking array of sounds and images, fifteen international thinkers speak to the complexity and oddity of this contemporary moment as they discuss what is and what can be.",
