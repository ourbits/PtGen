    "introduction": "Fifty years after the death of Winston Churchill, this drama-documentary draws on private letters, diaries and the testimony of his personal physician to reveal how he turned his own failings into victory during his first three months as prime minister in 1940. This was a period when France was collapsing, the Nazis had the Allies on the run, the British Army was being defeated at Dunkirk, and Britain faced invasion by Hitler's troops. The story is brought to life by Robert Hardy as Churchill, Jemma Redgrave as his wife Clementine, Phil Davis as physician Charles McMoran Wilson, and Edwin Thomas as civil servant John Colville.",
