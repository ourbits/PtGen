    "introduction": "Cheap-jack psychological drama from New Zealand will test the patience of most film viewers. The script - surrounding a young woman\\'s interaction with a jailed child killer in the form of taped interviews - is woefully amateurish and delivered with all the conviction of a high school acting class. The feeble attempt at social insight into the psyche of a killer and the impact on family victims is eroded away by poor acting, limp pacing and stunningly uncreative and inept direction. An excruciating bore that explodes in the final scenes with an utterly predictable burst of violence. Credit goes the composer of the gloomy soundtrack who offers the only inkling of talent here",
