    "introduction": "Their names were Herta, Liesel, Liselotte and Hildegard: Hundreds of thousands of women, including secretaries, nurses, housewives and concentration camp guards, put themselves in the service of Nazi ideology in the German-occupied areas from 1939 onwards. The women were not passive witnesses to a genocide committed by men, but active accomplices and murderers. In the history of the Second World War, the role of women was often only marginally recognized. Around 500,000 of them were active in the areas occupied by the Wehrmacht from 1939 - where the Holocaust was actually implemented. —ARTE",
