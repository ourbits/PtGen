The action centres on the elder two of six siblings living on a Wolverhampton council estate, who fill their days with books, films and teenage whimsy while single matriarch Della struggles to make ends meet. Touted by the Times columnist as featuring “smart, amusing intellectuals living on a council estate”, there’s little to qualify that remark here, unless a shot of a character reading Ted Hughes’s Crow counts. If anything, this is barely Malcolm in the Midlands.",
