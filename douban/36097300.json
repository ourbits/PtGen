    "introduction": "Provence, 1847. The son of a wealthy landowner in the south of France, Jean-Baptiste, loses his mother in a tragic accident. His truculent father, who was always envious of his son and his relationship with his mother, takes a harlot he met a few months earlier as his new bride. Soon after, Jean-Baptiste is falsely accused by his \"stepmother\" of trying to take advantage of her. In disgust, his father banishes him forever from the family home. Jean-Baptiste's only solution is to live with Blanche, his mother's sister, in the mountains. He makes a living as a traveling salesman of herbal remedies and plants picked on the slopes of Lure Mountain. When he meets Lila, the daughter of a couple of healers and water diviners, it is love at first sight. She bears him a son, who symbolizes for Jean-Baptiste his victory over adversity. For its part, Lila forges a powerful bond with Blanche and her new family. But Jean-Baptiste's happiness is overrun in the tumult of Provence's rebellion against Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte's coup d'état. Disinherited and cursed by his father, Jean-Baptiste realizes he has only one chance of finding peace: he must reconquer his birthright, the home of his ancestors.——机器翻译：普罗旺斯，1847 年。法国南部一位富有的地主让-巴蒂斯特 (Jean-Baptiste) 的儿子在一场悲惨的事故中失去了母亲。他好斗的父亲总是嫉妒他的儿子和他与母亲的关系，他把几个月前遇到的一个妓女当成了他的新娘。不久之后，让-巴蒂斯特被他的“继母”诬告试图利用她。在厌恶中，他的父亲将他永远驱逐出家。让-巴蒂斯特唯一的解决办法是和他母亲的妹妹布兰奇一起住在山里。他以在诱饵山的山坡上采摘的草药和植物的旅行推销员的身份谋生。当他遇到一对治疗师和占卜师的女儿莉拉时，一见钟情。她为他生了一个儿子，这对让-巴蒂斯特来说象征着他战胜逆境。就其本身而言，莉拉与布兰奇和她的新家庭建立了强大的联系。但让-巴蒂斯特的幸福在普罗旺斯反抗路易-拿破仑·波拿巴政变的骚动中被淹没。让-巴蒂斯特被父亲剥夺了继承权和诅咒，他意识到他只有一次机会找到和平：他必须重新夺回他与生俱来的权利，即他祖先的家园。",
