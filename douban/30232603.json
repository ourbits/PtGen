    "introduction": "NEWFOUNDLAND AT ARMAGEDDON is the story of an epic tragedy. One hundred years ago, on July 1, 1916, the Newfoundland Regiment walked into a blizzard of German machine gun fire near Beaumont-Hamel in France. This two-hour documentary film is about the sacrifices of the men who gave their lives for King and Country, of the women they left behind, and of an island that lost its independence and became Canada’s tenth province. Drawing on diaries, letters and descendants of the men who fought, the film recreates that First World War battle which lasted less than 30 minutes and its tragic aftermath.",
