    "introduction": "The theme of this film is “our responsibilities and hope for the future”. IMPROVEMENT CYCLE was created by using generative AI technologies including images, videos, music, lyrics, and voices.Several strange images that look like modern Japanese landscapes but are slightly different. And strange music is sung in a mysterious language. These are the memories of the past replayed from the brains of the extinct human race. The aliens are replaying the memories of the human race that have perished, and are silently continuing the work of recording them in various parts of the world. They have a specific aim.",
