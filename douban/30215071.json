The murder of her father marks it, giving her the impetus necessary to fulfill her goal. Her first contact with the world of aviation is to be stewardess, fighting against the multiple obstacles imposed by competing in a totally male environment. John Lucio, a drug lord, is held captive and is in dire need of a ransom, however Zulima, the head of the stewardesses, is unable to make the delivery, and asks Yolanda to do so. Yolanda is thrust into the drug business and John Lucio teaches her how to fly but Dave Mejia is a DEA Agent, whom she initially had feelings for, and puts her in the center of a burning love triangle.",
