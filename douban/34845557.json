She deals with the manager who always seems to have something to say about her physical state; her co-worker, Ted who is obviously interested in her but can't take a hint; and from the catcallers near where she lives. When she finally gets home, there's no one there but her roommate who couldn't care less about her.  All that is about to change when she reaches the gate to her boarding house and finds a peculiar looking gun right on her doorstep. Suddenly, she can do anything she wants, talk back to whoever she wants, and even hurt anyone she wants.",
