    "introduction": "Italy, 1994. The war in the Balkans drags on with no end in sight. Elvis (Moamer Kasumovic), a young man from Sarajevo, is making ends meet by taking pictures of tourists in Venice with his Polaroid camera. Winter closes in, bringing fewer tourists, and Elvis shifts his efforts from Venice to Rome in search of an income. After his camera is stolen, Elvis, not knowing what to do with himself, decides to visit Rodolfo (Marcello Prayer), a stranger met by chance in Venice. Elvis finds Rodolfo living with his parents on a derelict farm in Puglia, in the south of Italy. Their brief and lonely encounter unfolds in the timeless landscape of white washed towns, green hills, olive trees and shifting clouds.",
