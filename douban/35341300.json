    "introduction": "The verdict over 30 years of our democracy. Were they a success or a failure? Robert Sedláček's unique television project combines actors with real experts and members of the public in the roles of witnesses and a jury ... 30 years of democracy in the Czech Republic The starting point for this court is the program statement of the Civic Forum. \"What we want\" from November 89, the non-fulfillment of which is the subject of a lawsuit and court proceedings. A show on the thirtieth anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, which will not deal with the events of thirty years ago, but where we went in the years since the revolution as a society and how we fulfilled what we dreamed at the end of 89 that once as Czechs, as society, we want and we can be.(Czech television)",
