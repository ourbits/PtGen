    "introduction": "A hook but no fish follows Spong’s research into the language invented by 12th-century mystic Hildegard von Bingen during her 39 years at Disibodenberg monastery in western Germany. Received by Hildegard through divine inspiration, the Lingua Ignota is said to have been used in secret, to increase solidarity amongst her fellow sisters. The film was partially shot at the site of the monastery where an 8-year-old Hildegard was interned with other women.",
