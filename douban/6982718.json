    "introduction": "In 1969, a Japanese detective film Black Lizard was released. It went on to become a cult classic. The main character \"Black Lizard\" was played by Akihiro Miwa, who has been a Japanese icon for the last 50 years. Since his rise to fame in the 1960s, singer and actor Miwa Akihiro has been an inspiration to writers, artists, musicians, film and theater makers. For years being the sole public figure in Japan to openly declare his homosexuality, Miwa has also encouraged openness and a feeling of identity among young Japanese homosexuals. Directed by French director Pascal-Alex Vincent, Miwa: A Japanese Icon is the first authorized documentary about the wonderful and iconic Japanese artist.",
