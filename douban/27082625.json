As the night goes on, four gruesome stories are shared... the story of Mike and Kathy, a young couple who has come to ease their ailing aunt's transition to better living... or so they say... the tale of Jake and Amy, who get more than they bargained for on a romantic getaway turned nightmare... the story of a vengeful spider, on a mission of terror... and the tale of siblings, Sam and Emily, who have developed an insatiable appetite for human flesh. As the night grows darker, and the tales grow stranger, the friends begin to realize that some stories should be left untold.",
