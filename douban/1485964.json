    "introduction": "This little film of revised found feature film shots doesn’t need more than sixty seconds to prove that cinema is a first class medium for both the idle and the busy. An artfully composed idyll by the sea, uneventful, just like an image from a dream, is sped up and transformed into a nightly ghost ride, driving against traffic down a busy street, through flickering black and white oscillations, toward the glaring headlights of a car – or that of a film projector.源自：https://www.filmfestival.gr/en/section-tiff/movie/1241/14621",
