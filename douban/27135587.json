    "introduction": "It will pass. We're recovering. Jean celebrates his birthday, drinks too much and remembers the disastrous weekend that led to his break with Mathilde.Give it time. You’ll get over it. Jean celebrates his birthday, gets drunk and recalls the dreadful weekend that led to his break-up with Mathilde.DIRECTOR’S STATEMENTGros Chagrin is a short movie shot on animation table, Alexeieff-Parker pin-screen and 16mm film. My project was to come as close as I could to the stream of consciousness of someone reflecting on a recent breakup. How Jean deals with guilt, pain and in the end blind anxiety, was the most important part of the story, thus voluntarily deconstructed with a mix of techniques, hectic editing and bursts of humour.",
