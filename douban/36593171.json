    "introduction": "Gabriel is a former boxer who lives in a village removed from the city with his father and his dog, Pepe. Everyone knows him by the nickname of Tarado, which he earned in his days as a boxer and, although he could still box, he prefers to lead a quiet life away from everything that led him to spend a few years in prison. For this, he has made several decisions such as leaving his longtime girlfriend, La Mónica, who was a bad influence to start from scratch. But old ghosts always come back, and Tarado will have to deal with the situation the way he knows best: fight.",
