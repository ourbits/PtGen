Carl, Jon and Andy have been mates forever.They are Generation X - hardened party animals but their party train is grinding to a halt. Andy is getting married. They never thought it would come to this.They have spent 10 years running away from responsibility but now they've reached 30 it has suddenly hit them between the eyes.Reluctantly they take a long, hard look at their lives and find themselves straying into the \"dark side\" - opening up to their feelings, emotions and to other people.Suddenly the previously taboo words, love, relationship and responsibility can make them happy. Bit by bit the balance of their friendship shifts and together the boys struggle with the aftershock of their life-changing decisions.",
