    "introduction": "The West takes a critical stance towards Russia. Vladimir Putin's image of the West is a reflection of this. Being the most well-known Russian politician, he is at the same time also a favoured target of Western criticism. He has been a central figure after the fall of the Soviet Union, however, his publicity enables us to sophisticatedly depict Russia and its development during the last 15 years through him.Who is Vladimir Putin? Does he see Russia as a part of Europe? We take a look at Putin's youth in the former Soviet Union. And we will learn about his time in the former German Democratic Republic. How did he experience the end of the Soviet Union? How did he come to Moscow during the time under Yeltsin?Our film will offer to the viewer a personal perspective of the rise of Vladimir Putin and Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union. The multiple award-winning television author Hubert Seipel accompanied Vladimir Putin in Russia over a period of many weeks. He not only conducted several interviews with him but was also present when Putin shouldered judo opponents or challenged his bodyguards during a game of ice hockey.",
