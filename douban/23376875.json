    "introduction": "This film about Ahmad Donish (1827-1897), poet, artist, mathematician, astronomer, educator, and philosopher, who lived in the second half of the 19th century in Bukhara. He is the first Tajik who sought to reform in Bukhara through education. He was nominated as secretary for a delegation to St. Petersburg, and during his time made three trips to Russia, which expended his knowledge and world view. Based on those trips, he considered both the traditional Islamic and the new European models and advanced the democratic ideas between the Bukhara Emirate and Russia. He was the first who stressed the need for modern knowledge in contemporary life, as well as the need for political and education reforms in Bukhara. The film reflects the time during ruled Emir Muzaffar (1860-1885), where Ahmad Donish was appointed as the delegation's consultant (1869-1870) in St. Petersburg to reestablish ties between Emir and Russia. To accomplish those historical events of traveling Ahmad Donish from Bukhara to St. Petersburg, Russia, the film was made by two USSR film studios working in collaboration with each other, Tajikfilm (based in Dushanbe, Tajikistan) and Lenfilm (based in St. Petersburg, Russia).",
