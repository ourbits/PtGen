The grandson is dissatisfied, thinks that he will be bored here. But not this time. It turns out that the old man has a chicken nest on the roof of the booth, in which eggs lie every morning. It's unclear where it came from, and where the chicken itself is. After a while, a stranger falls on their head and just as mysteriously disappears. A series of amazing meetings and events will make this summer unforgettable.",
