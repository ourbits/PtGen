    "introduction": "With spectacular footage and insider interviews, Frontline reconstructs the events leading up to the war, the war itself, and its aftermath. You'll hear first-hand accounts from key decision-makers like Generals Schwarzkopf and Powell and world leaders like Margaret Thatcher and Mikhail Gorbachev. Desert Storm was a triumph of technology with real-time views of spectacular light shows as antiaircraft fire lit up Baghdad's nighttime sky. After six grueling weeks, the US declared victory, just short of forcing Hussein to step down. Today Hussein remains in power, albeit under close surveillance by American troops remaining in the region. Was it a victory or was it a war with an inconclusive end.",
