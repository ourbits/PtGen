    "introduction": "Once upon a time, there were old man and old woman. In the distant past, they lived in a house with their two children. However, after the kids matured, they certainly moved from the village to the city. Thus, the elderly husband and wife were left alone in their home. One of the usual days children and grandchildren unexpectedly come to them. At first sight it seems like a happy event. Written by Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com)",
