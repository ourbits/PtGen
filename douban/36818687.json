    "introduction": "An ambitious, unbiased look at a solution to air pollution, energy independence and fossil fuel addiction that is still generally unknown: hydrogen and fuel cells. Could the universe’s most abundant element, hydrogen, address the possibility of a sustainable, clean energy future where power for vehicles, homes, factories or cities can be generated and stored on a vast scale, even as the renewable community’s narrative continues to revolve around batteries, in spite of their limitations?First-time filmmaker John Michael Parkan follows the odyssey of a hydrogen fuel cell future, from the early days of the Clinton administration to the money, power and politics that have shielded public knowledge and sentiment from the promise of civilization attaining its lofty renewable energy goals which can sustain us through this century and beyond. The film leaves the audience with a simple question:Why aren’t we doing this?",
