    "introduction": "A teenager who is struggling with the usual trials of adolescence also has to deal with his homosexuality in the dramatic comedy The Story Of A Bad Boy.Pauly (Jeremy Hollingworth) is a 17-year-old Catholic boy who was booted from the parochial school he attended for kissing a nun. While he has an on-and-off girlfriend (Lauren Ward), he seems to have a keener eye for the altar boys at his church and develops a crush on Noel (Christian Camargo), a student teacher at the public high school he now attends. Noel and Pauly soon become an item; between his new love life, classes, the drama club, marching band, his new friends, his increasingly puzzled girlfriend and his baffled parents (Stephen Lang and Julie Kavner), Pauly is wearing himself down to a frazzle, which isn't helped when he decides to go to the big city with a few older gay men he's met for what becomes a three-day party of booze, dancing and decadence.The first feature film directed by playwright Tom Donaghy, The Story Of A Bad Boy was screened as part of the 1999 San Francisco Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide",
