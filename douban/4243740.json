Considers the films THE GRADUATE, LAST TANGO IN PARIS, SONS AND LOVERS, DON'T LOOK NOW, DEEP THROAT, EMMANUELLE, the sex comedy CONFESSIONS OF.. films, THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE, NINE-AND-A-HALF WEEKS, BASIC INSTINCT, THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE AND HER LOVER and BOOGIE NIGHTS. Also considers the current demise of sex scenes and X-rated or 18 films as they do not attract targetted young audiences who go more for action films.",
