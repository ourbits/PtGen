    "introduction": "Lynley is visiting the family estate with his sister. Lynley is concerned that his mother may not be able to run the place on her own. As he debates whether to continue his police career or return to Cornwall permanently, he studiously avoids having to tell his mother that he and Helen are separated after the loss of the baby. Havers is also in the area on leave and attending a rehab center. They're soon drawn in by the local police to assist with the suspicious death of Stephen Fenner who is found hanging in his barn. The post-mortem reveals that he was drugged and the suspicious death is soon a murder investigation. Fenner had recently been on the wrong end of a business deal having bought a lame racehorse. The investigation reveals however that there is a smuggling ring operating along the Cornish coast and Fenner may have been involved. A key suspect and a police officer will die however before Lynley and Havers identify the ringleader.",
