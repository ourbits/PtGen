    "introduction": "Although he owns a small business, Achilles cannot face working any more than he can muster the energy to deal with the world he used to be a part of. Then one day, an unexpected visitor named Homer shows up at Achilles' doorstep, bearing an unusual gift: an old dilapidated camping trailer painted like a child's image of a watermelon. Insisting that delivering this improbable gift to Achilles is his \"mission\", sworn to at knife-point for the young man's hated stepfather Creon, Homer forces Achilles to accept the bizarre object. As fate would have it, the Watermelon acts as a magnet, luring all manner of oddball humanity to Achilles' home - a flaky artist, a pushy photo-journalist, a pedantic television reporter, and even the ghost of his beloved mother. At first, Achilles rejects the intrusions, until one day he discovers a young runaway sleeping in the trailer. Rather than chase her off as he did the others, Achilles invites the vulnerable Persephone into his home... and his life. Eleventh-hour appearances from his ex-wife and deranged step-sister ensure that Achilles' life will never be the same. Until it is. Sort of.",
