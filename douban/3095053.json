    "introduction": "The film is based on the book Frankenstein's Aunt but there are many changes. Similar to the book aunt Hannah comes to Frankenstein but at first rather with the aim to find a bride for her nephew so that little Frankensteins comes in the family. But he is too busy for something like that. He tries to create a man with the power of a machine and the brain of a genius. Aunt Hannah meets here diffent to the novel more spooks like a merman, a fire spirit and a White Lady and the orphan Max, who is running away from a circus.http://www.jakubiskofilm.com/en/index.php?sites=filmy&jaky=max&sekce=galerieCountess von Frankenstein is coming to mend the destruction caused by her nephew, who tried to create an artificial human being. Not only is the castle in ruins, but there are also many spooks there -a merman, a white lady ghost, a cursed servant, a fiery man, an unhappy werewolf (who likes people),and noble count Dracula. She also finds a poor hidden orphan, freckled Max, who ran away from a group of comedians. His honesty, spontaneous behavior and inventiveness bring all the castle inhabitants together and solve the emotional problems that have been going on for a year. All the spooks, influenced by love, become human beings at the end.J. Jakubisko: \"This seven country co-production was a challenge for me. The producers' wish was to see spooks from every single culture so it would be familiar for children around the world. So we found ourselves in Babylon during the production - many languages, many spooks\"1 hour 36 min / colorFilm was edited from a 13 -episode TV series.Premiere screening: September 1987Produced by: Slovenská filmová tvorba, Czechoslovak TV, Czechoslovakia / Taurus Film Munich, West GermanyBased on the novel Frankenstein 's Aunt by A.R.PetterssonScreenplay by: Jaroslav Dietl, Juraj Jakubisko, Joachim Hammann, Jozef Pastéka Director of Photography: Jan Duris2nd camera: Juraj Jakubisko, Jan PirohMusic by: Guido and Maurizio De AngelisDirected by: Juraj Jakubisko",
