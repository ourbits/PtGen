His girlfriend having recently died in a tragic water-skiing mishap, Steve Hillman (Danny Sachen) heads for Moravia to clear his head and soak in the sights. Once there, Steve discovers that the dreaded Count Dracula (Ernest Garcia) has turned Moravia into his own personal vampire buffet. And the villagers are powerless to stop him, until famed vampire hunter Dr. Van Helsing (Bruce Glover) shows up on the scene. Now, if Steve and Van Helsing can just get the upper hand on their two-fanged tormentor, the residents of Moravia will be able to sleep easy for the first time in a very long while.",
