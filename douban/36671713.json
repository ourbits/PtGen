    "introduction": "The story of a woman who has to choose between two men. Shot in black and white and in the classic silent film format. There is no camera movement, neither a pan nor a drive and certainly no zoom. Everything is of extreme simplicity: the title, the opening credits, the music (a flute sonata by Bach), the story being told.\"At the beginning of the movie, the woman smells the man's shirt; he had just left her in the morning, in her apartment. At the end, another image, one in a showcase at the Schiller Theater in Berlin. Vogler in costume. (...) Then the touching encounter between two lovers. The nervousness, the insecure jumpiness, shyness and yet expectation.\" (Rolf Aurich, in: Filmwärts No 19, Summer 1991)The woman \"makes a decision for an independent life, and when you see her, years later, as one of two images superimposed in the reflection of a pane, you are happy. Happy with her about her and about the strength of women, which Thome has recognized so well and which he presents to the viewer so unpretentiously, so naturally, so clearly in his short films.\" (Doris Kuhn: Die Stärke der Frauen, in: Formen der Liebe. Die Filme von Rudolf Thome, Marburg 2010)",
