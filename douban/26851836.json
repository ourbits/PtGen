On her initiative, the family has been planning to borrow her brother's old travel caravan, pack their trunks and head out to a summer holiday in the south. But the plans take a different turn when Karina's suspicion about her dentist partner's affair turns out to be real. This starts her on an adventurous journey that is witty, utterly humane, full of blunders and chances to start again, with colourful characters whose only aim is to find happiness.",
