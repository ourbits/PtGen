    "introduction": "The dramatic, phantasmic etchings, paintings, and installations of Ilya and Emilia Kabakov have made them among the most acclaimed artists of the last century. Their work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Guggenheim, the Centre Pompidou, The Hermitage, The Tretyakov Gallery, the Norwegian Museum of Contemporary Art, and far beyond. This film, directed by acclaimed filmmakers Kerstin Stutterheim and Niels Bolbrinker, and made with the Kabakovs themselves, provides a rare and up-close perspective on their work.",
