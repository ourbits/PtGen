    "introduction": "Just eight days after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake, an NHK program began recording the messages of survivors. The program continues to this day, offering people a place to express their hopes and fears. We follow up with the survivors we've met over the years, and hear from people who were directly involved with the government's reconstruction policies. We examine what \"reconstruction\" means now, 12 years after the disaster.",
