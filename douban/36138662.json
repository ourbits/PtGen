    "introduction": "This is, as is announced from the very beginning, a film made of letters. Letters written in secret, letters hidden inside drawers, letters that fly from hand to hand. It all begins with a neighbor in love, but that is only what triggers the circulation of desire—the letters are passed from one character to the other and weave an unpredictable plot of comings and goings. Love Will Come as a Forestal Fire has the delicacy of a world made of paper, of handwritten messages, of stamps and envelopes—a world in which words become palpable for the tangibility it acquires as well as the textures of the voices that embody them. And it also has the astuteness of knowing that, in cinema, one writes not only through language, but also through lights and shadows, with the gasp from the breeze that caresses the leaves in the trees源自：https://www.mardelplatafilmfest.com/37/en/pelicula/el-amor-vendra-como-un-incendio-forestal",
