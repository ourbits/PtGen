In his work he has found the perfect excuse to isolate himself from a world that does not appeal to him anymore. Nevertheless, the unusual appearance of a dog that likes to chase fireflies in the dark, and the unexpected arrival of Valeria, a thirteen years old daughter whose existence he ignore, will allow this solitary man an opportunity to recover the joy of being alive.",
