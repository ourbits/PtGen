    "introduction": "The Masked Strangler is one of the most disturbing, shocking, and controversial movies you will ever see, because it is based on true documented cases involving homosexual serial killers.THE MASKED STRANGLER was one of the first male victim movies ever made. It is disturbing story about a high school boy who thinks he lives next door to a psychopath obsessed with strangling teenage boys. This original story was a collaboration between producerTodd Russell and Factory 2000, a prolific group of young film makers known for their underground stories of teenage kidnapping, sex and murder most notably the \"Infamous Bondage Murders\", \"I was a Teenage Strangler\", and the social satire that led to an FBI investigation and subsequent arrest of the film makers(*William Hellfire), DUCK! THE CARBINE HIGH MASSACRE….. After the police ignore his concerns, he conducts his own investigation which draws him deep and irreversibly into the sick and perverted world of a lonely psychopath.",
