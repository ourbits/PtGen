    "introduction": "This series follows the construction on Hinkley Point C, Britain’s new nuclear power station being built in a remote corner of Somerset. Costing over £22 billion and covering an area the size of 250 football pitches, this site is one of the largest in Europe and the UK’s first new nuclear power station for a generation.Cameras follow the engineers, technicians and the behind the scenes staff who are under pressure to keep the project on track, including building the mammoth foundations for the two nuclear reactors, excavate 3.5km cooling water tunnels out under the Bristol Channel, and construct the critical airtight inner steel lining designed to contain any radioactive material in the unlikely event of a meltdown.",
