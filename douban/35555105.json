    "introduction": "France, November 2015. After the Paris terror attacks, the state of emergency is proclaimed to facilitate the work of police forces. 4 AM. A policewoman helps colleagues to conduct a search, but soon finds out that things aren’t going the way they’re supposed to.DIRECTOR’S STATEMENTI believe it is important that films make people look at what we don’t want to face as a society. I wanted to make a movie whose political impact stems directly from the staging, in order to denounce the violence of the permanent state of emergency we live in. A single long take to trap the audience in the sensory and ethical turmoil of a police search.",
