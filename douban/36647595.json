    "introduction": "Europe in the 1920s and 1930s – a continent licks its wounds after the devastation of World War I. In this fertile breeding ground for dissent, authoritarian regimes are on the rise.The Abyss: Rise and Fall of the Nazis takes a fresh look at the Third Reich from a global and current perspective. It tells us how the Nazis first conquered Germany and then half of Europe within a few years. How could that be, with the horrors of World War I still so fresh? Why did it take so long before they were stopped? A combination of previously unpublished archive material, historical sources, and an international team of experts paint a new picture of Hitler’s regime.The series unpacks the complex sequence of events that enabled the new regime, and allowed violence and brutality to unfold on an unbelievable scale. A look at history with direct relevance to the world today.Episode 1 | The Seeds of Violence 1918-1922Episode 2 | Deceit and Delusion 1923-1928Episode 3 | Democracy without Democrats 1929-1933Episode 4 | The Racial State 1933-1934Episode 5 | Hidden in Plain Sight 1935-1938Episode 6 | Up in Flames 1936-1940Episode 7 | The Gates of Hell 1941-1942Episode 8 | Genocide 1942-1944Episode 9 | Armageddon 1943-1945Episode 10 | The Reckoning 1945-1948Production companies: ECO Media GmbH, ZDF Enterprises, ZDFinfo",
