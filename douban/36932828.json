    "introduction": "Extreme Risk Protection Orders, otherwise known as \"red flag\" laws, give state authorities the ability to temporarily seize guns from someone deemed to be an immediate threat to themselves or others. On January 1, 2020, Colorado became the 17th state in the US to pass a 'red flag' law, provoking a number of county sheriffs opposed to the law to declare their counties \"2nd Amendment sanctuaries.\" \"Sanctuary\" follows a handful of Coloradans on multiple sides of this controversial issue as the bill comes into law, including a state legislator and domestic abuse survivor, a member of a local militia, and a Colorado county sheriff. As these individuals address the threats, real and imagined, that the law responds to or poses, \"Sanctuary\" offers a timely meditation on the meaning of safety in America today.",
