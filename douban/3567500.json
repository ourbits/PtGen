    "introduction": "Richard Franklin is a real maverick associated with Australian film sector. This, his very first feature, has the two main axes of this 1970s movie revival - nostalgia (Picnic At suspending Rock et. al. ) and intercourse (Alvin Purple et. al.) but failed to capitalize in the appeal of either probably because of the director’s un-Australian penchant for Hollywood cinema (in addition to the fact that it wasn’t extremely great, but then neither was Alvin Purple). A sort of reduced rent Cat Ballou (it was created on budget of $AU240,000) based on the popular bawdy “pome” alluded to within the name, it was scripted by Franklin along with Alan Hopgood whom skilled in the aforementioned sexual axis, giving us not just the Alvin Purple films but additionally Pacific Banana. It is now mainly of interest as a curio with to-be governmental satirist Max Gillies engaging as Dead Eye Dick, a short look by thespianally-challenged Graham Bond (ABCTV’s Aunty Jack) and a similarly unimpressive full-frontal nude appearance by 70s queen of TV sex, Abigail. As a Western spoof it's not especially funny and whilst the relationship between the intimately impotent Dead Eye and pantsman extraordinaire, Mexican Pete (played by Serge Lazareff, another popular face on the little display screen throughout the 70s) is on a regular basis mentioned as a holding discuss the co-dependent psychology of Australian mateship it doesn't result in the movie as such any even more watchable.",
