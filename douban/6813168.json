    "introduction": "In September 1923 a \"red\" uprising in Bulgaria is crushed and drowned in blood. A year and a half later a bomb planted by left-wing terrorists explodes in the St Nedelya Church in Sofia where the cream of society has gathered. One hundred and fifty people are killed and three hundred sustain serious injuries. The Tsar and some government ministries escape because their arrival in church is delayed. In an atmosphere of unbridled \"white\" terror a large number of left thinking people get blacklisted by the police. The failure of the attempt on the life of Tsar provides a pretext for further atrocities. The passing of the iniquitous State Defense Act is a prelude to latter-day St Bartholomew's Day Massacre, unprecedented in twentieth-century Europe. The extremely complex political situation caused certain ultra-left forces to resort to individual terrorism. While examining the reasons for this erroneous decision, the filmmakers denounce the social system and policies, which led to terror. The facts forming the basis of the story afford a number of parallels with certain contemporary events in the world. Written by Georgi Djulgerov <major1@mbox.contact.bg>",
