    "introduction": "In a kingdom bound by hierarchy and surrounded by magical wilderness, young maiden Jasna stands against the tyrannical ruler, Volk. In his wrath, he banishes her on a treacherous journey to a land from which none return. Guided by courage, she finds an ally in Eagle, the forest guardian. Together, they seek to break the kingdom’s chains. Jasna’s journey reflects ecological and feminist themes, embracing acceptance and understanding. The visually daring form blends live-action with 2D/3D animation and musical sequences inspired by contemporary rap.",
