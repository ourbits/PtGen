To pass the time, they make love, play tennis, go for walks, sleep, at night and sometimes during the day. But the couple is in crisis. Louis feels rejected, while Paul is becoming increasingly distant. Louis takes refuge in his dreams, which shift between desire and repulsion, longing and destruction, hope and paranoia.",
