    "introduction": "Ms. Violante Miranda is a bordello owner who raises a small girl as her own granddaughter. When she gets a little older, she is sent to study in Europe, and when she returns, she becomes a socialite, rejecting her previous milieu and her \"grandmother\".In 1932, in Sao Paulo, when the sick whore Rosita (Célia Coutinho) dies, the warmhearted former prostitute and owner of a bordello Dona Violante Miranda (Dercy Goncalves) raises her daughter Filhinha (Célia Coutinho) as if she were of her own. Violante inclusive marries her mate, Dr. Polidoro (Elísio de Albuquerque), to make Filhinha be accepted in the best schools and raise the girl in silver spoon. Later, she moves to a farm in the country and becomes a successful local citizen and first lady of the place. Near to the wedding day of Filhinha with Gastao, the son of a powerful farmer, his father investigates the past of Violante and calls off the wedding. Violante discloses the secret of Filhinha's origins.A Dramatic Tale of Ingratitude. \"Dona Violante Miranda\" is wrongly classified as a comedy in IMDb. This human tale is actually a drama that exposes the hypocritical morality and costumes of Brazilian society in the 30's, 40's and 50's. Dercy Goncalves is very funny in the role of the warmhearted and simple Dona Violante Miranda, a good woman that won in life in spite of her tough and poor origins. The ingratitude of Filhinha, and the despicable attitude of her grandfather are heartbreaking.",
