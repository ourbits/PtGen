    "introduction": "A young woman is driving alongside a lake. She has an accident and the car plunges into the water. Her body is then possessed by the spirit of an 18th-century witch who was killed by local villagers, and is bent on avenging herself on them.A blood-thirsty Transylvanian witch returns from her grave to destroy the descendants of the townsfolk who executed her. For two hundred years her corpse lies in wait at the bottom of a river. A honeymooning English couple crashes their car into the water triggering the resurrection of the witch who launches into a murderous rampage, viciously attacking her prey with whatever implements are close at hand. As the grief-stricken husband searches for his missing bride, a resident of the town informs him that the witch has used his wife's soul to come back to life and that they must perform an exorcism on the monster if they ever hope to see the young woman again. Armed only with this arcane knowledge, the two follow a trail of bloodshed and carnage to the witch's lair to banish the demonic presence and reunite the couple.A small town in 18th century Transylvania is being terrorized by an evil witch. When a child is brutally attacked, the villagers capture the fiend and sentence her to death by dunking chair, but not before she casts a curse on them and their descendants. Two hundred years later, young newlyweds Veronica (Barbara Steele, Black Sunday) and Philip (Ian Ogilvy, And Now The Screaming Starts) pass through the town on a tour of the Carpathians, only to have their car pulled into a lake by an unseen force . A passing truck driver quickly rescues two bodies from the wreck. One is Philip, battered but alive, and the other is...the witch, back from the dead to wreak havoc on the town once again! Can Philip and his newfound friend, the great grandson of Professor Van Helsing, capture the witch and bring back Veronica?",
