    "introduction": "\"Director Andrei Blaier spent most of his life and career during the Communist period, and when the regime changed after 1990 used the regained freedom to make a couple of films about the legends of the Romanian underworld in the 20th century. While 'Crucea de Piatra' focused on the end of the brothels district in Bucharest, 'Terente' happens early in the 20th century in Eastern Romania, where a famous outlaw lived kind of a Clyde with many Bonnies legend in the landscape of the Danube Delta which also belongs to the famous Romanian-French writer Panait Istrati.Unfortunately the film is far from the legend. Although blessed with the presence of a couple of the best Romanian actors of the time (Ilarion Ciobanu and Gheorghe Dinica) the film suffers because of poor technical means (although only 13 years old the copy looks like 63 years old) but first of all due to superficial cinema and schematic dealing with the characters. Despite of the provoking subject the film belongs much more to the old and bad Romanian cinema than to the new one.\"",
