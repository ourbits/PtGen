    "introduction": "The story tells about former football hooligan Ray Knight , a security guard at a financial trading company in Canary Wharf (the symbol of corporate wealth which looms high over the impoverished communities below).Newfound social responsibilities are trampled underfoot when Ray's racist past is revived amid tensions between Whites and Asians jostling for position on the council housing list. Among those who are wanting to be rehoused in a new development is Ray's alcoholic ex-wife Sadie, and his teenage daughter Nikki.The film was made to explore far-right and racism issues that affect people of all ages today.It was written by Frank Deasy, produced by Ruth Caleb and directed by Tony Smith.",
