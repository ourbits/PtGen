    "introduction": "Based on the book Deep Beyond the Reef by Owen Scott, veteran Kiwi director Annie Goldson tells a fascinating and tragic story that spans four generations of a white Fijian family, the Scotts, considered amongst the colonial island's most prominent and colourful inhabitants. Fiji's lavish homes, private clubs and manicured gardens were the idyllic playgrounds for the island's elite for generations. But after significant political unrest and a series of military coups disrupts the island's tranquility, the author's brother John Scott and his lover Greg Scrivener are murdered in a brutal hate crime of horrific violence. In the wake of the tragedy, Goldson and Scott travel back to the island in search of the truth about the murders, revealing layers of history and family intrigue that unfolded amidst the end of colonial rule and the fight for Fijian independence.-Chris McDonald",
