    "introduction": "The plot of the movie revolves around a U.S. Marshal, on a snowy Christmas Eve, who seeks refuge from her judgmental family by immersing herself in work. However, her plans take an unexpected turn when she gets snowed in with an unlikely companion – a cheerful and heavily pregnant fugitive. To complicate matters, she finds herself tasked with keeping this soon-to-be mom safe from both labor pains and a merry band of bumbling goons led by a trio of hitmen who couldn’t find a reindeer in the North Pole.",
