    "introduction": "In 1998 Mario Rocha, a young Latino, was convicted of murder on the basis of one questionable identification and not a shred of physical evidence. He was 16 years old at the time of his arrest, yet tried as an adult and sentenced to life in prison. While spending over two years in juvenile hall waiting for his trial, Mario joined a writing program and discovered his talent and love for writing. Today his stories, plays and poems are published and performed in prisons throughout the country. This film interweaves Mario's story as an inmate in one of California's toughest maximum-security prisons with the efforts of an unlikely group of people who have come together to win his freedom.",
