    "introduction": "High school loner, Darby Reynolds, has always been an outcast. She spends her days at L'Excite All-Girls Boarding School, high above the bleachers, watching the beautiful, scantily clad cheerleaders as they practice their routines. When Veronica Martin, Darby's current infatuation, breaks up with her cheating boyfriend, Darby befriends the All-American cheerleader. The friendship quickly blossoms into obsession, and the obsession quickly transpires into something sexual. No sooner do the two share an intimate night together that Veronica decides to resume her relationship with her boyfriend, leaving Darby confused, angry and alone. Darby quickly moves on to another beautiful female athlete - soccer player, Anna Marks, and the cycle begins all over again. Written by Sarah Howard",
