    "introduction": "圣彼得堡的贵族青年奥涅金，曾经有过和一般贵族青年相似的奢靡生活，但他逐渐开始厌倦上流社会的空虚无聊，抱着对新生活的向往来到乡村。然而，华而不实的贵族教育没有任何帮助，奥涅金四处碰壁，整日苦闷彷徨。在乡下的庄园，他和连斯基及其未婚妻奥尔迦成为好友。奥尔迦的姐姐塔吉扬娜纯朴 、多情，爱上了奥涅金，并勇敢地写信向他倾诉自己纯洁的爱情，但遭到拒绝。经历重重波折之后，二人再次相遇，当年他拒绝她的爱，再遇才知真情谁属，然而一切已物是人非……When Deborah Warner’s production of Eugene Onegin opened the Met season in 2013, soprano Anna Netrebko had only recently begun singing the role of Tatiana; however, when she returned to the part at the Met a few years later, her dramatic approach, like that of the character herself, had grown over time. With a smoldering vocal performance, Netrebko embodies the nuanced aspects of Tatiana’s personality—growing from a girl in the blossom of youth into an elegant, cosmopolitan princess. Opposite her, Peter Mattei sings the title role, a nonplussed aristocrat who discovers the power of love too late, with a rich, supple baritone. As the ardent poet Lenski, bright-voiced tenor Alexey Dolgov offers a heartbreaking portrayal. Elena Maximova is Lenski’s carefree lover Olga, and bass Stefan Kocán delivers a moving performance as the aging Prince Gremin. Maestro Robin Ticciati leads the Met Orchestra and Chorus in a textured reading of Tchaikovsky’s beloved score.Cast & CreativeCONDUCTORRobin TicciatiTATIANAAnna NetrebkoLENSKYAlexey DolgovONEGINPeter MatteiGREMINStefan Kocánhttp://www.metopera.org/season/on-demand/opera/?upc=811357019443",
