    "introduction": "The screenplay, written by Ovcharov, is set in Sofia in the 1890s. The story centres on the power struggle between the Bulgarian prime minister (Zachary Baharov) and a major (Assen Blatechki), who conspires with Russian forces against the PM. The major gets a Romanian woman (Romanian actress Ofelia Popii) involved in this conspiracy, a lady whom both he and the prime minister have been with while living in Bucharest in the past. Soon, the conflict between the two men will spiral into a life-and-death situation.",
