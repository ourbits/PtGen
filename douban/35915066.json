A perfectly still film crew is waiting for the owl to make his move. The crew has been shooting in these woods all week and has spotted a baby eagle and it’s mother. Dimitri seems to sense the eagle’s presence. The trainer calls the owl with a whistle and clicks his clicker. Dimitri is not listening.",
