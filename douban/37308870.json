    "introduction": "THE DARK MONEY GAME films investigate the shadowy world of political donations and fundraising 15 years after the Supreme Court’s decision in the Citizen’s United case, which enabled unlimited spending by hidden sources on many political campaigns.The project is inspired by Jane Mayer’s book “Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right,” and features interviews with journalists including Mayer, as well as lawmakers, judges, FBI investigators, whistleblowers, and insiders on both sides of the issue. Through two separate stories, the films reveal how an untraceable web of money from wealthy individuals and corporations representing business interests or religious agendas flows through non-profits and super PACs (political action committees) to support candidates and political movements.In an environment where 90% of elections are won by the candidate who spends the most money, Gibney examines the legalities and ethics of unchecked financing, following the money to reveal the partisan organizations, corporations, and individuals inside and outside government who benefit from this flow of influence.",
