Being the loving father The Devil is, he tries to stop them before they can accomplish their task.Yet another layer is added when The Devil, through his advocate (voiced by Melissa Bardin Galsky) finds out that the Messiah may indeed be active again in the Earthly realm, this time as a DJ named Jesús.Everything comes together when Lucy, The Anti-Christ, is sent on a date with a politician by her father to the very club DJ Jesús, the Messiah, is spinning at and the two begin to fall for each other.",
