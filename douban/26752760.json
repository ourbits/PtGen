    "introduction": "A visually woven response to Sylvia Plath's own readings of her poetry. These readings plus extracts from an interview given just before her death provide an anchor for a film which celebrates her macabre humour and cinematic vision. A carousel of images in windows, an atmosphere of constant metamorphosis; her poetry as cinema.",
