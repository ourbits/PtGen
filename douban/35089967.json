    "introduction": "1998年，美国酷儿实验电影先驱芭芭拉・汉默在一个没水没电的荒野小屋驻村。在那里一个月的时光，她拍片、录制声音、书写日记。十年后，正在面对死亡的她将这些内容交给了琳恩・萨克斯，并邀请她以此制作一部电影。萨克斯以自己的方式探索汉默这一个月的孤独时光，并透过文字将不同层次的 时空凝结在一起。In 1998, filmmaker Barbara Hammer had an artist residency in a shack without running water or electricity. While there, she shot film, recorded sounds and kept a journal. In 2018, Barbara began her own process of dying. She gave all of her material from the residency to filmmaker Lynne Sachs and invited her to make a film. Through her own filmmaking, Lynne explores Barbara’s experience of solitude. Her text on screen brings us all together in multiple spaces and times.",
