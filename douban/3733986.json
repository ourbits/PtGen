    "introduction": "The Chaouche family is the ideal image of a successful integration: the father is a business leader and among the children there is a world boxing champion (Abdel), a rising star of French politics (Mourad) and a lawyer (Leïla). But while Mourad was appointed Secretary of State and, driven by his ambition, simultaneously attacked the town hall of Bordeaux, his hometown, his brother Abdel lost his title and, injured, decided to return to the ring. The growing rivalry between the two brothers will crystallize around the love of the same woman, Muriel, endanger the family unit and shatter the certainties and illusions of each on the reality of their integration into a France which is not as gentle as they thought.",
