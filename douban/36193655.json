    "introduction": "Loriot, whose real name was Bernhard-Viktor Christoph-Carl von Bülow, or Vicco von Bülow for short (1923-2011), is considered to have been the greatest and most versatile German comedian of the twentieth century. From 1976 to 1978, Radio Bremen commissioned his six-part television series “Loriot”, in which live action skits alternated with short animated sketches. The series is believed to be the highpoint of Loriot’s television work and was to establish his cult status; it has long been an integral part of German cultural heritage. In an interview with Spiegel magazine, Loriot once said: “Everything I find funny stems from crumbling communication and from talking past each other”. Parading this miscommunication before us in scenes that feature married couples, families and bourgeois society, he lays bare the absurdity of our everyday lives determined by rules and norms. Daughters Bettina and Susanne von Bülow and director Peter Geyer are marking the centenary of Loriot’s birth with this presentation of Loriots große Trickfilmrevue, for which 31 of his best-loved animations originally made for television between 1967 and 1993 have been carefully redrawn (and some coloured for the first time) to match Loriot’s style and transferred to a cinema format in 4K.",
