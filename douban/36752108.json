    "introduction": "A reflection by the famous scientist Alexander Von Humbolt on the mystique of an expedition begins a journey of reflections on science through the exploration of the savannas and gallery forests of the Tomo River, which begins in the Meta, crosses the Vichada and ends at the Great Orinoco. This territory is a great biological corridor not only between those departments but also between Colombia and Venezuela, and the point of return for a group of biologists to the area that they had been able to investigate until they had to leave it in the 1980s due to the armed conflict.",
