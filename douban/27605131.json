He intends to take advantage of the festive mood and ask his brother, a gambler and an alcoholic, to change his ways. Braco doesn’t want to listen and won’t take the conversation seriously. Zeko puts his razor under his brother’s neck, forcing him to promise he will change. Braco leaves furious, telling him that he will never see him again, and Švabo suggests that he see a psychiatrist. Alone, without his only friend and brother, Zeko takes a bomb in his hands. He decides to kill himself until Muki , a young man selling books door-to-door, stops him from his intention.",
