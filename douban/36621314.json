    "introduction": "A man remembers a bygone afternoon involving him and his grandfather as they traverse their old neighborhood into other parts of the city in order to pick flowers for school. From the narrow streets of the barangay, they arrive at the nearby business district where high-rise buildings stand and a seemingly out-of-place cemetery lies. It is a cemetery for the rich – with vast greenery and a peaceful atmosphere in contrast to the bustle of the streets outside.源自：https://qcinema.ph/film/tumatawa-umiiyak/",
