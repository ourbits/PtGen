    "introduction": "Little Orphant Annie (2016) is a re-edit of a silent film of the same title from 1918, directed by Colin Campbell, and starring Colleen Moore. Two reels from an original nitrate print were scanned and re-edited to make the new film. The title character warns the other children that if they don't watch out, goblins will get them. The film follows the structure of the poem written by James Whitcomb Riley in 1885. Riley is heard reciting his poem in a recording made in 1912. The poem is also heard read by Kelli Shay Hix in 2016, who additionally wrote and performed the song, \"The Swimmer\".",
