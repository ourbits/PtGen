    "introduction": "In 1999 Stephanie spray began studying music, religion and languages in Nepal, and since then she has spent copious time practicing the art of “wandering” (Dhulna Jāne) with a community of itinerant musicians called the Gandharba. Discontent with the conventions of anthropological and documentary films, in As LONG AS THERE’S BREATH the filmmaker experiments with duration to create a loose narrative revolving around the themes of absence, longing and hope. AS LONG AS THERE’S BREATH is an intimate video work depicting a Nepali family’s struggles for cohesion, despite everyday travails and the absence of a beloved son, and takes its lead from a common Nepali aphorism, “As long as there's breath, there’s hope”, to explore how this existential theme is folded into the fabric of life and punctuates the passage of time.
