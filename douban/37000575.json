    "introduction": "From the creators of TWO WITCHES… a blend of elements from the hellbound genre with that of the slasher one to forge a fresh innovative concept in shock and increase the sensory impact. Employing multiple first-person point-of-view shots to immerse the audience in traumatic childhood experiences, the question is, why is little Mikey terrified of his mother? Maybe it’s because of the evil inside her? Mikey’s night terrors become reality when his mother begins showing signs of demonic possession. What he’s about to experience will haunt him for the rest of his life and claim countless lives across generations.",
