The main scriptwriter is Jonas Frykberg best known for his work on the motion picture The Girl who Played with Fire[4] and will work with Sara Heldt and Alex Haridi.The main character is Johan Gustav Dåådh (Peter Eggers) a former army physician from the Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790), now criminal inspector in Stockholm. He is inspired by the French revolution and the new ideas of his time. He is an atheist, a strong supporter of Republicanism and has embraced Voltaire's freethought philosophy. He has also fallen in love with his superior officer Walhstedt's wife Magdalena. Dåådh and Magdalena both share the same world view and this brings them into a romantic relationship. Dåådh struggles with changing the current world while influencing his revolutionary friends to refrain from violence and an armed struggle.",
