Bo66y is a powerful|dramatic and deeply personal portrait of a genuine footballing icon. Moore fought many battles besides those witnessed by millions on the football field. Behind theglory lies the story of a man who faced highs and lows with the same strength and bravery. But he died young| cruelly shunned by the game and by the very people whoowed him so much. The story is told by his two wives| his friends and fans| including Pele| Sir Geoff Hurst Harry Redknapp| Ray Davies| Ray Winstone and RussellBrand| and more than 30 others| whose words are mixed with as yet unseen archive footage.",
