    "introduction": "Jane is a 28-year-old Métis woman from a mixed Cree and French family. After many years away, she returns to her native village, a place filled with magic, located on an indigenous reserve in northern Quebec. The complex reunion with her family and community starts to fall apart, an unprecedented heat wave hits the country and the village is enveloped by a thick cloud of smoke. The black ash carried by the wind betrays alarming news: the forest is on fire and the flames are approaching. Abandoned by the government and left to their own devices, the inhabitants must join forces to fight the Dragon.",
