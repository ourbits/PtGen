    "introduction": "The film begins with a pretty girl on a swing, who dismounts and performs a striptease. She leaves, then Charlie and Beetle walk on-stage and engage in a friendly argument. A distraught woman walks by. When Charlie asks her what is wrong, she says her husband is out of work and they don't have any money, but all of the pawn brokers are closed. Charlie offers to serve as a pawn broker if she has something of value. The attractive young lady offers to pawn the clothing she is wearing. While Beetle remains skeptical of her intentions, Charlie proceeds to pay far too much for her clothes as she removes them one-by-one. It becomes obvious that Charlie has an ulterior motive for his charity, and finally Beetle attempts to join in on the fun.",
