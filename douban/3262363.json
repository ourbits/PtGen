    "introduction": "The ancient Greek tragedy Iphigeneia at Aulis by Euripides inspired this offbeat drama from filmmaker Ines de Oliveira Cezar. A long and punishing drought has plagued a community in Argentina, and one of the village leaders (Carlos Portaluppi) has decided he must do something to bring the rain. Convinced a human sacrifice will appease the fates, the man has chosen his daughter (Agustina Munoz) as the most fitting victim for the ritual. However, the girl is not willing to die for beliefs she does not share, and with her brother she flees to the desert, hoping to find sanctuary. Amidst all this, a Polish man (Maciej Robakiewicz) who has wandered into town struggles to understand the strange spectacle that surrounds him. Extranjera (aka Foreigner) was screened as part of the 2007 Berlin Film Festival.",
