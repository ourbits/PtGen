    "introduction": "Something's wrong with Fae. She's been going missing without explanation, winding up in a recovery center. Her younger sister, Dori, is worried. Is Fae schizophrenic? Is there really someone stalking her?  She sneaks a look at Fae's diary, and what she sees is disturbing: a drawing of something monstrous, made of shadows and tentacles. Suddenly, the lights start to fail. There's something coming for Fae, but Dori soon discovers that whatever it is – it's not of this world. As objects begin levitating and Fae is pulled into the sky by an unseen force, Dori risks everything to save her.",
