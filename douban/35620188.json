    "introduction": "Train to Zakopané is true love story that lays bare how compassion and intolerance can, even in the most unusual of circumstances, be one. Written and directed from his long-running play by Henry Jaglom and adapted for film together with producer/editor Ron Vignone, the film reveals humanity in the most unlikely of places: prejudice. The film is based on true events that occurred in the life of Henry Jaglom's father as he crossed Poland on a train in 1928. Anti-Semitism was, at that time, rife in much of Europe, especially in Poland. In Train to Zakopané, a successful young Russian businessman meets a captivating nurse in the Polish army on a train-trip to Warsaw and is faced with a life-changing dilemma when he discovers that the nurse he is drawn to-and who is enchanted by him-is fiercely anti-Semitic. Will he reveal to her he is Jewish? Will he move toward love, or will he move toward revenge? The actual train-ride across Poland-and the weekend stopover in the resort town of Zakopané that followed-haunted Henry Jaglom's father for a lifetime.",
