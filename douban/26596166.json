    "introduction": "In 2010 L'IMEC which runs Alain Robbe-Grillet's fund, asked Volker Schlondorff (together with Bernard-Henry Lévy who coproduced the film) to comment some previously unreleased footage made by Françoise SPIRA during the shooting of Last Year in Marienbad.Françoise Spira was in the cast and filmed the shooting in super 8 between the takes.After she passed away, her husband exhumed these rolls and entrusted them to Alain Robbe-Grillet.The choice of Schlondorff was obvious for he was Resnais'assistant on the film and mostly because his recollection seems to resurface with the discovery of those pictures just as Delphine Seyrig's memory seems to wake up with Giorgio Albertazzi's voice in Marienbad itself.Though the film itself is rather poor (no sound except Schlondorff's voice over and some extracts from Resnais'film), there's a must to see moment of strange collision between Marienbad and \"Night and Fog\" when Spira, Schlondorff, Sacha Pitoef and his wife take advantage of a break to visit a village which celebrates the \"october feast\" a few yards from Dachau.Once again, Resnais' masterpiece generates mystery and fascination.",
