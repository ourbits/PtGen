    "introduction": "In the murky streets of postwar Pristina 2009, a group of children sell cigarettes and whisper tales of loss and hope. Now young adults with children of their own, the war lingers on in their hearts, and they still fight for survival and dignity in one of Europe's youngest and poorest nations. The only escape from the harshness of their reality is religious fundamentalism or emigration. A collective portrait of a state of being, set in a world now marked by a new devastating war in Europe.The children transform into adults before our eyes. Yet they remain in limbo, haunted by memories of the war in Kosovo. Combining raw realism and staged performance, Afterwar is a meditation on the long-term repercussions of war.",
