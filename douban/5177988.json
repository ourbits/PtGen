The girl's sister joins them and they drive to meet their father in his summerhouse. This unexpected crime, which took them to this road, becomes a road to each other and to themselves. They realize on this road that their lives are about running away, disappearance, coincidence, insanity, failures and dreams - and most important of all a deep anxiety. Lodos, which is a strong Mediterranean wind, will follow them all the way.",
