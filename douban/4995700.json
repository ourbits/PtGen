Walking away from her own wedding and committing a serious indiscretion at work sends Chantal's career on a downward spiral. Letting his relationship fall apart, Zach develops an obsession for documenting the lonely voices of the city. Chantal and Zach meet at the bottom. In ways neither could have imagined, they help each to find a cure each so badly needs. On the way, though, they discover that healing wounds can come at unforeseen costs.",
