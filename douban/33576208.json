    "introduction": "Juicy pomegranates dangle from a tree branch, beyond the green grasshopper’s reach. Going after them would be a risky move for the tiny creature stalked by a praying mantis, gluttonous locusts and a hungry rooster. Luckily, life is full of surprises – like this charming film, which brings Chinese watercolour painting to life with the aid of digital animation. Set to the tones of traditional wind and string instruments, an enchanting world emerges.",
