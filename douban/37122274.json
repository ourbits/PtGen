The film's all trans cast includes activist and model Munroe Bergdorf, model, singer and star of US reality show 'Strut', Laith Ashley, Youtuber and fitness model Kieran Moloney, Captain Hannah Winterbourne of the British Army, and writer and director Jake Graf. Headspace offers an as yet unseen insight into the every day transgender experience, and will hopefully promote much needed acceptance and understanding.",
