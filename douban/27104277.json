    "introduction": "On Christmas eve the royals head for Sandringham , taken out of moth-balls for the occasion and Camilla is not happy when Kate declares that she wants to cook the dinner for the family, despite scary Princess Anne's austerity measures. Nor is Charles pleased to learn that a referendum prefers William as king, rather than his father, with the ghost of George III chipping in to help reach a decision. Pippa is annoyed when Harry deserts her to help singer Ellie Goulding organize a soup kitchen for the homeless but Beatrice and Eugenie are thrilled to see their parents reconciled - until they discover their father's motive. Camilla continues to sabotage Kate's culinary efforts, aided by the presence of the homeless people invited by Harry but it is Kate who saves the day when Charles' misguided Christmas speech almost starts a war with Europe.",
