    "introduction": "A smart satire that sports a wicked streak of goofball humor, DESTINATION: PLANET NEGRO! has the feel of low-budget 1950s sci-fi, as leaders including W.E.B. DuBois and George Washington Carver kick off a secret plot to solve the “Negro Problem” by way of a rocket ship to Mars. Carrying a crew of three, the spacecraft vaults into a time warp, landing its brave scientists in a present-day Midwestern metropolis, where this comedy takes on the look of a reality show as the astonished adventurers discover unbelievable developments like young men with drooping pants and the election of a black president.",
