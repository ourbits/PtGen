While Frank is tracking the source of money which his late father, a protagonist of the Slovenian independence, made through shady dealings, Brane resorts to his lawyers and a network of his father’s “cronies”, who are no strangers to mafia tactics. Brane’s wife Ines, who has in fact loved with Frank all along, finds caught between the two brothers once more.",
