    "introduction": "The night of July 6, 2013, changed the small, picturesque town of Lac-Mégantic in Quebec's Eastern Townships (in Canada) in unfathomable and horrifying ways. In a matter of minutes, 47 people were killed instantly, and more than 2,000 were displaced when an unattended train derailed nearby. What exactly transpired that night? Now a decade later, Academy Award-nominated director Philippe Falardeau revisits the event, offering viewers a detailed post-mortem of the events leading to one of Canada's worst rail disasters. Through interviews with the families of those who died, former and current town officials and the men held responsible, this riveting and carefully crafted four-part series details the shocking sequence of decisions that ultimately led to a spill of more than 7.7 million litres of crude oil, irreversibly changing the lives of everyone in town. A true-crime docuseries with lessons for the future.",
