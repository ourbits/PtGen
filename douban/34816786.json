    "introduction": "Richard Gaikowski films inside San Francisco's notorious \"Deaf Club\" in the early era of punk rock during 1979, where most patrons are part of the Golden Gate City's deaf community, who share the enjoyment of the music through the vibrations they feel through the raucous sound of punk rock being basted from the amplifiers. The crowd wildly dances to the music of punk/ska band The Offs as they perform the songs \"Zero Degrees\" and \"624803\" in the crowded venue.",
