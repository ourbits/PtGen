    "introduction": "The magnetic Elda wants to become a rock star. When she’s not singing on stage, she is Diego Detona, a teacher who lives with his family in Concordia and has certain doubts about his transition. What is the true alter ego? The determined, ambitious Elda or the shy, insecure Diego? He tries to find the answer by going on a pilgrimage to the altar of a trans woman who was murdered and then turned into La Muda (The Mute), some sort of popular saint the townspeople visit in order to ask for help. Accompanying the protagonist of this film in this road trip on foot allows us to expand an entire array of experiences and, above all, see Elda as she discovers new ways of bonding with others and with her own identity. With eloquent charm, Nicolás Herzog proves once more that he is capable of covering great passions and building characters around them.源自：https://www.mardelplatafilmfest.com/38/en/pelicula/elda-y-los-monstruos",
