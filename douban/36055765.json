    "introduction": "The comedy sees Giovanni awaken from a coma 31 years after he was hit on the head by a flag during the funeral of the Italian Communist Party’s long-term leader Enrico Berlinguer in the summer of 1984. Everything has changed. The world he left behind him no longer exists: his family, his girlfriend, his beloved political party… Everything is in pieces in this new era. Giovanni is like a fifty-year-old child, he must learn how to manoeuvre in this new dimension, how to accept the loss of old bonds and how to forge new ones. He’s helped by Giulia, a young and tormented nun who took care of him in the later years of his hospitalisation, and Leo, a problematic boy with selective mutism. Thanks to them, Giovanni not only regains his normal vital functions, he also finds a way of understanding his new existence and facing up to the past, which will come back to him in the form of Francesca, his daughter from his previous life.",
