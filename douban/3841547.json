    "introduction": "讲述厄瓜多尔独立战争的故事。Ecuador's thwarted first stab at gaining independence from Spain is dramatized in the \"1809-1810: Before Dawn.\" Capably mounted but a bit too bloodless, costumer is a watchable history lesson lacking the emotional or stylistic punch needed to tempt offshore theatrical takers. Nonetheless, it reps an attractive pickup for Spanish-language broadcasters.Hoping other provinces will follow suit, revolutionists in Quito hand their declaration of independence to the Viceroy's local representative. Military re-enforcements promptly take a hundred rebels prisoners. While they await execution, others in hiding continue urging dissent, helped by outsiders -- including sympathetic Catholic clergy, widowed scholar Pedro (Aristides Vargas) and the latter's sole female student Judit (Marilu Vaca), a mixed-race painter's daughter whose nut job husband got thrown into jail with the rebels. She and Pedro -- a most uninspiring May-December romantic duo -- realize their love amid increasingly risky situations, not the least the close scrutiny of genteel but crown-loyal Col. Arredondo (Gonzalo Gonzalo), who also has the hots for Judit. Tragic tale is decently produced and acted, but helmer Camilo Luzuriaga's (\"La Tigra\") too-steady hand misses ample opportunities to crank up dramatic urgency.",
