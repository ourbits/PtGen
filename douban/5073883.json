    "introduction": "After discovering that her elderly fiance has false teeth, a young bride-to-be becomes so distraught that she contemplates suicide. She is rescued by a young sailor, with whom she has a baby, which she eventually delivers by Caesarian section.This film stirred up a storm upon release for its depiction of a Caesarian birth. Though not much was really shown, it was enough to cause women filmgoers—and not a few men—to faint. The film was banned outright in Germany and ran into some censorship problems in the US; still, by its very controversial nature it proved to be a hit wherever it was shown.",
