    "introduction": "miscellaneousphotographssound clipsvideo clipsAuthor: gurdeepsian from United KingdomBasically what you get on this DVD is a 1 hour documentary on the classic 1994 album Definitely Maybe. The documentary is an analysis on each of the songs (including bonus track \"sad song\"), and they also talk about the journey of making this album. You also get live performances of all the songs which were recorded from various venues. And one of the things I like about this DVD is that it contains the music videos for all the songs released from the album (the \"live forever\" video is the US version). There is a Limited Edition version which contains a bonus DVD. On this DVD there are two more live performances (of live forever and the Beatles song I am the Walrus). Also there are more interviews with the band on making the album.I hope another DVD will be released for \"whats the story (morning glory)?\"",
