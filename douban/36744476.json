Until she met Kagan. A naive love story, which sounds like the initials of the name embroidered on a cloth handkerchief, turns into a whirlwind that engulfs all of her loved ones with it. She begins to drift away from her sheltered world which was surrounded by the men of her family who loved and cared about her, towards the dark universe of Kagan.",
