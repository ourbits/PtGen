Co-curated by Renen Schorr, founding director of the JSFS, and Maryanne Redpath, head of Generation, the programme presents six short films from the years 1997 to 2015 and examines the lives of young Israelis, which have been shaped by conflict and siege: A Scarred Generation.Roy has spent a long, hot day with his parents at the beach. When he makes his dad promise to take home a little sand as a keepsake, the family finds itself in the midst of a restricted military area – and a very risky situation.",
