    "introduction": "Based on a true story. In 1915, a mountain village in Japan was attacked by a giant bear, dubbed “Red Spot”, who terrorized the villagers for days, murdering the men and carrying off the women to save for a late night meal. Sonny Chiba (`Kill Bill`), in his directorial debut, and special advisor Kinji Fukasaku (“Battle Royale”) present a film based on this terrifying real life incident. YELLOW FANGS tells the story of a young bear hunter living in the village of Hawk’s Hills, Japan. When Yuki, a young woman recently kicked out of her home, spends the night with him, a giant bear attacks her home, kills her father, her brothers and carries her mother off into the mountains. The bear hunters gather together and go after the beast but he forbids Yuki to follow. Undaunted, Yuki disguises herself as a boy and goes after “Red Spot” herself.",
