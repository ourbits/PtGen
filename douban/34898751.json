    "introduction": "Simon has been a compulsive liar since childhood. His family, friends and colleagues organize an intervention to tell him that enough is enough and that he must stop. Unfortunately, it turns into a confrontation and Simon denies having told all these lies. The next morning, he wakes up in a reality where all the lies he has ever told are proven facts: his car always has a flat tire, his colleague is sleeping at work, his sister-in-law has a crush on him. - In the eyes of others, this reality has always been like that. Fortunately, Simon's twin brother is also aware that this reality is not their original reality and he pushes Simon to face his problem in order to get out of this bad situation.",
