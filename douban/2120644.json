    "introduction": "Documentary about rock n roll pioneer Roger Kynard \"Roky\" Erickson, whose band the 13th Floor Elevators coined the term \"psychedelic rock\" in the 60's. Struggling with drug abuse and schizophrenia, he spent 3 years in Rusk State Hospital after pleading insanity on marijuana charges. His new band, Roky Erickson and the Aliens managed to stay vital during the 70's with a darker and more aggressive rock sound. After losing interest in music, he became a recluse, living in poverty and filth. The movie details the rise and fall of Roky Erickson and his brothers struggle to get Rokys life back on track.",
