    "introduction": "Firestarter marks Bangarra Dance Theatre's 30th anniversary. Taking us through Bangarra's birth and spectacular growth, the film recognises Bangarra's founders and tells the story of how three young Aboriginal brothers - Stephen, David and Russell Page - turned the newly born dance group into a First Nations cultural powerhouse. Through the eyes of the brothers and company alumni, Firestarter explores the loss and reclaiming of culture, the burden of intergenerational trauma, and - crucially - the power of art as a messenger for social change and healing.",
