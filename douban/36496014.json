    "introduction": "A satirical 'documentary' that pokes a sharp and goofy finger at new-age religions, modern self-help movements (ala The Secret, Oprah, etc.) and their seductive 'you can have everything you've ever wanted' message. Tripp Bailey, a washed-up journalist and wanna-be documentarian, as he tries to infiltrate and debunk Pyrasphere, 'Hollywood's Fastest-growing New Religion.' Along the way, Tripp encounters a colorful collection of cultists (including his ex-wife) and their glamorous guru, Gossamyrhh, whose fame-hungry philosophies lead him down a path where he must choose between his own selfish ambitions and his 'journalistic integrity.'",
