    "introduction": "December 6, 1989. Sylvie GAGNON was attending her last day of classes at Ecole Polytechnique, an engineering school in Montreal, when Marc LEPINE entered the building. Systematically separating the women from the men, he opened fire on women students, yelling \"You're all a bunch of feminists.\" Sylvie survived a bullet wound to the head while fourteen other women were murdered. After the Montreal Massacre is a useful tool for helping us come to terms with these murders and how they relate to the larger picture of male violence against women.",
