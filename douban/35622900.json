    "introduction": "When a miracle appears at your door, it usually does so in silence. Hochul(Kim Ju-hun) and Youngran (Ryu Hyun-kyung), the owners of two cafes, fall in love with each other and plan to live together. However, they must wait for the time being because of the remaining real estate contracts. One day, they have a small car accident. In order to keep it quiet, they decide to take care of the young man involved, named Suk (Kim Sin-bi) about whom they know nothing. By portraying the simple fortunes that come to us like unexpected gifts, Fairy reminds us of the precious moments in our lives. Hochul and Youngran are both burdened with the responsibilities for their families, which brings about increasing struggles between them. The film, however, keeps focusing on the heartwarming relationship instead of encouraging to worsen the struggles between them. With the actors' natural and unexaggerated performances, it brings simple and savory happiness to audience. (SONG Kyung-won)",
