    "introduction": "\"A California Desert Rhapsody\" - A feature-length essay film documentary that places Antonioni's counterculture art film Zabriskie Point (1970) and Stanley Kramer's madcap epic comedy It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World (1963) within the same narrative universe, as orchestrated and narrated by filmmaker, film historian, editor, and archivist Daniel Kremer. In seamlessly editing together sequences and shots from the two films, Kremer soon realizes that the exercise effortlessly draws cultural and historical parallels in twentieth-century American life that echo and resonate in present-day America. University radical Mark Frechette flies his stolen aircraft right past the one piloted by Mickey Rooney and Buddy Hackett as they spin out of control. Daria Halprin ignores a hitchhiking Jonathan Winters. Milton Berle leaps right into a cascade of amorous sand-covered bodies. Spencer Tracy and Daria Halprin in a torrid extramarital affair? Beatnik surfer Dick Shawn phone-pranks capitalist pig Rod Taylor? It's all here.",
