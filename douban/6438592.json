    "introduction": "December 2010 will see the fortieth anniversary of the Kniefall von Warschau. BROADVIEW TV is marking the occasion with a 90-minute HDTV docudrama that offers an incisive glimpse behind the scenes of Brandt's Ostpolitik and a revealing insight into the contradictory personality of this German chancellor. The award-winning writers Sebastian Dehnhardt and Manfred Oldenburg focus on Brandt's personality and his struggle against domestic and foreign resistance in his fight for reconciliation and a more peaceful world. The film includes the period of his chancellorship from 1969 till 1974. Interviews with close confidants, people who accompanied him for many years and his opponents as well, paint an intimate psychological portrait of Willy Brandt, the man and the politician.",
