    "introduction": "Two little birds. One with a red beak, the other with a black beak. They find themselves competing when a stork flies over their home and leaves behind a lonely egg. Both birds try to warm and care for the egg, eagerly wondering what will hatch from it. As the big moment nears, they are surprised by what emerges.This episode by the experienced Uruguayan filmmakers Sodergit and Schettini features the feathered and playful “yin and yang” brothers of the avian world exploring the notion of rivalry and offers a heartwarming perspective on friendship and the joy of sharing.",
