    "introduction": "The close down of an old sugar mill in Mauritius, calls into question the lives of Marco and his friends, a group of former workmates in their mid fifties. In this country where sugar cane has always been the nourishing mother earth, the characters find themselves suddenly trapped between inescapable modernity and living conditions they find it all the harder to accept. The last sugar canes are cut down, revealing new ephemeral horizons and the deep ties that unite them all.",
