    "introduction": "This time, the period is my childhood, in 1991. In January of that year, Moscow carried out an unsuccessful coup in the newly independent Lithuania. The most ridiculous outcome of that coup was a propaganda TV channel that no one watched and no one wanted to work at. Among the few who did work there, the most important person was a Lithuanian officer from the Soviet military intelligence agency. He was one of the few who would dare to appear in public, preaching about the collapsing Soviet regime using the most outdated slogans. The press would call him “Judah”.",
