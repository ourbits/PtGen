A call from the past breaks this pleasant stability. Nina's ex-boyfriend Ruslan is seriously ill and asks her to come to Tbilisi to see him, perhaps for the last time. Her husband doesn't mind it, he’s aware of their relationship in the past. Nina goes to the city, where she was happy, to support Ruslan like a friend. She is sure that she loves her husband and that she will return home soon. But this light journey becomes her last one.",
