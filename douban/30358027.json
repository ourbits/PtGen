Their clients are exclusivley  German seniors, who travel across the nearby border to the tiny Polish village, in search of inexpensive cuts. While occupying the barber chair they share their dreams, fears, and life stories.  Halina's wish is that Andżela stays with her until the end of her days, but will Andżela put her own dreams aside to stay with Halina in the salon?",
