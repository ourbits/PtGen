    "introduction": "Sandra is a single mother. She lives with her teenage son and works as a security guard. One morning, on taking a different bus route than usual to a new security post, she meets Javier behind the wheel. The two often coincide on his routes and her strong attraction to him leads to an affair. In the midst of exhausting working days, they enjoy time off with their colleagues. Sandra squares up to her personal life, realises that she is much more than a mother and embarks on a road to freedom through her own experience of desire.",
