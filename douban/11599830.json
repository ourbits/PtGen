    "introduction": "A subtle meditation on the contradictions of British colonial history in South East Asia, filmed in Penang. This cinematic reverie features a group of antifascist Malay skinheads in a series of languorous tableaux, set to a lysergic, blissed out soundtrack. Adopting the typically British subculture, they traverse time and space, restoring its progressive, late sixties origins as an expression of solidarity between Anglo- and Caribbean working-class youth. The film highlights ‘style tribes’ as a form of social rebellion and an expression of the universal desire to adopt and inhabit identity, whilst staking out modes of independence.",
