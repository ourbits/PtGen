    "introduction": "SynopsisJeong-ja isn’t especially pretty or talented. She’s just an old maid in her thirties who works at the ticket booth of a theater on the outskirts of town. She has an inadequate sense of reality and spends most of her day daydreaming. It’s a hot summer’s day, and because Jeong-ja cannot take time off from her job, she waits for her blind date at the theater ticket booth all day long. But the date does not show up and after a short nap, Jeong-ja follows a handsome stranger who comes out of the theater as he goes out for a walk. At that moment, there’s a thunderstorm. The man disappears and Jeong-ja returns to the theater, drenched and there, she finds her blind date waiting for her.NotesAn archetypical example of a Korean independent film of the 1990s. (Kang So-won)Deals with the psychology of the characters in a faithful and objective manner. (Kim Dong-won)",
