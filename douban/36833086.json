Almost 1000 men have come forward as survivors of Kitagawa's abuse. But a climate of hostility to survivors means some are facing online abuse that has resulted in tragic consequences. Meanwhile, the story of wider abuse at the agency is going untold. Mobeen Azhar investigates the aftermath of a predator.",
