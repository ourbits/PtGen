Lyuba is to become an actress and marry a classmate and a young poet Seryozha, who is madly in love with her. Alina - to marry Wilka. And Sonya only dreams of meeting her lover - very smart, well-read, interesting, and in every possible way avoids Osya, who is deeply in love with her. Anya has her own secret plans, which she is in no hurry to share with anyone. It seems to them that the whole world is open and ready to embrace them. But thirty-year-old journalist Andrey, almost an old man in Lyuba's eyes, understands what horror is coming, and confuses the girl's ardent heart with his impudent \"slanderous fabrications.\" Outside is the summer of 1940. And the lot of young heroes falls to the war, which will make them grow up too quickly and realize that only true love helps not to break down and withstand the most cruel trials.",
