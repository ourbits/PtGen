Together with his little brother, he re-enacts the most daring stunts from the series and wreaks a lot of havoc in their high-rise neighborhood. Surprisingly, Jachym's father has little understanding for his passion for Michael Knight. But when the demonstrations begin in the fall of 1989, Jachym and Michael Knight hatch a plan to prove themselves to everyone.",
