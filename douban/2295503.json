    "introduction": "March 11, 2002. John R., a heavily-armed, 59-year-old bus driver, takes employees in the Rembrandt Tower in Amsterdam hostage. Six months after September 11, police and government officials are in a serious state of panic. The man is protesting against widescreen TV and thinks the black bars in widescreen broadcasts contain hidden codes. At the end of the day, John brings his own life to a dramatic end. No one has ever understood what drove this man. For years he led a crusade against widescreen TV and other modern technology, writing numerous letters to newspapers, electronics companies and consumers organizations. Dismissing John R. as a madman, however, is too simple a response. Behind this man is a larger personal tragedy. His crusade had been so all-consuming that his wife divorced him and their children were embarrassed: they changed their surnames and avoided their father. But like many madmen, John's fight was based on a kernel of truth. Only 5% of Dutch programming is widescreen and the receivers are twice as expensive as normal TVs. Digital sets are on their way. From this point of view, widescreen TV seems driven more by marketing than any genuine technological advance. Like many other people, John R. felt manipulated. Unlike most people, however, John's feelings evolved into paranoia. How fine is that line and are there more people like John waiting to cross it?",
