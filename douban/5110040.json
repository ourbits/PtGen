    "introduction": "This movie is to me rather excellent in its sense. The story of how one young boy sees his own mother's rape & murder while travelling from Ukraine to Poland to visit his father(who he has never seen as his parents separated). The father must now care for 8 year old Michal as he goes through depression. This movie shows how the 2 strangers bond, becoming father and son. The father has trouble discipling Michal, but gets to know him better and love him. However, the father's girlfriend isn't happy and wants him to send the child back to Ukraine, or to an orphanage. When Michal overhears the conversation, he gets upset as he thinks his dad will send him away, thus he runs away planning to return to Ukraine himself. The father then realises how much he loves Michal, and chooses his son over his girlfriend, which to me is the best decision he's ever made. While he searches for Michal, we see Michal hitching rides, spotting the foursome who brutally murdered his mother and avenged her on his own by burning their vehicle. The boy is found later and sent back to Ukraine while his dad is at the border and spots him being taken away. Michal screams for his father and his father shouts back that he'll get Michal back no matter what.",
