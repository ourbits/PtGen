    "introduction": "SEASIDE SPECIAL is a love letter to Brexit Britain: a consciously warm-hearted look at Britain’s only remaining “End-of-the-Pier” variety show – far away from London – as the town of Cromer and the cast prepare for the 2019 summer season.The film portrays a town from a different time, full of quintessentially British types, but which also offers a highly topical outlook: It’s about attitude, craftsmanship, and authenticity. It’s about community and values, about the humor of our British neighbors, their originality, and their quirks – which we as Europeans will sorely miss.",
