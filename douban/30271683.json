    "introduction": "An island paradise, big business, complex characters, love and betrayal set the scene for this romantic adventure film. A rich American woman travels to the Cook Islands for business with her new husband and finds herself stranded on a deserted island with a man who has a secret past and no time for her. With drama, action, intrigue and comedy at every turn, they connect and escape the island for his ugly past to be revealed. They are rescued and the story goes through another twist to leave audience gasping and wanting more. The story begins with the arrival of a loud and confident New York business woman, 'Julia' (age early to mid-30's), newly appointed president of a multinational property development company, in the island paradise of Cooks. The story rapidly develops into a gripping mix of intrigue, romance and adventure culminating in a finale that while it ticks the right exotic, romantic, adventure and action boxes also has the added element of surprise that would have been hard for a viewer to predict.",
