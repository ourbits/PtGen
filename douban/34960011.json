In his quest, Benny stumbles across a journal that belonged to his great great grandfather, the famous gunslinger Bulletproof Jackson. Benny opens the journal and we are brought back to the wild west where we learn the true legend of Bulletproof and perhaps the secret that will save the Saloon. But for Benny, the journal holds many more questions than answers.....Bulletproof is made by Zeno film camp and many of the actors have disabilities. No one is paid or pays to be a part of Zeno Films and all proceeds of the movie go towards our next movie.",
