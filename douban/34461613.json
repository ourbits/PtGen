    "introduction": "A new six-part comedy series, written by and starring Amy Huberman as Joy, a woman who finds herself thrust into the limelight as she tries to get over a break-up. The show also stars Aisling Bea, Laura Whitmore and Jennifer Rainsford.Joy is totally fine... No matter what her dog, Canine Aidan, thinks. She may have just broken up with her long-term boyfriend, Aidan, and her best friend Trish is busy having a baby, but she’s perfectly happy with her secluded and orderly life. Her career is also trundling along nicely, until she receives an unwanted new job, filling in for Ireland’s most-beloved vlogger, Flora the Happy Hunter (at least until the swelling from a dodgy skin resurfacing dies down).This new job catapults Joy into the unknown, and unwelcome, world of social media stardom, where she must share her fears, feelings, and wardrobe malfunctions with the world as she goes to great heights to find… well joy.",
