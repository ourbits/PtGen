    "introduction": "There was a time when this techno band was the most distinctive German band in the world. What was once funfair music is today a cultish 30-million-record-selling phenomenon. With slogans like \"Hyper! Hyper!\" and \"How much is the Fish?\", Scooter became internationally known – including in Estonia. And indeed, the film shows a pivotal scene of success for the band and fans alike, here in Tallinn.The doc interweaves private, exclusive archive material from the 29-year history of the band with frontman H.P. Baxxter’s emotional highs and lows during the Covid-19 pandemic that raised the question of what happens when parties and gigs and many other expressions of culture are banned?Director Cordula Kablitz-Post, who has also made films of other major music acts coming out of Germany, including Nina Hagen, combines intimacy, big stadium moments and a candid look at how the specific style of Scooter anthem mayhem came into being.源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/fck-2020-2-and-half-years-with-scooter/",
