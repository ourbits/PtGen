    "introduction": "Spaghetti with Chorizo Western crammed with action , shootouts and lots of violence . An Italian-Spanish co-production with interior filmed at Roman Studios and outdoor sequences filmed in Madrid and of course Almeria, Spain . It's full of action , exaggerated characters, shootouts and loads of violence . One gang deadly in his violence (Ennio Girolami , Mariano Vidal Molina) attacks a little town whose sheriff is Donovan (rather secondary role by Richard Harrison) ; a murder is committed and results to be accused a reverend , ex-gunfighter , named Miller (Guy Madison , the real starring along with German Cobos) . The priest is detained but he gets away . The gang commits atrocity and kills each person involved in their robberies . Meanwhile a diverse group (German Cobos , Alfonso Rojas , Maria Salerno , Perla Cristal , Maria Martin, Chris Huerta) travels to West when is attacked by the deadly band . They are helped by the priest and get escape and arrive in a fortified village but are suddenly besieged by the band formed to chase them . There takes place violent fights , facing off , and final duel .It's an exciting western with breathtaking showdown between the protagonist a priest gunfighter , Guy Madison, and a band's leader , Ennio Girolami , and his hoodlums . Both of whom are fine , they ravage the screen, kill , shoot , hit and run . There is plenty of thrills and action in the movie , guaranteeing some shoot'em up or stunts every few minutes . Furthermore, there appears usual Italian/Spanish Western secondaries as Rafael Albaicin, Jose Canalejas , Mariano Vidal Molina , Alfonso Rojas , Frank Braña and Perla Cristal . Comic relief in charge of Chris Huerta , as a likable Scottish including the typical skirt . The film blends violence , high body-count and it's fast moving and quite entertaining . There is a very odd implementation of shots in the camera work during some particular scenes as the film approaches its climax , as in the ending gunfights and the customary showdown conclusion . There are fine technicians and nice production design by Jose Luis Galicia , an expert set decorator who along with Cubero designed innumerable Westerns , he creates an acceptable scenario with barren outdoors , dirty landscapes under a glimmer sun and an atmospheric set on the little town and the surrounded village . The musician Gianni Ferrio composes a nice soundtrack and well conducted . Striking cinematography by Fusi in Eastmancolor, with negative regularly processed , being necessary a perfect remastering . Interior filmed at Ballesteros Studios (Madrid), De Paolis Studios (Rome) and outdoor sequences filmed at Colmenar Viejo and of course Almeria, where in the 60s and 70s were shot innumerable Spaghetti . The motion picture produced by Marino Girolami , Ennio Girolami's father , is middlingly directed by Leon Klimovsky . Leon was a craftsman who directed all kind genres , as Terror for Paul Naschy ( Marshall of hell, Rebellion of dead one, Orgy of vampires , Werewolf shadow,Dr Jekill vs. the werewolf), Warlike (June 44 attack force Normandy , A bullet for Rommel , Bridge over Elba) and Western ( Badland drifter , Some dollars for Django, Torrejon city , Death knows no time , Two thousand dollars for Coyote , A dollar for Sartana) . Rating: 4,5 ; regular but entertaining .",
