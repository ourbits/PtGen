    "introduction": "Very important animation. This reveals the not so politically-correct real views of Nakazawa Keiji, in place of the dumbed down and gentrified Hadashi no Gen.More illustrative of actual views at the time. The manga, which this seems to only be loosely based off, was serialised in 'Manga Panchi' and other Adult-Male-near-Pornographic magazines. Nakazawa only got the chance to tell a censored version of his own story when he met a co-operative editor at Weekly Shonen Jump [Shueisha] in 1971. He got to publish a one shot called Ore wa Mita, before his concept of Hadashi no Gen was greenlighted. When the editor was promoted, his work was not so accepted, and he would spend the rest of serialisation of Hadashi no Gen being flitted around publishers/magazines, including Union and Educational magazines.",
