    "introduction": "2019 年巴黎圣母院火灾成为电影制片人反思过去 100 年来天主教会机构中所发生的虚伪和不公正现象的催化剂。通过大满贯诗歌文本的表演以及手绘动画和真实镜头的混合，创建了一个元叙事，强调需要找到超越暴力的解决方案。The fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in 2019 serves as a catalyst for the filmmaker to reflect on the hypocrisies and injustices that have occurred in Catholic Church institutions over the past 100 years. Through the performance of a slam poetry text and a mix of hand-drawn animation and real footage, a meta-narrative is created that emphasizes the need to find a solution to these problems that goes beyond violence.",
