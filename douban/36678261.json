When her car is mysteriously stolen, Andrea is forced to hitch a ride with a seemingly friendly, but strange woman named Betty who drops her off at a haunted mansion on the hill. Inside, Andrea uncovers a Halloween party featuring a collection of unusual guests, and a even more strange family of occultists, in costumes.
