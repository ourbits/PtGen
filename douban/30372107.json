    "introduction": "A work of \"archival vérité\" and a meta-reflection on the role of the camera as both a weapon and a maker of history, Evidence of the Evidence chronicles the infamous 1971 Attica prison uprising. This radical yet tragic event in the history of the American Civil Rights Movement is represented through a granular and visceral interrogation of a collection of video footage shot by a rank and file state trooper on the ground at Attica. In an era of resurgent racism and authoritarianism throughout the West, Johnston's film is a timely and urgent work of both agit-prop and media criticism.",
