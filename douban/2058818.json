    "introduction": "The mini-series produced by Rai Fiction and Ciao Ragazzi, is the first television production that tackles the life and work of the popular scientist and is a portrait of a genius who does not neglect his private side and that takes moves in 1948 when Einstein moved to Princeton almost seventy years after he left Germany to escape Nazism. It just there one night reunion his first wife Mileva Maric, the mother of his two sons who had not seen since 1932, and together address the unresolved issues of their relationship and retrace the main stages of their lives: the first scientific studies with Mileva mathematical knowledge in the service of the genius of Albert, the need to face the hostility of the academic and the popular use of the patent office to deal with economic difficulties, the conception of the first son, Hans Albert and marriage, the first publications and the early successes, as well as conflicts between them that even the birth of their second child and is able to overcome that lead to the end of their wedding to coincide with the end of WWI.The second part of the story takes off from the confirmation of the theories of the scientist by the Royal Society and sees Einstein emigrate to the U.S., where he worked at American nuclear program with the intent to overcome the Russians. The new world war and especially the bombs exploded on Hiroshima and Nagasaki upset Einstein, who is overwhelmed by guilt for his participation in the project and participated in antiwar protests in the sights ponensodi that the FBI suspected supporter of the Communists. The last years of life of the scientist is close with his will and scientific spiriturale, focused on a vision of cosmic harmony, dictated to a nurse and still not fully understood.The approach chosen by Cavani is to address not only the indisputable and already known to Einstein's contribution to the field of scientific progress, but also the human being behind this success: a lot of diversity in terms of its ratings for human sphere, an aspect that has led the authors to investigate the subject, even relying on numerous anecdotes about his life, to get a quad as much as possible realistic one of the leading figures in the last second.So the authors decided to focus on three main blocks, namely the relationship with Mileva, the one with the children and the commitment to pacifism and is coming off the image of a man plagued with many fears and weaknesses, sometimes petty, but at the same time able to show of generosity, and with a keen sense of humor and a great curiosity about everything around him. A genius in his field, unable to demonstrate the same safety and greatness in life and especially unable to understand and define something abstract and unpredictable as can be love for a woman.(excerpt of review by Antionio Cuomo; google translation from Italian)",
