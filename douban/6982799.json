Hundreds of thousands of young people have become victims of this particular consequence of the poor economic situation, forced to forget about ‘impractical’ university education and take on menial positions, such as call-centre jobs. This is the fate of Gianfranco, hero of writer-director Federico Rizzo’s acerbic comedy. A promising graduate of volcanology, Gianfranco receives life’s first slap in the face in the form of a headset with microphone, with which, armed with a set of standard questions, he is forced to plough his way through a list of randomly selected homeowners, day after day. His girlfriend Marzia, an ambitious reporter, isn’t much better off as a switchboard operator for an erotic hotline. Rizzo’s ironic, highly stylised film is punctuated by interviews with real-life precariati, offering their insight into the insane nature of ubiquitous call centres”",
