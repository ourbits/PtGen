    "introduction": "6% of population, which means nearly three hundred thousands of people in Hong Kong are ethnic minorities. Their voices cannot be heard from mainstream media and we know little about their lives, their stories. This film follows three participants of a video training camp for teen-aged ethnic minorities in Hong Kong: Albin (Japanese), Olique (Bangladeshi) and Hammed (Indian). Their stories raise a series of issues where EM teenagers in Hong Kong have been facing, ranging from the bullying problem in secondary school to the difficulty of adapting to the learning environment in the university. Above all, this films aims at reflecting on two critical questions - 'what minority really means?' and 'how is it expressed by visual creation?'",
