    "introduction": "A city tour through the architecture of an Online Shooter. Operation Jane Walk is based on the dystopian multiplayer shooter Tom Clancy’s: The Division (Ubisoft Entertainment 2016). In this work, the game’s digital war zone is appropriated with the help of an artistic operation. Within the rules of the game’s software, the militaristic environment is being re-used for a pacifistic city tour. The urban flâneurs avoid the combats whenever possible and become peaceful tourists of a digital world, which is a detailed replica of Midtown Manhattan. While walking through the post-apocalyptic city, issues such as architecture history, urbanism and the game developer’s interventions into the urban fabric are being discussed.",
