    "introduction": "The picture tells the story of Molly, a 10 year-old girl who believes that if she learns to play the fiddle and wins the All Ireland championship, she can wake her father up from a coma. In the rehabilitation centre where her father is being treated, she befriends Malachy, a grumpy old man whom she hears playing the fiddle beautifully. Malachy challenges the friendship at first and over time, she coaxes him to teach her, learning that he has ‘magic in his hands.’ This brings Molly great hope that learning how to play like her father did will help him regain consciousness.",
