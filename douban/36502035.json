    "introduction": "A boyfriend, who can barely speak English, embarks on an overseas trip with his girlfriend, who takes charge of planning everything and even handles communication on his behalf. However, their journey turns into a nightmare when they barely make it to their accommodation, and strange knocking sounds start emanating from the room. To make matters worse, the girlfriend disappears while taking a shower, and the police immediately suspect the boyfriend. With meticulously crafted initial ominous situations, such as the flight delays, the rental car agency closing its doors, and a major traffic accident experienced shortly after getting into the car, audiences are easily drawn into the protagonist’s intense quest to find his missing girlfriend. Despite the language barrier, he manages to evade the relentless investigation of the local police and skillfully uncovers clues. Unexpected obstacles keep appearing one after another, propelling the story forward without a moment to catch your breath. At the climax of the confusion, when the full truth of the incident is revealed, and viewers are met with a shocking revelation that leaves them gasping in astonishment.
