Each episode will take an immersive look at one currently active group through the eyes of past devotees and get perspective from believers and leaders that are still inside.\n1. NXIVM\nAs a recruiter for multi-level marketing self-help group NXIVM, Sarah Edmondson brought thousands of people to the organization. In October of 2017, she exposed the group as a destructive sex-cult.\n2.

Children of God\nAmy Bril recounts her childhood growing up in the Children of God, a group notorious for pedophilia and \"religious\" prostitution.\n4. U.N.O.I.\nGrowing up in the United Nation of Islam (UNOI), Elijah Muhammad was forced into child labor, physical abuse and squalid living conditions. Today, he has a unique opportunity to speak to the FBI in hope of getting justice for himself and the other children abused by UNOI and its leader, Royall Jenkins', teachings.\n5. World Peace Unification Sanctuary\nFormer \"Moonie,\" Teddy Hose, tries to alert the public to a gun-obsessed Unification Church offshoot known as The Sanctuary Church of Newfoundland, PA.\n6. Twelve Tribes\nDespite their hippie persona and rustic community businesses, the Twelve Tribes have long stood accused of physically abusing children and subjugating of women.\n7. FLDS\nMany believed that when Warren Jeffs was sentenced to life in prison for child sexual assault, the problems within the FLDS community would be solved.\n8. The Survivors Speak Part 1\nFormer members of different groups meet to discuss their shared experiences with Elizabeth Vargas.\n9.
