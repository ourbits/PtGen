But when his daughter contacts him out of the blue and wants to see him for the first time in thirteen years the boundaries of Hughie's solid life begin to blur and the wounds of the past come back into sharp, painful focus. And when Hughie meets his granddaughter, who he never knew existed, he finds himself circling the contours of a life he thought lost, buried forever.",
