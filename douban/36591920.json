    "introduction": "The film is an examination of humanity through figures carved and painted on a rock. Cave paintings are mirrors through which ancient people are watching us as we are watching the images. Reflection on human destiny and art as the supreme vocation is the duo’s central subject. The film summarizes their years-long meditation into a vast canvas encompassing footage of paintings, exquisite animation, and a journey through space and time. It is also an attempt to revisit their archive and contemplate the images created by the filmmakers themselves many years ago in order to discover a connection between epochs.源自：https://doclisboa.org/2023/en/filmes/eleven-images-of-a-human/",
