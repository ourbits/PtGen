    "introduction": "a somewhat Chaplinesque comedy on man’s obsession with money (成金 means 'nouveau riche') – one of the early titles sums it up neatly : “there’s one reason for labor – money”. This is a film by Thomas Kurihara, a Japanese director who started his career in 1913 as an extra in Hollywood – he had been hired by Thomas Harper Ince, who was looking for oriental types – then returned to Japan in 1918 to become an important director of the \"pure film movement\"",
