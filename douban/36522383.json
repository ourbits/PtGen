    "introduction": "In Notes of Autumn, Ellie (Williams) is a fun-loving, classically trained pianist living in the city who gave up on her passion long ago. She now works for a hotel and always seems to be getting things wrong when musical inspiration strikes. Her best friend, Leo (Macfarlane), lives in the rustic outskirts of British Columbia. He’s a famous author with writer’s block who can’t finish another installment in his highly popular book series. They both need a change of scenery as the chilly days of autumn settle in and decide to swap places, ending up completely lost in new surroundings.Ellie gets tangled up in helping Leo’s neighbor, Sam (Rosner), put together a musical performance for a local fundraiser and comes to terms with why she quit music years ago. Meanwhile, Leo strikes up a friendship with Ellie’s good friend Matt (Porte) and opens himself up to writing something different that really inspires him. Their newfound friendships turn into something far more meaningful. As both Ellie and Leo take part in the joys of the autumn season, they also discover their hearts belong somewhere very different than they ever thought possible.",
