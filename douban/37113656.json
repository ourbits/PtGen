In it, he discloses the secret to successful downsizing, explains why the whole “Do unto others” thing doesn’t work in marriage, and why boiling pasta naked is never a good idea. And for absolutely no additional charge, you will come to understand why finding raisins in rice pudding underscores the very meaning of life.",
