    "introduction": "A pig grows up in a \"normal\" way: gets basic education, does basic job, finds another heterosexual \"normal\" pig, raises little pigs up and asks children to duplicate own's life ... The pig lives a \"normal\" life just as the society required. But obedient pig is destined to be other's meal. The powerful class's pigs are greedy and difficult to be satisfied. They just kill a \"normal\" pig for wasting. Unluckily, they have abundant resources. Only if ordinary pigs keep living \"a normal life\".",
