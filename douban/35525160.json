    "introduction": "The Last Election is a documentary, a podcast, and a flash ethnography about the United States on election day 2020. The framing story follows amateur podcaster Khadim Diop in the creation of his podcast titled “The Last Election”. As finalists in a podcast competition, Khadim and his creative partner, Xisko Monroe, create a podcast/audio ethnography about election day 2020. They record interviews and observations from the streets of Times Square from sunrise November 3, 2020, to sunrise November 4, 2020. Their podcast centres on three primary questions they ask every interviewee. Conflict arises between the podcasters when Xisko’s sister shows up to help and Khadim’s personal political choices are challenged.",
