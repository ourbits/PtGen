    "introduction": "Tonic in traditional Western music is the root note of a key, and dominant is the fifth note of a scale. The tension between these two has often been exploited by composers in the sonata form. The film is basically a metaphor for music creation. The film chronicles three days in the life of a young musician and the three days correspond to the three movements of a classical sonata, each one containing its inner structure of dramatic development and the sum of the three leading to a final conclusion. On the first day the protagonist endures loneliness and fragility. On the second day what was to be a pleasant encounter becomes a nightmare. On the third day the young protagonist finally finds peace through music. Being a film about music, there is almost no dialogue and the story is mainly narrated through the integration of image and music.http://www.mnemocine.com.br/cinema/crit/tonicakatiacoelho.htm",
