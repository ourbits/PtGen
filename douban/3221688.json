    "introduction": "一部讲述1992年委国军事政变的片，当年的参与者就有现在的委国总统查维兹，绝对是一牛人。。。The film follows the events of the night of February 4, 1992 in Caracas, Venezuela. That night a group of military rebels staged a coup d'etat. Venezuelans found themselves as virtual prisoners. As the coup starts and fighting takes place from a military base which is in the center of the city's most affluent areas, with both luxury high rises and palatial mansions. The area of La Carlota provides a wealth of very interesting, often flamboyant and typical characters of the Latin America upper middle and upper classes. They are among the most affected. Various vignettes in these different characters' homes are developed. These people's reactions, lifestyles, vices, and humanity come out in a very honest fashion under duress. There are often clashes between them and the military invading the area. The media, particularly TV and radio insist everything is under control, but the residents around La Carlota see a very different reality, right through daybreak (Amanecer) the following morning.The movie basically shows the events of February 4th, 1992, where a group of venezuelan military did an unfinished Coup d' Etat against right wing government of Carlos Andrés Pérez. Coup was leaded by the current President of Venezuela, Commander Hugo Chávez, from the Parachuters Army.",
