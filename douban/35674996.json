    "introduction": "66 North Precinct is a character-led procedural crime series set in Lapland, the world's largest police precinct. The protagonist Det Inspector Maria Pudas is an ex world champion boxer who with the help of her partner Samu solve crimes all over this unforgiving yet beautiful Nordic landscape. Each week they solve a crime which is based on a true crime story from the region many of which are quite absurd. Maria loves her family and takes joy in playing pranks on her wife and children every day. Humour is her way of balancing her tough, exhausting job. Despite the dark crimes Maria investigates, the series is optimistic and warm. Each episode of the series focuses on one case that will be solved during the episode. Rovaniemi is the home of Ounasvaara ski center, Santa Land and the Arctic Circle. The attractions bring a lot of tourists from Finland and abroad and make Rovaniemi an international city. Rovaniemi is a mix of tourist centre, lively university town and exotic wild North. A place where different worlds and human stories meet.",
