    "introduction": "In a Tehran youth detention centre, detainees have the right to short furloughs, as long as their family provides sufficient bail to guarantee their return. The detention centre’s governor decides to help those without family to take advantage of this right. He asks them to swear on the Quran that they will return to the centre once their period of leave expires. Emkan, detained for two years, refuses this arrangement. The following day, the governor asks him to merely give his word to return. Once out, Emkan contacts his friend, Kaveh, who works for a small theatre in an industrial town. Will Emkan keep his word?",
