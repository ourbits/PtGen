During an afternoon of talk, Jesse discovers that Hank has been spending time with Bonnie, their young, bovine neighbor. Jesse is hurt and furious, and Hank is defensive, claiming that the baby has pushed him out. While Hank is elsewhere, the other woman pays a surprise visit to Jesse. Healing begins, and when Jesse's labor starts, it's Bonnie who comes to the rescue.",
