Whilst Christina (Jean Painter) is waiting for a bus on a deserted country lane she answers the ringing telephone in the public callbox. Although it is a wrong number she begins to chat with the charming stranger and is attracted to his seductive voice. Imagining a romantic, schoolgirl schoolgirl dalliance, Christina calls herself Samantha and arranges for the man to call her at the callbox the next night. Scared for her safety, Christina s parents forbid her and her younger sister to go out alone at night whilst the murderer is still at large. But Christina continues her dalliances with her romantic stranger and arranges to meet him on a dark and lonely night at the callbox",
