    "introduction": "Kate Adie examines the impact of women's work on the Home Front during the First World War. Innovations included the first women's police force, women's football and female surgeons operating on men. Adie argues that what truly mattered though was whether these changes in women's lives were long-lasting or viewed as 'only for the duration'.",
