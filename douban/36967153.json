    "introduction": "A middle-aged man builds a mobile religious shrine to make money in this darkly funny and moving exploration of consequences.Confronted by the success of this get-rich-quick scheme, a crisis of conscience forces our hero into a spiral of remorse and self-examination.Deceptively simple and superbly acted, this elegantly subversive film doubles as an intriguing window into the diasporic Iranian community in Montreal.",
