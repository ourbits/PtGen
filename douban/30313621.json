They all come from different walks of life, carrying their own baggage of what they are. Each one is in a hurry to reach their respective destinations. The journey does not quite end as they expect it to. It provokes some questions that were hidden deep within. Highway is a film of that escape which all of us yearn for. It is an attempt to see our own reflections in today's time.",
