    "introduction": "A stone falls from the sky in a mountain village. Two friends set out to find it in the countryside. On the way they talk, remember a deceased friend, laugh, discuss, meet other seekers. On the way, poetry is read, poetry is heard, poetry is felt in the wind. From the beginning of the day until the light goes out. One or more goodbyes, but also encounters and promises. A film about friendships, winter landscapes and something as useless and necessary as poetry.",
