    "introduction": "All Alvy wants is to wish his son a happy birthday. But every time he calls his ex wife's house, his son is strangely occupied. So Alvy tends to the rides and patrons at the Fun City amusement park, adrift in a sea of wonder and joy that he can't relate to. When a little boy is found unconscious, Alvy seizes the chance to exercise his fatherly duty. But the experience forces him to take stock of his hollow situation. And, after an unexpected altercation with a young co-worker, Alvy's realizes that his bare anger cannot bring about a better parenting scenario. But a changed perspective can.
