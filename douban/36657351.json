    "introduction": "In Scooter LaForge: a life of art, the iconic queer artist reflects on his career, his struggles and triumphs, and the impact that current events have had on his life and the lives of so many artists in NYC. Originally from New Mexico, LaForge exhibits a signature style that is instantly recognizable, yet perpetually reinvented. His bespoke painted clothing, which claimed the attention and subsequent partnership of famed designer Patricia Field, has become a specialized luxury, sought after by celebrities such as Debbie Harry, Beyoncé, and Nicki Minaj. Layered with childhood fantasy and adult themes, classical inspiration and modern social commentary, his pieces are woven together using paint, found objects, fabric, and anything else that strikes his fancy.",
