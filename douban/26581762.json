    "introduction": "Film critic and historian Alexander Pozdnyakov offers an intimate portrait of his subject, filmmaker Aleksei Guerman, in this revealing documentary, made on the occasion of Guerman’s 70th birthday. Explaining himself and his films in a series of rare, candid interviews, Guerman takes us on a journey through his childhood (a formative influence on his movies), his early days in the Soviet film industry, and his legendary battles with state censors that resulted in the banning of Trial On the Road and the suppression of multiple other works. Along the way, there are tantalizing glimpses of the master director at work on the set and in the editing room of his latest production, the decade-in-the-making sci-fi epic History of the Arkanar Massacre. U.S. Premiere!",
