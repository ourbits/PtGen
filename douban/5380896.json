    "introduction": "While cleaning her apartment, a young woman makes a surprising discover - a tiny clone of her lives under the bed in a matchbox. Bewildered, she throws the box and its inhabitant away, but the small houseguest is persistent.Director Jung Yumi makes everyday sounds – the creaking of floorboards, the humming noise from the fridge – the driving force of the narrative. Combined with delicate black-and-white animation, DUST KID becomes a deeply reflective piece, tracing the marks left behind by an anonymous and unremarkable life.",
