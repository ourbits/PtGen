    "introduction": "The third part of a six-part omnibus, the film is set in an alienated city ruled by merciless principles of corporate society in which a young woman consents to be reduced to mere human flesh, as it is the only ticket to the game of survival. Her mother encourages her to embark on this merciless world, although she knows that her child will be irreversibly damaged. Both women play a silent game to achieve the main goal (i.e. solve existential problems) but they are aware that the aftermath is more than the present.",
