    "introduction": "Narrated by Academy Award winning actor, Morgan Freeman, Where the Water Meets the Sky tells the inspiring story of a group of women from a remote town in northern Zambia who are given a unique opportunity: To learn how to make a film, on a subject of their choosing. In one of poorest regions of the country, where women rarely have the chance to speak out, a courageous group of twenty-three women produce a film about an issue that has affected them all, but few will discuss: the plight of young women, orphaned by AIDS. Inspired by the strength of Penelop, a young woman who agrees to share her story on film, the group becomes a force for change, showing how a single story can unite an entire community.",
