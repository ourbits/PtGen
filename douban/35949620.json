    "introduction": "Sandhya, a young twenty-something woman of Indian heritage who grew up sharing a love of Bollywood movies with her very traditional mum. As a modern woman who's nevertheless drawn in by the windswept blood-red saris, kohl-lined gazes, beautiful characters (and most of all, by the drama, emotion, and romance of Bollywood), Sandhya has spent her life waiting for the real world to live up to her celluloid-inspired fantasies. Then, something unexpected happens: COVID-19 puts the break on her aspirations, and Sandhya returns home to help her sick mum. She then discovers that her life and dreams have merged to become the plot of a crazy Bollywood film.",
