    "introduction": "Contrary to popular belief, this snake does not live in a wicker basket and its major prey is not the mesmerized tourist watching its hypnotic dance. This deadly serpent packs enough venom to bring down a bull elephant. From National Geographic, this documentary tracks the lethal King Cobra and its quest for survival within its natural habitat of the Indian rain forest. Highlights include rival males performing a ritualized dance for domination and a potential mate plus rare footage of a mother shielding her nest from harmful predators and a turbulent monsoon.",
