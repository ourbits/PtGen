    "introduction": "AN EPIC POEM explores the contradictions in man's conception of love through the myths and representations. Central to the film is the 'Rokeby Venus', slashed by militant suffragette Mary Richardson. It becomes an entry to the 'historic' past but also to myth and the unconscious, its imagery developed and shifted in a series of tableau-like encounters between Aphrodite and Ares.",
