Uncle Müşfik, who lives in a large mansion, joins the invitation of his friends one evening, causing unexpected events to develop. Behçet and Riko, who are planning to enter Mushfik's house, start to implement his plans with his leaving the house. The thieves think that nobody is home, but there is something very important they don't know. Müşfik entrusted the mansion to the puppets on his way home. Puppets, who see thieves entering the house, start defending the house against thieves. Surprised by what they would do when suddenly they saw live puppets, Behçet and Riko thought that puppets would cost more and decided to kidnap them. But it won't be as easy as they think.",
