    "introduction": "A very interesting film depicting the life of three teens in Switzerland, and the penalties of non-conformance. The young actors perform admirably and the film is a must see.....Particularly good was the performance from Natalie Spinell, a young German actress who portrays the love interest of the other two teen actors.The three protagonists resort to unorthodox methods to further their academic careers after messing up in school. Including theft, drug dealing at a techno parade, and sexual blackmail.This movie may not be suitable for American audiences due to the love triangle of the teens, and brief nudity, but never the less it is an excellent movie.",
