    "introduction": "Camille, a young woman with Down’s syndrome, dreams of joining a semi-professional dance company. Driven by unwavering determination, she has spent months rehearsing her choreography, fuelled by the hope of being accepted into the troupe. On the day of the audition, Camille arrives with her confidence fully intact, never imagining that her difference might be perceived as an obstacle. She courageously faces the condescending gaze of the jury. Her sister Agathe has reluctantly accompanied her, having had to put her own plans on hold for the day. But when she witnesses the subtle discrimination Camille is subjected to, Agathe’s anger rises and her instinct to protect takes over.",
