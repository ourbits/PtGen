    "introduction": "Andrey, the coach of the Severe Tigers children's hockey team in a small provincial town, gives his all to his pupils. The dimensional life of a man is disturbed by the news that the only ice palace in the city is going to be demolished and a shopping center built. Andrey is given a chance to \"compete\" for the Ice Palace by taking part in an adult amateur hockey tournament. Now he has only a few months to assemble his hockey team and prepare it for the most important tournament. The fathers of little hockey players, having learned about the recruitment to the team, decide to go on the ice themselves and fight for the future of their children.",
