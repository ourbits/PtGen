Moving to Estepona, Málaga (Andalusia, south to Spain) Makey meets not only his new superior, Comisaría Bonet, but Willy, a former CEO fallen on disgrace turned in bon vivant and scrounger who lives permanently stoned. Unfamiliar with the high technology and new police methods, Makey feels like an alien lost on Earth, specially with Lola, his twenty-something and resented daughter who works on Estepona as tour guide. When by chance Makey arrests a dangerous Russian mobster named Kolya wanted by Europol, the news opens an opportunity to reconcile father and daughter, and a communicate to reward Makey with a medal from Russia.
