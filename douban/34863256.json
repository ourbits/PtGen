    "introduction": "With animations, never-before-seen archival footage and soul-raising music, “Flannery” illustrates the biography of the brilliant, young writer from Georgia, U.S.A.  Flannery O’Connor’s story is brought to life with Mary Steenburgen’s voice and through the eyes of Alice Walker, Tommy Lee Jones, Mary Karr, Tobias Wolff, Alice McDermott, Conan O’Brien, Mary Gordon and many more.  These artists share their insights about O’Connor’s violent, redemptive work, while musicians—Lucinda Williams and Bruce Springsteen—share their Flannery-inspired music in this feature-length, NEH-funded film.",
