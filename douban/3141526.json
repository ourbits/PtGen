    "introduction": "Catholicism entered Korea in 1784. Lee Seung-hun spreads the words with the brothers of Jung Yak-jong and Jung Yak-yong. The religion is used as an impetus for dispute between political parties so it becomes persecuted. During the Sin-yu Persecution, Ha-sang and Jung-eun avoid torture and surveillance and gather the parishioners, expanding the church's power. Lee Hang-ju, the illegitimate child of Lee Ji-yeon a high ranking official, rescues Jung-eun from danger and is drawn to her at first glance. Hang-ju and Jung-eun's fathers give their blessing to their marriage but one is executed for truth and the other becomes a high ranking official whom no one can approach. Jung-eun avoids Hang-ju's love for the truth and the teachings of the church. Hang-ju desperately chases after his love. When many parishioners disappear like dew on the gallows during the Roman Catholic persecution, Hang-ju receives the Holy Spirit.",
