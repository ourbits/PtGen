Despite insisting the accusations are false, Gamel is chained, hooded, and sent on a cargo plane to Guantanamo Bay. John Anderson, a military interrogator, is brought out of retirement and assigned to Gamel's case. Despite relentless beatings, starvation, and torture, Gamel maintains he has no affiliation with al-Qaeda. John struggles with the mandate to force a confession at any cost. As Gamel prepares for a hearing on his status as an enemy combatant, he realizes he could be held indefinitely, and that John's testimony will be the deciding factor.",
