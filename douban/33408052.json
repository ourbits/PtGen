    "introduction": "At the end of the nineteenth century, a period dominated by oligarchies and the Church, young Camilla (Manuela do Monte) is forced to marry a wealthy farmer to rescue her family's social position. But on her wedding night, her husband learns that she is not a virgin.Furious, he keeps her prisoner in his house, watched over by his companion, and allowed to receive visits from only the local priest and sacristan, pending the annulment of the marriage. From there, she engages in a love triangle that questions the relationship between faith and reason. (Translated from Wikipedia)",
