    "introduction": "Suffering from severe food allergies, Cora leaves everything behind to join a spiritual community that no longer feels hunger. After her short film The Horses (National Competition, FNC 2021), the director has made an atmospheric debut feature that immerses us in an eery, unsettling world filled with strange rituals. Through its heroine, the film explores the little-known concept of 'inedia'—the ability of a person to live without consuming food—alongside themes of desire for escape, pain, and grief, all within a halo of strangeness and ethereal poetry, enhanced by the grain of 16mm film.",
