    "introduction": "Everything’s quiet when you’re in the water. No one can hear you. You don’t have to speak. You don’t even have to breathe. Dimitri, a 23-year-old swimmer, knows too well the liberating isolation of the water and frequently dives to the bottom of a pool to let his thoughts and memories surface. His relationship with Elsa keeps coming back to him and, as Dimitri moves between the past and the present, he remembers details, like the swimming lessons he gave Elsa, or her activism towards saving the dolphins. Her disappearance throws Dimitri’s disciplined life off balance and becomes the starting point for the unfolding of a story about memory, personal and collective responsibility, lost opportunities and love.",
