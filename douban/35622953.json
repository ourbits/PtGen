    "introduction": "The Conversation is the second feature film of Director Kim Dukjoong, who received critical praise for his film, The Education, which was invited to the New Currents at the Busan International Film Festival in 2019. His second feature offers a more sophisticated examination of the contemporary culture of everyday life. The Conversation focuses on Eunyoung and Seungjin, and their interactions with the characters who surround them. Conversations center on seemingly insignificant subjects and are spoken in everyday language and rhythm. Topics include such subjects as the characters′ memories or youth, love, and culture. Splendid acting, rhythmical dialogues, beautiful compositions, expanded tension in and out of the frame, and tensions between scenes create a sense of formal harmony. Rather than persuading viewers of the importance of life with linear narratives, The Conversation calls for the audience′s imaginative narratives of life to work by non-linearly collecting and placing precious pieces of everyday life. Its emotional echo and wavelength are great. (JUNG Hanseok)",
