    "introduction": "In 2011, a year after his death, famously provocative German director Christoph Schlingensief received the Golden Lion at the Biennale Venezia for his legacy in art. Little did they know to what extremes he would go in unleashing his unique \"social plastics\", interactive challenging test areas, where audiences and actors are likewise dipped into an inspiring chaos. This Doc Miniature shows him staging a play by nobel prize winner Elfriede Jelinek at Burgtheatre Vienna and Schauspielhaus Zürich, going over the edge by continuing the rehearsals despite a nervous breakdown and leaving behind stunned stars like Udo KIer, Irm Hermann and Peter Kern. Austrian Director Paul Poet was already Schlingensiefs partner in crime for the well-known Big Brother for asylum seekers-event at Wiener Festwochen 2000, chronicled in the Cinema Doc \"Foreigners out. Schlingensiefs Container\" (2002). Poet had started a second movie with Schlingensief, that never got finished, and only released material now.",
