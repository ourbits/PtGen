    "introduction": "Bill Nighy narrates this fascinating look at one of the greatest and most popular museums in the world – the Natural History Museum, London. We meet the teams keeping it up and running and the scientists working behind the scenes uncovering incredible discoveries about our natural world; from billion-year-old meteorites and dinosaur fossils from Antarctica to the wildlife in the Museum’s own garden. They’re on a mission to save our planet and travel the world from Morocco to Scotland and even the banks of the Thames to learn more about the natural world in all its glory.Narrator: Bill NighyProduction: [The Garden](https://www.thegarden.tv/productions/natural-history-museum-world-of-wonder)",
