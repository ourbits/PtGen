    "introduction": "Bizimina combines documentary cinema with dance. Through a series of independent pieces, it composes a story around the emotions we find it so difficult to express these days: distance, longing for others, desire, the community spirit, impotence, isolation, confusion, hope. The choreography builds a tale serving to provide comfort and company in this uncertain time.",
