    "introduction": "Examines the history of the Etruscans and the mysteries surrounding their origin. In the 7th and 6th centuries BC, they controlled much of the Italian peninsula, living in walled city-states set on hilltops. Their language is still only partly understood. Their art shows influences of Eastern Mediterranean and Greek culture, but the style is uniquely their own. Although most of their works of art were created for funeral purposes, they display great strength and vitality. The Etruscans founded Rome, introduced the alphabet to Italy and were the first to develop gladiatorial combat and chariot racing.",
