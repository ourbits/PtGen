    "introduction": "Life follows its own rhythm in boundless mountains, but a broken heart hurts as much there as in any other corner of the world. Abel, who is 17, does not expect his girlfriend to tell him that they should stop talking to each other. He will receive support from the least expected direction. The loss will become a pretext to rebuild an equally strong and important human bond, that between a son and a father, a child and a parent. Director Dekel Berenson returns to Krakow. His film ‘Ashmin’ won the Silver Dragon for the ‘accurate analysis of contemporary social contrasts’, his sensitivity, heart and authenticity. ‘Abel’ fulfils these criteria, too. The artist captures the concerns of his protagonists and allows the viewers to discover themselves in their emotions. This cinema attracts the audience with its honesty and a documentary-like power of observation.",
