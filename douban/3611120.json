    "introduction": "Yakuza eiga may be, in fact, a TV documentary movie about, obviously, the yakuza films. And it may be even possible that its format \"gender legend interviewed at some hip location + footage\" rubs the classicism bumpers. But when we activate the half cowboy – half samurai (and totally cool) vibe, a yakuza’s only vibe for a long time in the history of film now, Yakuza eiga is the perfect dreamed toy store. Or the dreamed shelf for whomever, by means of the virtual mafia, has his retina tattooed with one of the most adrenaline providers and vital genres of the past 40 years. It's just that the movie features every action figure that ever brought life to the few-words and many-beatings Japanese: Takeshi Kitano, Sonny Chiba, Takashi Miike, Sadao Yamane, and –standing ovation– the very Saint Movie’s Yakuza, Kinji Fukasaku! The list goes on and on, and becomes the perfect red carpet for a luxurious guest: a real yakuza, capable of sustaining \"What you’re showing in the movies is nothing.\" And, get ready, is responsible for making extremely clear WHY it is nothing. Cry, movie yakuzas, cry.",
