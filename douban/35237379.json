    "introduction": "When James Lawrence (aka the Iron Cowboy) announced his plan to complete 50 Ironman distances in 50 consecutive days in all 50 states, the only person who believed that he could pull it off was James himself. An Iron Man distance consists of a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride, and a 26.2-mile run. completing one race is considered a lifetime achievement. With the support of his wife, Sunny, and their five children in tow, Lawrence pushes himself to the point of breaking. This is an unbelievable mental and physical journey that redefines the limits of what is humanly possible.",
