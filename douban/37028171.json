    "introduction": "Landscape Drifting is a work by directors Hwang Da-eun and Park Hong-yeol, who vividly captured the struggles of the Seongmisan village community in The Teachers: Pink, Nature Trail, Ridge Between Rice Paddies, Plum (2023). This film marks another path for the directors as it documents the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the time of social distancing, the two directors and painter Park Se-jin held a modest exhibition with strictly limited visitors attending. Their small but well-lit studio became the exhibition hall, and two cameras placed in the corners of the space became the eyes of the directors, capturing the exhibition’s scenery. The film shows, with a slow and deliberate pace, the fluid movements of visitors, objects swaying in the wind, and the sunlight streaming through windows to create a dance of light on the paintings. It sensitively evokes the landscape of the time we experienced and becomes a passage of memory that should not be forgotten.",
