    "introduction": "The series tells the story of food vendors at 128 Circle food centre and their customers. They come from various ethnic backgrounds and reflect Singapore's passion for food.[3]A drama unique to Singapore`s multiracial fabric, *128 Circle* is the nation’s first multilingual television drama, following the lives of a group of hawkers (street food sellers) in the fictional 128 Circle Food Centre. Season 1 saw the introduction of the hawkers as they faced their own personal challenges and collectively, the looming closure of their beloved hawker centre. In Season 2, the hawkers weather not only the storms of a global pandemic that spares no one; they must also contend with ups and downs of family, friendship and life in Singapore. Season 3 follows the hawkers struggling with rising costs, personal issues and a group of newer, younger hawkers brought in to refresh the hawker centre.",
