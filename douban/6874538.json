    "introduction": "In a gripping psychological thriller, Sam Carter is a wild-card detective with rage in his heart; he drinks too much and his drive to catch the bad guys often runs afoul of the law. Una, his sister, is lovely and determined, though somewhat lost; she runs a nonprofit clinic in Brooklyn and is the neighborhood savior for many homeless teens and poverty-stricken families. Gabriel Kessler teaches philosophy at the university with a dark zeal and startling intensity his students have never experienced. Damaris comes off as a Puerto Rican hard ass, but complex issues hide beneath her tough exterior. When a group of snuff porn kingpins go on trial, the characters are brought together with more in common than they ever could have imagined. As deadly secrets surface, a terrifying five-day killing spree erupts and no one knows who is responsible. Sam and his partner, Joey, must track a brutal killer in an adrenaline-fueled, edge-of-your-seat race to a mind-blowing conclusion. Written by Amy Williams",
