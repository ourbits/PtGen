    "introduction": "Vintage \"Clavillazo\" comedy. I recently came across this movie through a relative that recorded it from a TV channel that was showing Mexican classics. I liked it so much that I had to borrow it again after I returned it (and have yet to return it). There is a scene that just about mesmerizes me, and that is the scene where the legendary Pedro Vargas sings \"La muchacha de mis suenos\" (the girl of my dreams), while dancing accompanied by someone I was unacquainted with-Mary Lopez). This Mary Lopez is just beyond cute. I probably drool while watching her. She really is the stuff of dreams. Pedro Vargas' commanding voice with the catchy tune makes this scene unforgettable. All of this not to even mention our hero \"Clavillazo.\" This guy cracks me up. I love his acting style--totally outlandish and affected. I used to watch his movies as a kid, and now I get to see him again after all this years, and I still like him. (Possible spoilers)The plot is simple but interesting, with Clavillazo being used as a Guinea pig with a research drug that makes him dream the future, and that is what sets the train of events in motion.",
