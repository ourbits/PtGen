His gorgeous 17 year old pupil, who already harbours desires for him, moves in for the kill – at first metaphorically, and when the teacher refuses her advances literally. If grieving for his loss wasn't enough to keep him occupied his secret admirer trumps up a false rape charge tries to run him over in a car and plays her hand at blackmail. The Perfect Teacher is an engrossing take on obsession..When 17-year-old Devon (Megan Park) falls in love with her attractive new math teacher Jim (David Charvet), she'll stop at nothing, including murder to make sure they end up together. Ingratiating herself with his daughter Annique (Keeva Lynk) and making sure his current girlfriend Rachel (Boti Bliss) and ex-wife Marissa (Judith Baribeau) are out of the way, Devon's obsession takes a deadly toll on Jim's life.",
