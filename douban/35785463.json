    "introduction": "In a gritty and gloomy village, detective Enzo Vitello becomes increasingly obsessed with tracking down the serial killer “Dostoyevsky”. The killer has a habit of leaving letters next to his victims’ bodies in which he describes their last moments. Seduced by the murderer’s nihilistic notes, and driven by his own inner demons, Vitello embarks on a correspondence with Dostoyevsky outside the knowledge of his investigative team. This exchange drives Vitello into the darker corners of his soul and forces him to confront a secret from his past – a secret that led him to abandon his daughter Ambra when she was a toddler. Vitello penetrates deep into the murderer’s head, but also opens the doors to his own thoughts and emotions. A gruelling game of cat and mouse develops.",
