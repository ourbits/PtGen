    "introduction": "In the Middle Ages, strange trials and surrealistic executions took place before courts and crowds. The convicted parties were not people, but pigs, insects, roosters. Bambitchell, the creative duo of Sharlene Bamboat and Alexis Mitchell, looks into this curious use of the rites of justice. Gradually, the film transforms: images are altered, the music disrupts the historical review, while cruel injustices against animals take on a new dimension, revealing a monstrous reflection of human justice and institutionalized discrimination. The fantastical essay has a distinct political flavour as it looks to the past to shed light on the present.",
