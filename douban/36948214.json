    "introduction": "The researchers and the astronaut figure appear again, if briefly, in Cao Fei's newvideo MatryoshkaVerse (2022), in which she captures documentary footage of theincredible border city of Manzhouli in Inner Mongolia. A blend of Chinese and Russianinfluences, which are visible in giant Matryoshka-doll buildings and amusement parks,Manzhouli and its surrounding landscape become the ground for a metaphysicalexploration into multinationalism, cultural hybridity and the complex ways in whichhuman history continues to imprint itself onto the earth. A utopia of a very differentsort, MatryoshkaVerse, like all of Cao Fei's projects on view, reflects upon the rapidchanges brought about by global developments, both in China and throughout theworld, as well as the points that connect us across these divides",
