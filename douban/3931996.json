    "introduction": "Executed with Disney-like animation by one of Soyuzmultfilm’s leading directors of films for children. “Plus Electrification” triumphs the USSR’s drive to bring lectricity to every town and village.  It was a tenet of Vladimir Lenin that electrification plus oviet power [vlast] would lead to Communism.  Electricity is shown dramatically uniting the economies of USSR and the Eastern bloc countries through production of consumer goods like Czech crystal and Hungarian buses.",
