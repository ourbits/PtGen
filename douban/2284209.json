    "introduction": "Stories about war usually deal with the atrocities of battle, or with heroism and companionship. In this film, another aspect of the phenomenon is laid bare: the attraction of legitimate destruction. Vietnam veterans tell about their experiences and traumas, but also about their triumphs. One of them admits that he has done terrible things, but he still longs to get back to the killing. Another man compares fighting to a rush that is better than any drug. The central figure of this film is the former war correspondent and scriptwriter Michael Herr (FULL METAL JACKET), who has written a bestseller about the allure of war, entitled Dispatches. He puts into words the unbearable reality of the things that we humans are capable of and can even enjoy, raising the alarming question: is there a murderer lurking inside each of us?",
