    "introduction": "A surrealistic adventure through dreamscape and life. Finally, tempered surrealism hits the screen. Unlike early works from the 30s, this film delivers a moderated flow of strangeness which is used to accentuate the director's vision. While at times some events and characters may seem gratuitously inserted, almost without exception they resolve their merits.There are some scenes which are beautiful in a more classic way, and the director's mastery of the film medium is very evident. The acting is very compelling, and at times, I felt a strong urge (or perhaps a connection) to act as did the protagonist, and I felt like something was pulling me into the film itself, feeling its emotions, and thinking as did its characters speak, which is very appropriate for this film.Shot in digital video, this surreal, metaphysical meditation on existence and identity finds a man (Pasta Dioguardi) and a woman (Flor Sabatella) trapped in an apparent dream taking place in the labyrinthine corridors and strange rooms of a seaside 1930s hotel. The man knows nothing about his past or how he ended up in the hotel, but is accused by two men of having committed a crime at some previous point in his life. Every time he falls asleep, the man is tortured by a recurring nightmare of living in an impoverished apartment with a woman and a baby. Gradually, the man and woman fall in love as they try to figure out what has led to their imprisonment, and together they resort to extreme measures to break out of the dream. The dream takes on even more sinister proportions when the couple realize that one of the hotel's bizarre inhabitants may in fact be dreaming them.",
