Finally, Arzuaga, with his Spanish surname, is not coincidentally an allusion to José María Arzuaga, the Spanish filmmaker whose avant-garde work brought elements of renovation with such productions as Raíces de piedra (Roots of Stone, 1963) and Pasado el meridiano (Beyond the Meridian, 1966), notably offering one of the first cinematic portrayals of Bogotá‘s urban changes in the 1960s.",
