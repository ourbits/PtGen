He attends a Beauty Contest sponsored by Vimal Fabrics, and is attracted to the Beauty Queen, Bharti Saxena. He meets her later and invites her to his yacht to celebrate her winning the title, as well as accompanies her on several modeling shoots. He goes to her residence one morning to show her the photographs taken on his yacht. The next day Ramesh is arrested by the police and charged with sexually assaulting Bharti. He hires a advocate named Chandra, and enters a plea of not guilty, stating that both had consensual sex. The Court hears the arguments as well as the testimony from none other than Bharti's sister, Neeta, and exonerates Ramesh. Two years later, Bharti is arrested by the police for killing Ramesh in cold blood. Watch as events unfold to show what compelled Bharti to kill Ramesh, and whether the Court will sentence her to death or life in prison.",
