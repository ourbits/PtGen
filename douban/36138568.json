    "introduction": "What did it mean to be Chinese in Black space during segregation? Following director Crystal Kwok's personal journey of discovery, she digs into how her grandmother's family navigated life as grocery store owners in the black neighborhood of Augusta, Georgia. The film weaves personal family stories with memories from the larger Chinese and Black communities, opening up uncomfortable but necessary conversations around anti-black racism and the deeply rooted structure of white power and Chinese patriarchy that contributed to this. Which fountain did the Chinese drink from? Where did they sit on the bus? An entrance into our connected histories we never knew oR dared speak about as told through the woman's lens.—Crystal Kwok",
