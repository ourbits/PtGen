    "introduction": "It is about freedom and captivity, about emancipation, acculturation and assimilation; it is about the roles played by Moses and Felix Mendelssohn in the dream of fruitful, unproblematic integration of the Jews into German society after their liberation from the ghettos; it is about Richard Wagner and his influence on the thinking of the Third Reich but, most of all, it is a DVD about how much music can mean to people particularly in the direst circumstances. The title is taken from a poem by a 12-year-old girl, Eva Pickova, written in the Theresienstadt concentration camp.",
