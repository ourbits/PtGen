    "introduction": "DISAPPEARED-- follows the unpredictable twists of missing person cases, tracking investigations aimed at solving how and why people simply vanish. While some of the resolutions are heartwarming and others tragic, many cases remain open to this day and continue to be a source of unbearable frustration for family members and friends. Each episode of DISAPPEARED begins from the time immediately before the individual vanished, searching for clues hidden beneath seemingly everyday behavior that may indicate whether or not the person left voluntarily. For the open cases that have gone cold, DISAPPEARED asks viewers to share fresh leads in hopes of deciphering what truly happened to the missing and whether foul play may have been involved.",
