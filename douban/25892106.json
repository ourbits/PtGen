    "introduction": "The world's first woman Rabbi lived in Berlin of the 1930s, and her greatest dream was to become a Rabbi. She felt that she was born to be a Rabbi, but women were barred from becoming a Rabbi according to the Jewish laws. I was deeply impressed by her short life story, which was full of struggles. But how can I tell her story, when there is one surviving photo of her and only a few letters? That was the challenge. Rachel Weisz as the inspiring figure Regina, makes this story complete. The use of archive and experimental editing technique adds a magical layer which pulls the audience into this unique story.",
