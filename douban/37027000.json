    "introduction": "The story follows Dexter after receiving good news about his status, two years into being a Person Living with HIV (PLHIV). He proceeds through his day like a normal queer person would do: get a new hairstyle, and fancy colorful cakes at a bakeshop. His day unfolds positively until he decides to show up at an eccentric friends' party, whom he has ghosted since his diagnosis. Dexter and his friends catch up, but not everyone is happy with his surprising return. Ian, his best friend, is offended by this comeback, questioning the decisions Dexter made. Little does lan know, all answers in that 2-year absence are enveloped in a piece of paper Dexter gives him.",
