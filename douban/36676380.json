    "introduction": "Former police major Georgiy Belonog lives as a hermit in a trailer on the shores of the Gulf of Finland. Five years ago, his father went missing, and the local prosecutor quickly closed the case and declared him dead. Later, Georgiy's beloved, without explaining the reason, suddenly breaks off relations with him and leaves for Moscow, while he himself closes in on himself. The only one with whom he can share his pain is his faithful dog Casper. Soon a new prosecutor arrives in the city with compromising evidence on the local authority.",
