    "introduction": "Rome, March 2020. One of the many anonymous nights during the lockdown. Suddenly Irene’s (Barbara Ronchi) phone starts ringing. It’s Pietro (Claudio Santamaria), her ex boyfriend. She hasn’t heard from him for months, since their breakup. She hesitates, but eventually she answers the phone. Pietro is out of his mind. His confused words foreshadow a desperate act. All Irene has to do is to set off, with a car, in a deserted city, without ever hanging up the phone, hoping to reach him in time.",
