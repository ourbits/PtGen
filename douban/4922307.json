    "introduction": "The five episodes from the life of a painter, George Kovásznai processing, which the film is devoid of inscriptions on the basis of several places of historical credibility. The domestic history of television is not very significant period of work produced TV movie deservedly forgotten, though Őze Louis Csontváry great shape because it is worth the viewing. In many parts of \"blue-box\" technique, the film shows a typical piece of the era tévéfilmjeinek. The episodes are as follows: A JOKE - Friends coffee house in his absence CSONTVÁRY evaluated in different ways, and then when it arrives, one with a bad taste pseudo-mock telephone call. Seeing the artist's transcendence shocked to betray the secret. THE CURSE - Csontváry rags in the streets to recruit passers-by to issue their own, or who are afraid of him, or considered to be difficult to understand the strange things people philosophized. A gentleman with rope and seeing the pictures, leave indignantly. Finally, a group of children comes into the room, but they laughed at the exhausted man, and he curses Csontváry a spoiled human society. The last scene of the painter stráfkocsin take your pictures of him with incompetent people in the city. The monologue - in 1919, the days of dictatorship of the proletariat in a nervous, but we see the office of the Deputy People's Commissar of the ill painter, who has not said a word during the scene. Half dead listening to the speech of Communist leaders, many of which quote we hear Csontváry earlier writings. Finally, collapses and shipped. The water - in a hospital and live theatrical dances pyramids, accompanied by the artist dies, his life will be among the dominant figures biography details, quotes. The last scenes of quotations from his writings and various visions of the disease comes to life. The auction - recalls the scene, in which images of a young architect, eventually there will be no courtesy kufárok prédáivá but salvaged for posterity.",
