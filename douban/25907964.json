    "introduction": "A cowboy from the United States is transported to the Pampas where he is instructed in the ways of his counterpart, the gaucho. First a change of outfits, then he meets his horse. There are misadventures with a lasso and a saddle. Traditional activities include the asado, or barbecue, using bolas to hunt ostrich, and singing and dancing traditional music around the campfire. After the narrator completes the instructive summary, our cowboy returns home to the Midwest.",
