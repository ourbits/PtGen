We gain an intimate glimpse into the creative and emotional life of Kate, Anton, and Keith. Young and carefree, the friends party, photograph, paint, sing, and play their way through the clubs and lofts of Alphabet City. The party ends in 1984 when Anton and Keith contract a mysterious illness known as the \"gay cancer.\" As her music career takes off, Kate tries to save her friends. With the cameras still rolling, we meet the parents, patrons, and patients that struggle against the epidemic.",
