    "introduction": "Evi and Vanessa, two 14-year-olds living in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, are best friends despite their opposing political beliefs. As nationwide disputes over public education explode into vitriol and division in their hometown, the girls and others in the community fight to discover the humanity in “the other side.”Remarkably important on a national level, Bucks is a swing county within a swing state that boasts a mix of suburbia, rural farmland, and industrial working-class folks. While division has always existed, a global pandemic expanded the nationwide culture war to a new frontier, landing in tight-knit communities and schools. As starkly opposing factions vie for control of the school boards and the policies they create, all in the name of protecting their children, the future generation is watching, listening, and absorbing it all. Through the youthful lens of Evi and Vanessa, can we learn that it’s possible to coexist and love one another despite our differing political views?",
