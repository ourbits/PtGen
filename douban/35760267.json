Both are workaholics who are extremely absorbed with their careers. They meet late one night in the hotel bar as James encourages Stacey to have a \"little\" fun and let loose. The night turns into a night of drinking, dancing and a one night stand. The morning reveals that they have several things in common. A perfect match made in heaven? Together forever? So it would seem, until they discover something that is quite shocking and disturbing about each other.",
