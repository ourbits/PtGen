    "introduction": "Qwerty is a film about lonely concepts of people and their quirky exploits. I use the term “concepts of people” to illustrate the type of picture that director Bill Sebastian and writer Juliet McDaniel attempt to construct. Zoe (Dana Pupkin) and Marty (Eric Hailey) are defined in broad strokes, providing the audience with two lead characters who haven’t much depth beyond their set of indie-inspired eccentricities. Much like the recently acclaimed Safety Not Guaranteed, the characters and construction of Qwerty fail to resonate as anything more than a hodgepodge of half-baked Sundance film festival pictures.",
