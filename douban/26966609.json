    "introduction": "身价净值超过600亿美元，沃伦•巴菲特是真正的独一无二的亿万富翁。这位传奇般的投资者仍旧住在他位于奥马哈的小房子里。今年86岁的他，每天都开车去到办公室管理世界第五大上市公司伯克希尔•哈撒韦公司。但比起他低调的生活方式，更令人惊讶的是他的道德情操。他庄重和正直的人格魅力让他累积了巨额财富，并在一次史上最大型的慈善活动中，捐出了所有财产。《成为沃伦•巴菲特》这部影片讲述了一个来自内布拉斯加洲的小男孩成为世界上最受人尊敬的男人之一的成长史，以及引导他的幕后贵人。影片为独家拍摄，包含沃伦•巴菲特从未曝光过的家庭影像，沃伦•巴菲特将带领大家思考，当金钱不再有意义时，什么才是最重要的？With a net worth of over $60,000,000,000, Warren Buffett is truly a one-of-a-kind billionaire. The legendary investor still lives in his modest home in Omaha. At 86 years old, he drives to the office every morning to manage Berkshire Hathaway, the fifth largest public company in the world. But more surprising than his humble lifestyle is his moral core. The same principles of decency and integrity that helped him pile up a fortune led him to give it all away in the largest philanthropic donation in history. Becoming Warren Buffett chronicles the evolution of a boy from Nebraska who became one of the most respected men in the world, and the heroes who helped guide him along the way. By allowing access to his life and never-before-released home videos, Buffett offers a glimpse into his unique mind to help us understand what is truly important when money no longer has meaning.",
