    "introduction": "The daters are hidden from the contestant on an RV which follows the contestant's van. The date begins with the contestant and one of the daters. At any point during the date, usually when things start to get boring, unpleasant or the dater has an attribute the contestant does not like, the contestant can next the dater and the dater becomes eliminated.At any point, the contestant can give the current dater a choice between a second date or taking the money they've earned for each minute the date has lasted. The date ends when all dates have been nexted or when a dater is given the choice between the money or a second date.It is not uncommon for the contestant to next a dater at first sight. On one episode, a contestant nexted the first four daters and asked the last dater for a second date within the first minute. Faced with the choice of either a date with the contestant she just met, or a dollar, the dater opted for the second date.Short comment clips from contestants and daters are shown throughout the show.from Wikipedia",
