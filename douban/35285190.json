    "introduction": "\"In 1972, as the war in Vietnam reached its violent peak, walls around Denmark bore the slogan, \"Vietnam - Denmark, Same Struggle\". In other words, Danish political life was dominated by the interests of the United States. Not unlike the situation in the Middle East.This film analyzes the economic interests underpinning the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, with a particular focus on the influence of international oil interests in the region. The analysis found here is inspired by the writings of the Palestinian writer and journalist Ghassan Kanafani.\"",
