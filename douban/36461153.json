The Tennessee-based Tornadoes, the most successful football team in Tennessee, has a total of 18 state titles, five of which were won in the last five years. Now the pressure is on to win their sixth state championship. But their new recruits are inexperienced, and the COVID-19 pandemic is wreaking havoc on the season.
