He then corrected his error the second time.Gwen Stefani performed the same dance moves as she did when she was featured earlier the week on American IdolThe \"detonator\", was actually just a Staples \"Easy Button\" with the word easy covered up on a shiny metallic box.When the smoke and slime were in effect, the cameras shook to imitate the effect of shaking, however when it switched cameras, the second camera was not shaking, and when it returned to the view of the first camera, the first camera was shaking again.The KCA 07 were said to be \"Twenty Minutes Longer.\" However, they were only ten minutes longer. Because of this, the SpongeBob Squarepants episode \"Waiting\" was shown to fill in the time slot.Almost all female awards were shown during commercials, while nearly all male awards were shown during the program.The TurboNick webcams on the orange carpet and inside the pavilion were delayed approximately 3 hours.The title belt that Justin Timberlake used while he was the Burping Champion was actually a replica of the WWE World Heavyweight Championship with stickers covering the plates.Justin Timberlake won the Favorite Male Singer award while also being the show's host.",
