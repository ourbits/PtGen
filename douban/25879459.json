    "introduction": "In the midst of a modern metropolis like New York, innumerable tormented souls wander the streets in agony, trapped by feelings of dejection and loneliness. They’ve been dumped! Meet Alley, rejected just four days ago. She can’t stop asking herself what went wrong while thinking about that trip to the Grand Canyon where they read poetry together at sunset. And meet Michael, a freelance translator who admits that no hour passes without thinking of his lost love, even though he no longer holds any hope. And Rosey, who fell madly in love after a single kiss with a stranger at the Mermaid Parade in Coney Island. We’ve all been there. Breakups hurt the ego, the body, the soul. But those are the rules of the game: the more you love, the more you suffer. Oscar-nominated Swiss director Christian Frei presents surprising evidence of what happens in our brains when we get rejected, as he chronicles the journeys of a few heartbroken souls. Juan Baquero",
