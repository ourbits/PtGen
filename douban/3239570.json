    "introduction": "a don't miss camp classicwas this really made in 1970? this film has the look + feel of a '50's B classic. i think ed wood jr. was still alive when this was released + he must have loved it. watching this film i keep hitting the cable guide to be sure it said 1970. i was watching dark shadows + vanishing point in that era. everyone was tuning in , turning on , + hating dick nixon. vietnam was raging + zepplin + sabbath ruled. to say this film doesnt fit that era is an oxymoron. this film belongs in another era . the 50's in all that tecnicolor glory. hansen is great in the dual role of george/christine. and that guy who plays the writer boyfriend is a riot, a swarmy george nader type. i guess nader was too old in 1970 for the part but he would have been great. this is a must see for all ed wood fans. glen or glenda has nothing on this classic. ed wood + jorgensen had so much in common + this story was the real break in eds woods career. if ed could have only made a film nearly this good.",
