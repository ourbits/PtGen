    "introduction": "In Hungary, more than 50 percent of all inmates end up back in prison within 5 years from their release. The tale therapy was launched in 2010 in the Heves County Remand Prison in Eger, and since its inception, more than 100 women have taken part in it. Out of them, only one went back to prison. The 26 minute-long animated documentary, which was the director's graduation film at the University of Theatre and Film Arts Budapest, introduces the tale therapy through a particular tale and everyday life of two imprisoned mother. We discover the prison life and also the desires and change in these two women through their stories and the tale. Even though they are locked up in prison, viewers can embrace their imagination and created worlds they utilize to get closer to their children's forgiveness",
