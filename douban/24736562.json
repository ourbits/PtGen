    "introduction": "Portrait of Andrzej Munk plotted memories of his friends and colleagues. The key to this essay is the prospect of the Auschwitz concentration camp, where he was held shooting for Passenger , Munk's last film. Crew Passenger not only worked, but spent the night in the camp. Work on the film was interrupted by the sudden death of Andrzej Munk in a car accident. Andrzej Brzozowski, who was then an assistant director, after years of going back to the camera to the Auschwitz concentration camp. As he admits in front of the camera, could do the movie only there. The dark interior of the camp and night exteriors are interspersed with scenes of the Passenger , archival photographs, as well as fragments of sensitive letters that Munk wrote to his wife, Joan, from different places. This film tells both the rough draft of the director, his working methods and way of being, and of the experience of working on the passenger , unless special for all members of the crew.",
