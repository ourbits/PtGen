    "introduction": "An actress, director and writer. Intense, sensual, eclectic. She began by interpreting existential angst and emptiness, and then she moved on to the films of the golden age of Italian comedy. Talking about Monica Vitti means telling the story of the evolution of Italian cinema. She was an actress \"physically\" at odds with the chesty pinups of her era, and yet she managed to transform her \"defects\" into an unique character",
