    "introduction": "Blackbone Tale is realized by Jeremy Clapin in collaboration with Spirit Productions, with the support of Centre de la Premiere Oeuvre (GOBELINS). It's a high result of mixing 2d and 3d: the characters are made in 3d cellshading and the remains in 2d.This silent mute is pure poetry.A man alone, with his peculiar physique: he has his head held low, looking down at the ground.Clapin needs only few minutes to show you the emotional state of this man: his loneliness and his quest for a human being like him. A profound analysis of alienation and frustation of people: man needs to live with other men.",
