    "introduction": "In the village of Great Pelfe Maureen Stubbs from the Midsomer Conservation Society is stabbed to death after openly accusing builder Geoff Rogers and councillor James Otley of conspiring to ruin the look of the village by rushing through a plan to build modern housing. Supporters of the plan are targeted by a burglar,who turns out to be David Walsh,a supporter of the Conservation Society who is standing against Otley in an upcoming election and claims that Maureen was killed because she was about to expose a conspiracy to build a super-market complex. Both Rogers and his architect,Clifford Bunting,are also murdered and Angela Lawrence,from the Conservation Society,admits that Rogers bribed her to discredit Maureen by staging underhand tactics. There is most definitely a scam being carried out behind the supposed housing development plan but is the murderer a supporter of the scam rubbing out all opposition or a dissenter,claiming Not in my Back Yard?",
