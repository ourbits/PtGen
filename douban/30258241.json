    "introduction": "RUTH is a film about the society of metropolitan Portugal and its African colonies of the beginning of the 1960’s. This is the story of a young Mozambican footballer called Eusébio, a gifted athlete destined to great achievements, coveted by a rival club, Benfica, which ends up hiring him. Blackmail, kidnapping attempts, ministers involved, press hysteria and huge money offers make the story of this football transfer into a saga evolving between the two continents. It ends up when the legend begins: with Eusébio’s first match at the Benfica Stadium.",
