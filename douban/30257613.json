    "introduction": "After receiving an invitation online, Jessie, Kailanni and Xander head off on a road trip to the biggest social media party of the year; \"Our Social Playground\". Sex, Drugs and Alcohol fuel the bikini-clad babes and muscled up guys, as they gather together, striving to achieve their socialite status, but Jessie isn't convinced as she struggles with the faux reality of social media. After running into some trouble with her obsessive ex-boyfriend Caleb; Jessie befriends Bodhi, a local with a troubled past that shares her views about social media; but as the night continues, Jessie and Bodhi soon realise that they share a lot more than just their views. As the night begins to wind down, Jessie and her friends are forced into a vicious game of cat and mouse, as a sadistic serial killer hunts them down and starts executing them one-by-one. Now, captured and beaten, Jessie finds herself in an old abandoned cabin where she is forced to confront her own tormented past, and she learns that not all debts are paid with money; some are paid in blood.",
