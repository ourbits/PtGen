    "introduction": "根据法国女作家乔治桑与钢琴家肖邦在西班牙马略卡岛上的故事拍摄的电影。1838-1839年他们曾经在岛上居住过一段时间并被美丽的风景所吸引，肖邦在那里完成了他的一些经典作品，而乔治桑也为他写了本小说。这个69年的西班牙版本应该是关于乔治桑与肖邦爱情拍得最好的片之一了，由1947年意大利小姐Lucia Bosé和英国演员Christopher Sandford主演。肖邦的音乐自然不用说，而影像也很出色，Luis Cuadrado当时就已开始显露出后来在《蜂房的精神》中的那种宁静优雅的摄影术了，能把马略卡岛的冬天拍得如此美丽迷人，大概也只有西班牙人了吧。：）The cigar-smoking French writer, George Sand (Lucia Bose) and her lover, the composer-pianist Chopin (Christopher Sandford) have rented a former monastery in Mallorca as a winter retreat. They have even shipped a piano to the site, so that Chopin can continue his work. However, what promised to be a warm, sunny vacation turns sour as the locals disapprove of Sand, the servants are surly and mysterious, and the monastery is cold. She has her revenge, however. She wrote the book A Winter in Mallorca about her miserable winter retreat. This film follows that book closely, with concern for historical accuracy, which did not increase the Spanish filmmakers' popularity with their countrymen. This is a Spanish language film, with no dubbing or subtitles.Spanish filmmaker Jaime Camino specialized in films about the Spanish Civil War. These include Espana Otra Vez/Spain Again (1968) and Las Largas Vacaciones del 36/The Long Holidays of '36 (1976). Before debuting as a director, Camino studied music and law and wrote film reviews in the mid-'60s. Camino made his feature-film debut with Los Felices 60/The Happy Sixties (1963).",
