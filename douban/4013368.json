    "introduction": "A look at never completed version of I, Claudius. This is a wonderful look at film making in the golden age, both as it was and as memory has made it. We get to see the stars and crew talk about a project that got away and how it still haunts them.This is one of the best films on films ever made, partly because it shows us what might have been a treasure, but also because it does what what movies do best, create an illusion of something that doesn't really exist. With a film like this, made decades after events, the mind is left to ponder what the aborted film might have been. From the few scraps of actual footage we expand it out to a completed film that might have been one of the greatest films of all time. Of course it all could have gone south as well, but the fun is in what might have been....10 out of 10A Personal request- would someone please put this out on DVD by itself, its stupid to make us buy the BBC miniseries just to be able to see this.",
