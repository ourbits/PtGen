    "introduction": "'The Hottest Day of the Year', by Keren Cytter, is a video in two chapters, which at first sight seem to have little to do with one another. The first part refers to the tradition of the romantic anthropological documentary. A male voice-over tells the life story of his imaginary grandmother, Anne-Marie Baptist, who moved to South Africa during the Second World War. She died of malaria in 1950, after a quest for the mythical place in Mozambique where the Khoikhoi and San (Bushmen) tribes fought against each other. A female voice-over in French quotes from Baptist's fictional travel diary.",
