    "introduction": "A former war photographer tries to ward off his personal ghosts by taking pictures of trees only. He lives alone among olive trees in southern Italy. One day he decides to cross the sea by ferry. Once in Albania, he goes near the location where he had made his last war picture, as if he was retracing his steps. He finds a tree he wants to photograph. He is just about to do so, when he discovers a runaway girl hiding in it. Her lover was killed by her brothers. So she ran away with the sole objective of crossing the sea and getting to the other side. The man has no choice. He has to flee with her, follow her, guide her along, and follow her again. Until the day he tells her what is tormenting him, and a storm separates them. All he has left of her is a fleeting impression of an image.",
