In the 1920s, Carl Schappeller claims to be able to develop a mechanism -a machine-by means of which a hitherto unexplored form of energy-the space energy-can be made available. He mobilizes a large following. The Catholic Church, the former German imperial family, the English navy and numerous private individuals are among his supporters, who support him with millions.",
