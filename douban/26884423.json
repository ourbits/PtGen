    "introduction": "Six strangers - fleeing hordes of much-feared, but never-glimpsed barbarians - seek refuge in the ancient home of a sorcerer and sorceress. After being promptly asked ti surrender their smartphones, the guests are treated to an alternately deadpan and philosophical odyssey involving magic, ghosts, painting, and an extended reenactment of an Arthurian romance as they confront their uniquely 21st-century insecurities and anxieties.Eugène Green developed En attendant les barbares in an actors’ workshop. A witty satire of the present days. Social networks announce the arrival of the barbarians and the only safe place is a medieval mansion where cell phones are left at the door.",
