    "introduction": "Thakur Jarnail Singh is known and feared in the region and has killed anyone who has dared to oppose him. He shoots down Champa's husband ruthlessly in front of her eyes, ignoring her pleas for mercy when the former refuses to provide ammunition and guns. He then shows up in full force during a wedding ceremony at the Zamindar's mansion and abducts a courtesan, Chamelijaan. Subsequently, he rescues her from his henchman, Thakur Kripal Singh, and with her consent, marries her in the presence of Pandit Ram Avtar and Maulana Sheikh Rahim. Shortly thereafter she becomes pregnant and gives birth to a boy who they name Sheru. With the child growing up, the Superintendent of Police hot on his tail, the trio go on the run and separate. A traumatized Chamelijaan must decide about their future when she not only goes to live in the same village as Champa - but watches her son learn to ride horses and take up firearms.",
