    "introduction": "The debut feature from Paraguayan director Pablo Lamar is an exercise in cinema stripped back to its barest bones. Through long, slow, static shots, with no dialogue at all, Lamar tells his story with images and precisely sculpted sound (it comes as no surprise to learn that he works as a sound designer on other films). Meditative and uncompromisingly austere: this is filmmaking that pushes the boundaries of cinema to a place where none but the most stalwart advocates of slow cinema will have the inclination to follow.",
