He explores why a person who seemingly has it all, can still suffer from debilitating panic attacks in the hope that he can learn how to finally break free from his crippling anxiety. On a worldwide journey, from the streets of New York, to the stillness of the Ganges, and deep into the jungles of Peru, he unexpectedly uncovers deep truths about who and what he is.",
