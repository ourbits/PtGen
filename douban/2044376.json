    "introduction": "A young mother struggling to raise her baby daughter finds the weight of responsibility bearing down on her shoulders in director Henner Winckler's heartfelt tale of love and maturity. Maggy is an eighteen-year old girl who, after giving birth to a baby girl named Lucy, was forced to grow up before her time. Thankfully for Maggy, her mother is always willing to help take care of young Lucy. Though Maggy still lives at home with her mother, it's obvious that the young girl longs to gain the independence needed to strike out on her own. Upon meeting Gordon at a local club, it appears as if she may have finally found the means of doing so. Gordon is a few years older and has his own apartment, and one night, after a heated argument with her mother, Maggy makes the decision to move in with Gordon. Though the pair subsequently makes a sincere attempt to be good parents and do what's best for Lucy, they soon find that taking on the responsibilities of adulthood aren't so easy when you've barely moved past childhood yourself.",
