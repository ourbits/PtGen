    "introduction": "Russia Version of Winnie the Pooh and a Day for Eeyore.Another Russian Pooh story. This time the donkey, known from the Pooh stories as Eyeore, is sad because he has no tail. Pooh goes in search of one and finds it attached to a bell that hangs from the treehouse of one Owl. She (yes, in this version it's a she) is offered a bowl of honey from Pooh but she refuses to give the tail in return. Meanwhile, Piglet searches for a flower. I'll stop there and tell you that this short is twice as long as the previous ones at 18 minutes. The music, as usual, is charming and there's humor and sadness that should charm anyone, regardless of age or nationality, interested in all animation.",
