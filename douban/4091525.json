    "introduction": "A family drama about unfortunate brothers who are a Finnish version of Cain and Abel. Eighteen-year-old Rupert still suffers from the nightmares of what his abusive father made him do when he was little. To him, his father is a curse. To his younger brother Evert, however, father is still father. Trouble and conflict slowly brews between the brothers with contrasting characters, and the situation climaxes to a tragedy even Rupert does not want.The film displays a strong narrative based on an emotional story. In contrast, the plot itself is on the calm side. There aren’t any experiments and it doesn’t depart from the mainstream filmmaking methods. Still it examines the wound and its healing in an extraordinary manner, due to the sentiments and touch specific to female directors. The beautiful leading actors, their characters, and their acting also exhibit a feminine image. So far, the films made by the Aki & Mika Kaurismäki brothers have been celebrated as the best in Finland. Now, it’s time to remember the name of this newcomer. In many aspects, it’s worthy to be called the discovery of Finnish films.",
