    "introduction": "A bunch of London buddies call themselves the \"Jolly Boys,\" and devote most of their spare time to swilling beer, goofing off, and generally pursuing unambitious good times. But one day, Spider, the group's de facto leader, announces he's decided to marry his girlfriend Annie -- and what's more, he's even vying for a promotion at work. Des, his best friend, agrees to be his best man; he even gets a camcorder so he can make a video about the club's exploits before matrimony lures Spider away. But then Vinnie decides to follow Spider's example, proposing to his girlfriend Tina, and Des starts wondering if he's documenting Spider's last days of bachelorhood or the beginning of the end of the Jolly Boys.",
