The youngest granddaughter, Adela, is not yet married. The oldest has been married off to a wealthy man, and the middle daughter has been adopted by the grandmother as her full-time servant, nurse, secretary, etc. They have a piano-playing brother whose tuberculosis keeps him in and out of sanatoriums. Adela has gotten involved with the estate's handsome gardner, an aspiring theatrical set designer. Their relationship really heats up for a while, but is eventually ended when the gardener's male lover, Adele's uncle Marcello, offers to help him get settled in Buenos Aires. Meanwhile, Adela has gotten pregnant. The autocratic old grandmother receives the shock of her life when, on the same day, she discovers that her beloved youngest granddaughter is about to have a child out of wedlock, and that her son Marcello is gay.",
