    "introduction": "RetarDEAD is a 2008 zombie film from Dan West and Rick Popko (the same duo that brought horror comedy fans Monsturd back in 2002.  In fact, this film is actually an honest to goodness sequel to Monsturd. No worries if you haven’t seen the first one. We’re pretty sure this goofy zombie flick stands on its own merits.The evil mad scientist Dr. Stern is back and he’s bringing terror to the Butte County Institute of Special Education.  As you’d probably guess, the poor students there will never be the same.Dr. Stern has set out to test his fatal hyper-intelligence serum on the students only to turn them into crazy flesh hungry zombies in the process.  Dr. Stern’s arch rival, F.B.I. agent Susan Hannigan gets help from the local bumbling sheriff’s department to battle the evil scientist and the zombie horde he has created. Can agent Hannigan and the Sheriff’s Department save the day or will Dr. Stern and his army of very special zombies rule the world? You’ll have to watch this little gem to find out. If you’re looking for some off the wall zombie horror comedy action that’s not so politically correct, this is the zombie movie for you! Watch it for free below.",
