    "introduction": "This is basically two jazz-inclined musical shorts in one. First is a swingin' rendition of \"The House That Jack Built\" boasting imaginative animation in which the writing of a word turns into its meaning (such as \"cow\" turning into a cow, and so on). Second and longer is \"Old McDonald Had a Band\", where instrument sounds replace the traditional barnyard noises. With the exception of his displeased wife, Old Mac's family all jams on musical instruments, even the pets.",
