    "introduction": "In 'Silent Visitors' a number of people are portrayed for whom Japanese abandoned sites have become an essential part of their lives. Ayumi, Doitehu and Mike all share the same passion for haikyo. Their visits of these contemporary ruins reveal some parts of their unique personalities and at the same time shine a subdued light on post-tsunami Japanese society.",
