    "introduction": "First graders in a Tokyo public elementary school are presented with a challenge for the final semester: performing “Ode to Joy” at the ceremony for the new incoming first graders. Ayame, who often struggles to keep up with the group, is determined to play a major part, the big drum. We follow Ayame as she experiences shattering blows and joyous victories in the audition process. But to rehearse for the big performance, Ayame must quickly learn how to deal with newfound pressure and responsibility. When it comes time to perform in the packed auditorium, will she prevail? INSTRUMENTS OF A BEATING HEART intimately examines the Japanese educational system's tenuous balance between self-sacrifice and human growth as it teaches the next generation to become part of Japanese society.",
