    "introduction": "A personal deconstruction of the true crime genre, focusing on the figure of a relative of the director: a notorious Swedish criminal nicknamed “the Count.” As it recounts the life story of this three-times suspect of murder, the film challenges the seemingly unquenchable thirst for stories about violence. A thrilling, topical, and political documentary made to dispute the viewers’ need and wants for this type of true stories – a true Nordic noir, the first of its kind.",
