    "introduction": "Katharina is the hospital clown Fredda Meyer. While working at the children's hospital, she has grown fond of Moritz, a 12-year-old boy suffering from cancer. Moritz will die soon. Fredda stays and is there for the parents, the nurses, the cleaning staff and for Moritz. She makes jokes when no one can laugh any more. She cries clown tears when everyone is frozen. She sings when everyone falls silent. Fredda breaks the taboos and conventions of how we deal with dying.After the first short film MARINA, werkgruppe2 has produced another short film based on interviews.Translated withwww.DeepL.com/Translator(free version)",
