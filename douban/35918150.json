    "introduction": "13 August 1961: the GDR closes the sector borders in Berlin. The city is divided overnight. Escape to the West becomes more dangerous every day. But on September 14, 1962, exactly one year, one month and one day after the Wall was built, a group of 29 people from the GDR manage a spectacular escape through a 135-meter tunnel to the West. For more than four months, students from West Berlin, including two Italians, painstakingly constructed this tunnel. They risked their lives - for friends, relatives, lovers and political ideals.",
