    "introduction": "When Manuel Liñán takes the stage, he finds the freedom to be himself. Through dance, where desires meet and emotions transform, he explores the deep connection between bodies, love, and human relationships. Liñán seeks to unravel the universal need to connect without taboos and the consequences this brings to our intimacy. Through emotion and flesh, he challenges the boundaries of flamenco, merging tradition with the freedom to be oneself. In this journey, the echoes of the past intertwine with the longings of the present, creating an atmosphere where bodies speak of love, struggle, and the bonds that define us as human beings.",
