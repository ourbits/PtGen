    "introduction": "In 2005, six students from UCLA made headline news when their remains were discovered shortly after they had mysteriously disappeared whilst on a camping trip. To this day only one man, Jeremiah Coutler, has faced questions over their disappearance and murder. With his death in 2008 went the last known link to the shocking events that captured the nations attention. Recent rumors of religious malpractice and occult traditions being embraced by a remote community living deep in the forests of Humboldt County have re-opened the debate as to what happened to Donavan Buschman, Trinity Morrison, Alex Kluwer, Lucy Baer, Sarah Seale and Blair Downey. Some believe that they were victims of nature, mauled by the wild bears or wolves that are indigenous to the area. Whilst others believe that a more sinister and fantastical truth is out there. The likelihood is we'll never really know what happened on 23rd July 2005.",
