    "introduction": "Lembit Ulfsak. An actor who was elected the male star of the century and who managed to work in Estonia, in the USSR and, in the end, even in Hollywood. In order to celebrate his 75 anniversary this year, as well as the newly published book “Lembit Ulfsak”, PÖFF’s special programme, “The Golden Ratio”, will present to you three films that are included among his best role performances.When Elle Kull was in 2012 elected to stand alongside Lembit Ulfsak as the female star of the century, we can only surmise that it was their mutual performance in the film adaptation of the literature classic “Ukuaru” by Leida Laius which has been so memorable and has spanned the decades. “Ukuaru” is a larger-than-life drama about a strong woman and a weak man who are trying to find happiness in the cold drafts of a changing world. Fantastic as a film, timeless by its lead performances. Kull and Ulfsak again got to perform together a few years later in the memorable short “Promenade”.源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/ukuaru/",
