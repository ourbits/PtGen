    "introduction": "Mimi sees the world with her hands and ears. She is blind. Together with her best friend Líza, they have visited many fantastic worlds of fun and mystery. Christmas is finally coming. Mimi, Líza and their neighbours decorate a beautiful magnificent tree. However, the bulbs won’t light up. Where did the magic Christmas light disappear? Did it flee? Or did someone steal it? Maybe it’s the doings of their suspicious neighbour Viliam, who has no friends. The answer is hidden in the times when their neighbours were still small children.
