    "introduction": "John Dillinger, Machine Gun Kelly, Baby Face Nelson, and Bonnie and Clyde are some of the most notorious criminals of the last century. Technological advances like the Tommy Gun, V-8 engines with electric starters, and bulletproof vests often gave the robbers the advantage over the police. A spree of robberies, killings and kidnappings during an 18-month period from 1933 to 1934 shook the nation to its core. The government responded with a war on crime that began with America’s first national police force and the rise of the FBI. HD location photography, archival footage and evocative recreations are used to transport the viewer back to this era and to capture the hectic pace of this crime wave.",
