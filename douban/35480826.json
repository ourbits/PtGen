    "introduction": "\"Ramin and Hadley were originally set to take part in a reunion concert with Sierra Boggess in Japan, the leading trio from Phantom 25t h Anniversary, but sadly, due to covid-19 restrictions, the show had to be postponed, giving opportunity for them to stage this concert from the Setagaya Sound Studio. It's unfortunate that no live performance was able to occur, but the silver lining to this was that it allowed for a global audience to see this production via digital streaming, which under normal circumstances, many fans would not have been able to make the trip to Japan and see them in concert.Produced by Mercy Productions and The Yomiuri Shimbun, the concert is available through Mandolin, a digital entertainment streaming platform. Splitting the concert across 2 dates, May 21st and May 28th, the show offers a celebration of the music and musicals that have played a part in the duo's careers or have provided inspiration for them as artists.\"--https://www.broadwayworld.com/hong-kong/article/BWW-Review-Ramin-Karimloo-and-Hadley-Fraser-FROM-THE-REHEARSAL-ROOM-TOKYO-at-Setagaya-Sound-Studio-20210522--https://www.broadwayworld.com/hong-kong/article/BWW-Review-Ramin-Karimloo-Hadley-Fraser-FROM-THE-REHEARSAL-ROOM-TOKYO-ACT-2-at-Setagaya-Sound-Studio-20210603",
