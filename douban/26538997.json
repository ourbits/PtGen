    "introduction": "During the Baekje period, the Silla Kingdom, another country in Korean peninsular, was watching for an opportunity to unify the two regions. In the royal court of Baekje, with the destiny of its country already in decline, the royal family and its subjects passed their time singing and dancing. When the Silla army invades Baekje, loyal subjects like general Gye-Baek fight with all their might to protect the country. King Uija of Baekje tries to find a way to save the castle, but ultimately fails. Over three thousand court ladies who would rather die than be put to shame run to Nakhwa Rock and throw themselves into the waters of the Baengma River below.",
