    "introduction": "Five siblings embark on an adventure to find a bear, facing obstacles like long grass, mud, a dark forest, and a snowstorm. In a narrow cave, middle sister Rosie and her dog Rufus encounter the bear, who is cold and lonely. Despite initially being scared, Rosie befriends the bear. When the other children find her, they mistakenly drag her away, thinking the bear is dangerous. They rush home with the bear in pursuit.  Safe at home, the children share their story with disbelieving parents and grandma. That evening, during a family party, Rosie worries about the lonely bear back in his cave.Directed by Joanna Harrison and Robin ShawWritten by Joanna HarrisonMusic Composed and Conducted by Stuart Hancock‘Me & You’ Written and Performed by George EzraCast: Elsie Cavalier, Olivia Colman, Pam Ferris, Edward Osborn Latta, Macready Massey, Michael Rosen, Heather Shaw, Mark WilliamsUniversal Pictures and Herrick Entertainment present a Lupus Films production in association with Bear Hunt Films and Walker Productions for Channel 4",
