This documentary explores that success and the players behind it, as well as the questions surrounding the lack of a repeat performance.The documentary focuses on a legendary cast of characters, including head coach Mike Ditka, QB Jim McMahon and the inimitable William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry who made Chicago Bears as riveting off the field as they were on it on their way to winning Super Bowl XX",
