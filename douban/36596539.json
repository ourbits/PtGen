    "introduction": "Each May, Cannes hosts the world's most important and glamorous film festival, where global stars tread the red carpet. How did it achieve this status? What does the Palme d'Or mean for filmmakers' careers? And why do Hollywood studios constantly try to outdo each other with publicity stunts? This documentary gives a rare and intimate glimpse behind the scenes of this colossal event. Stars such as Quentin Tarantino and Sharon Stone express their opinion, as do studio bosses and the festival's director Thierry Frémaux. A revealing documentary that shows how film history is written in the region of tension between art and commerce.源自：https://zff.com/en/movies/cannes-uncut",
