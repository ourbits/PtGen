In November, author Gardel and translator Brua Dantas Lobato were honored with Brazil’s National Book Award for the novel.The film will be centered on Raimundo, an illiterate man whose teenage love with another male was brutally discovered 30 years prior. Now aged 45 and leading a quiet life in the city, he is haunted by his secret past until he forms an unexpected friendship with a Black transvestite, Suzzanny, and learns to read.Story is billed as “a sweeping story of repression, violence, and shame, along with their flipside: love, survival and endurance of unforgettable figures on society’s margins.”",
