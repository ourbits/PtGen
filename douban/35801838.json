When the melting glacier releases a corpse, old secrets and new desires come to light, and Lucia, the newly arrived doctor, gets caught up in a maelstrom of strange occurrences that cause a rift in her family. Little by little, she unearths the village’s secret surrounding the corpse they discovered. She believes neither in fate nor in the supernatural, but when her daughter disappears, Lucia is forced to accept her mission: to save Alma, she must face the mystery of the mountains.",
