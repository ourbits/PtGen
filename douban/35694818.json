Raised in an orphanage, the matured Katya learns from one of her mother's friends about the existence of her father, who lives in Turkey. And the girl, in search of her father, goes to the Turkish city of Trabzon. The poor girl will have to endure many disappointments, betrayal and troubles while she tries to find her father ... And will it bring her joy?",
