    "introduction": "IQ-145 is a new web-based series starring Thomas Dekker, the young male lead of \"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.\"The series follows Nate Palmer, recruited by a secret organization to help search for his (famous inventor) father's last experiment.Shot almost entirely in front of green screen in hi-def, the near-future science fiction show is as stunningly beautiful as it is interesting. It sure got me hooked!Each week, I wait for a new episode to be posted on the cool IQ-145 Web site (which incredibly is free AND devoid of any advertising.)The Web may be the future of television, but I did not think anything like that could be available now. It's awesome!IQ-145 is the brainchild of Billy Dickson, a DP/Director who has worked on \"Babylon 5,\" \"One Tree Hill,\" \"Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers\" and many other productions.",
