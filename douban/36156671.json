    "introduction": "It’s 2011. For Michael Jordan, the year ahead will be a very strange one. Once a player who could seemingly deliver championships through sheer force of will, the owner of the Charlotte Bobcats is finally developing the one skill he had always denied himself: patience. Nothing about that is easy, and nothing about the lovable, unforgettable 2011-2012 Bobcats will be easy. But as much as he despises losing, Mike has always seemed to love the struggle.",
