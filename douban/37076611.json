    "introduction": "This film centres around a scene in Blade Runner in which the main character, Rick Deckard, is examining a photograph using a machine that allows him to zoom in on certain parts of the picture. Not only is he able to zoom in, but it’s revealed that he can also look around and behind objects within the photograph. In doing so, Deckard can draw out clues that, from the perspective of current technology, it would seem impossible to see. Deckard’s investigation in the film ultimately reveals things not just about the case he’s working on, but also about himself.",
