    "introduction": "Running a taco lunch cart is tough, even for a privileged young man who is trying to make it on his own. Walter and his friend Casey set up business serving lunch to the workers of Los Angeles, but have a hard time fitting in. Walter’s idealistic “going green” approach doesn’t pay the bills, and he lacks the street-cred of the experienced hash-slingers. Keeping a business together is hard on his friendship with Casey, played with scene-stealing flair by Charlie Pecoraro. Will Walter succeed at the American Dream?",
