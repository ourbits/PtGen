    "introduction": "A short New York comedy directed by New York-based filmmaker Noah Pritzker, starring Kieran Culkin and Mae Whitman. Realism gives way to a strange dreamlike sequence in this selection from the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival.The film begins very much rooted in the tradition of New York romantic comedies — a couple quarrels in Central Park — but it takes an odd, funny twist as other people from Norman’s life suddenly emerge in the Park, one after another to analyze Norman, as if justifying his girlfriend’s arguments.",
