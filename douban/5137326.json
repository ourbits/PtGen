    "introduction": "Philip K. Dick may be science fiction's greatest writer ever. His novels and stories continue to inspire a generation of filmmakers, writers, technophiles and philosophers. But for the last ten years of his life, he inhabited a reality stranger than the fiction he created. Hear about the mysterious break-in at his California home, the letter he thought would kill him, the series of visions he believed were Divinely inspired and the 8,000 page manuscript he wrote in an effort to unlock the meaning of it all. Combining interviews with animation, a pulsating techno soundtrack, and rare audio recordings of PKD himself, the filmmakers have created a portrait that Film Threat calls \"a labor of love, designed to appeal to fans and novices alike.\"",
