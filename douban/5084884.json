    "introduction": "Hedy (1966, 66 minutes), directed by Andy Warhol with scenario by Ronald Tavel and music by John Cale and Lou Reed. A satirical farce, Hedy portrays the story of faded Hollywood actress Hedy Lamarr. Once celebrated as one of the most beautiful women alive, Lamarr was famously arrested for shop lifting in a Los Angeles department store. Fact and fiction collide as celebrity gossip is used to present a darker side of fame, one in which beauty and pain become synonymous. The film stars Mario Montez as Hedy, along with Arnold Rockwood, Jack Smith, Ingrid Superstar, Mary Woronov, Harvey Tavel, Ronald Tavel, Randy Bourscheidt, Roderick Clayton, James Fox Claire, and David Myers.",
