This challenging relationship is further strained by Sylvia's twin daughters who have been victimized by a string of Sylvia's past boyfriends and want no part of Gil. True love, family, forgiveness, dreams and drama all play into this quirky tale directed by Shane Hagedorn from a script by DJ Perry.—CDI",
