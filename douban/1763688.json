Are you related?\". \"I dont know, lets find out\" Agnes Varda replied.They went there on a thursday and met this Yanco (Jean Varda) who was the cousin of her fathers. So she made this little movie about this old man, living on a boat with his hippie friends, making a living as a painter.Altogether a nice little film, a typical Varda movie.",
