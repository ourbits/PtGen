    "introduction": "Bugs Bunny and all his cartoon friends are stage performers entertaining audiences with 7 features per show, all of which are classic theatrical cartoons from the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s. Brief interaction sequences on stage between characters was often intercut between the features. All shows began with Bugs and Daffy Duck singing \"This is It\" and a procession of cartoon stars marching across the stage. Then, a Road Runner song would play, accompanied by clips from his cartoons. All characters appeared at some point in the series, though the ones most frequently seen were Bugs, the Road Runner, Wile E. Coyote, Yosemite Sam, Elmer Fudd, Tweety Bird, Sylvester Cat, Sylvester Junior, Hippety Hopper (the \"Giant Mouse\"), and Foghorn Leghorn.",
