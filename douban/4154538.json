    "introduction": "This documentary features interviews with seven women who have been diagnosed with various mental disorders, including schizophrenia, manic-depression and self-mutilation. Common threads between them are sexual abuse, dispiriting encounters with mental health professionals and creative pursuits that are often hard to separate from their mental illness. Among those interviewed is Allie Light, the film's director, who discusses how her depression helped inspire her to become a filmmaker.",
