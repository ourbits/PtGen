A conflictual relationship with his father and the struggle to charm his flatmate Giulia, who he is madly in love with. He's a member of the MOB, an indie band that performs in the legendary music club The Morrison. There, he crosses paths with Libero Ferri, a forgotten rockstar who's trying to take back his career. His quest for success not only causes him to neglect his beautiful wife Luna but he's turning him into an introvert, living in solitude in a luxurious mansion filled with memorabilia.This unexpected encounter will bring the two men close and force them to overcome the generational gap and the personal differences while pushing each other towards achievement. A road studded with dreams, failure, friendship, and odd characters in the background. \"",
