    "introduction": "Abe is an ambitious young journalist at an independent Chicago weekly. He has a lead on a story that could make his career. Debra, a woman claiming to work in national security, has a serious revelation to leak. She insists on meeting Abe in a desolate place in the American West - perhaps because it is near her undisclosed work site, or perhaps because she will only reveal her information in absolute isolation. In minutes they will meet. An hour later, one of them will be dead. This simple premise unfolds multiple layers of depth as the tension is raised to almost unbearable levels.",
