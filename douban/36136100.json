    "introduction": "Leah, a respected therapist, is enjoying unparalleled professional success: a hit book, TV appearances, a full client roster - but she still can't shake the trauma of her last relationship, and the guilt that her ex went on to kill his next partner. As Leah works on her own demons by helping others with theirs, she takes on a mysterious new client, Anna, who seems more intent on exploring Leah's past than her own. As Anna manipulates Leah into her home, Leah discovers that Anna is the sister of the slain partner, who blames Leah for not alerting the authorities sooner. Forced to confront her own guilt and the danger of a family member seeking revenge, will Leah make it out unscathed?",
