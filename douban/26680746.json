    "introduction": "Jelena and her mother Vera left Russia 20 years ago to come to Germany. Since this time, they've been living together in a tiny two bedroom appartment. Vera is almost 70 now and unable to accept reality in Germany. In her mind, she still lives in Russia, where she was a famous dancer. She gave up everything to allow her daughter to make her career in the west. But Jelena only managed to get a job as a dance teacher for chubby little girls.",
