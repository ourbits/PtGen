    "introduction": "Platon described the limitations of human cognition with a famous cave theory. But today, artists working in the studio were increasingly being criticized. This video was shot by the artist himself by the use of a rope to tie yourself to, an emergency flashlight and a hole printed in the paper pasted on the wall that he faced every day. All symbolic meanings were just a facadein fact, but just the artist himself in his studio, which was a paradox.柏拉图有一个著名的洞穴理论来形容人认知的局限性。而在今天，在工作室里工作的艺术家越来越受到批评。这个录像是艺术家一个人在自己工作室拍摄而成，一条绳子把自己系上，一个应急手电，一个印在纸上的洞穴贴在自己每天画画所面对的墙上。所有象征性意义在这时其实只是个幌子，只是一个艺术家在自己工作室而已，一个悖论。",
