    "introduction": "The Honey Trap is a feature documentary centered on Denis Cuspert (aka Deso Dogg) and his journey from infamous German rapper to ISIS recruiter. Director Chris Moukarbel (Cypher, Gaga Five Foot Two) tells an unexpected story, layering subjects such as Arab/Muslim representation as well as the circular relationship between Hollywood studios and the US Military. The film explores propaganda, recruitment, and the soft power of entertainment culture, woven with an affair between Cuspert and the FBI translator assigned to investigate him.",
