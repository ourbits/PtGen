    "introduction": "A grandfather and his grandson go to a fair to sell a horse. A ranger and his vicious partner, Matijevic, follow them as they return home in order to rob them. The confrontation takes place in the forest.Having made three films marked by their modernist use of structure, Mimica then reverted to more traditionally plotted films. The first of these, Dogadjaj (The Event, 1969), is about a farmer Jure and his grandson Marian. The boy, having lost his father, lives in perpetual fear that he will lose his grandfather, too. When Jure announces that they will have to go to town to sell their horse, Marian is filled with a horrible, prescient feeling that his worst fear is about to come true.The trip starts well: the horse is sold for 3000 dinars and Marian buys a radio and forms a friendship with a girl who can speak backwards. On the return journey, it becomes apparent that Jure and Marian are being followed. Despite trying to lose their pursuers, Jure is forced to fight them hand-to-hand while Marian runs for his life. The fight ends with Jure being knifed.Marian is given refuge by a ranger's wife, but the house he has stumbled on harbours two coincidences: the ranger's daughter is the girl who could speak backwards and the ranger is one of his father's killers. The other killer is far from happy that the crime has a witness, and demands he be silenced forever. This film, becoming more conventional as the action procedes, yet again focusses on nature.",
