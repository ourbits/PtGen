    "introduction": "It;s 1934, and America is powered by an explosion of gee-whiz thingamajigs that baffle and astound. The Muffulaphone! The Crumb-Ulator! The Electric Bim! Millions of ordinary Americans use these wonders every day without hesitating to ask - what makes it all possible? Why, science does, of course! It all comes from a secret government laboratory hidden 2.2 trillion micrometers beneath the surface of the earth, in the fabled land of Lemuria. Run by a team of crack scientists and insightful robots, the lab tackles advances in modern physics and packages them for the modern consumer.",
