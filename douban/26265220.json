He's sure his prize salmon will help him win Fish Chef of the Year award - and a one-way ticket out of his dull seaside town. With the judge arriving the next morning he heads home early to get some rest. But on the way he's lured into a local swimming pool by an insatiable mermaid. Now he has to make a choice - satisfy his libido in the lido or keep focused on the future.",
