    "introduction": "Marija (Emilia Schüle) comes to Germany to earn a living for her family in the Ukraine. From now on she will take care of the household and the care of Curt (Günther Maria Halmer) who is suffering from dementia around the clock. But after a serious car accident by his daughter Almut (Anna Stieblich), Marija is suddenly left to fend for herself with the grumpy owl. Curt begins to mistake her for his deceased wife, and Marija - at first involuntarily - slips into her role and clothes. The bizarre game of a past marriage is interrupted by Curt's son Philipp (Fabian Hinrichs), who is very fond of Marija. When he tries to win her over, things start to get out of hand.",
