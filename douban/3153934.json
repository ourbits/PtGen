It's the Jachvliani brothers' first attempt at directing, and they've taken an apparently true story and turned it into a captivating, compelling movie which shows how once the cycle of blood revenge starts in a small community even a family's dog is not immune from the consequences.http://newportbeach.bside.com/2008/films/svani_newportbeach2008http://www.messenger.com.ge/issues/1581_april_4_2008/1581_svani.html",
