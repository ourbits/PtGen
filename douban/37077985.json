    "introduction": "One-Way Ticket To The Other Side presents a series of deeply personal short films centered around the debut album of the musical duo Pornographie Exclusive (Severine Cayron and Jerome Vandewattyne). It is a cinematic, musical, and surreal journey that follows two stoic outlaws as they wander through a world suspended between end and beginning, dream and reality. Their road trip leads them through strange places and encounters with lost souls, immersing them in both absurd and philosophical reflections. Shot in a guerrilla filmmaking style with a warm, grainy look, each poetic tableau of their adventure weaves together the different segments of this unique anthology directed by international filmmakers. In these parallel realms, it is not the story that inspires the music, but rather the music that gives birth to the stories.",
