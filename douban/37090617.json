    "introduction": "The protagonist of the film is a psychologist, who faces a difficult task: to return demobilized soldiers to a normal peaceful life and help them socialize. By healing their souls, he does much more than help each patient personally. It helps millions of civilians to accept into society those who consider themselves exiles. Through the prism of the protagonist, we show the life and difficulties faced by soldiers returning home from the front. We will experience all the victories and failures of the protagonist and his wards.",
