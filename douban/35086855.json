    "introduction": "The protagonist is Stefan Lysenko, who started strong in his 20 year acting career but eventually fizzled out, turning into a B movie actor. Frustrated, he turns to making his own shoestring-budget movies, which have led only to debt. Long a fan of John Cassavetes and now living in the apartment where John shot a crucial scene from the movie \"Minnie and Moskowiz\", Stefan embarks on a quest to re-make the 1971 classic, using locations already at his disposal, in an effort to re-introduce Cassavetes to the public...but it's a fool's errand and he will turn into Don Quixote, tilting at windmills.",
