    "introduction": "Allahabad-based Raj Raibahadur lives a wealthy lifestyle with his widowed businessman dad. His mom had passed away, a victim to tuberculosis, compelling his anxious dad to keep him away from the hustle, bustle and pollution associated with cities. As a result Raj ends up in the countryside, involved in the construction of a dam. His dad asks him to commence correspondence with a Riva-based young woman by the name of Chandra Rai, with a view to get him married, to which Raj agrees. The correspondence starts, and even without meeting each other, Chandra and Raj fall in love. They cement they love when they finally meet with each other. When Raj tells him dad, the marriage proposal is put forth, but to Raj's shock and dismay, Chandra rejects him. It is only later that Raj finds out that the woman he had corresponded with was not Chandra, but her younger sister, Neelu. Then the Raibahadur family physician, Dr. Kailash, gives them devastating news that Raj has tuberculosis and is not expected to live too long. Watch what Raj does to convince Chandra of his love, and try to prove to Neelu that she should forget him and get married to Kailash instead.",
