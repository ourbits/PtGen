    "introduction": "Another collaborative work by An Jungju & Jun Sojung is Automatic Autonomy (2020) employs body cameras, AI-based closed-circuit security cameras, and the artists’ camera to record the movements of a choreographer in the historic setting of Seoul’s Deoksugung Palace. It illustrates a digital form of calibration, where a historic space and its layers of time are fragmented into sound bits and pixels. The crumbled time-space portrayed in this work is heightened by the randomly captured subjects through the dancer’s movements and the automated angles of the machines that detect such movements beyond the intended framing of the artists.",
