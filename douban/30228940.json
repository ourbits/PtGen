    "introduction": "The farmer-mice are about to relax after a hard day's harvesting, when they notice a meteor falling from the sky. But that's no meteor. It's Super Mouse, come to visit--and show off a bit. Two mice get his autograph; another compares his own muscles to the superhero's. When Super Mouse flies off, a little mouse jumps onto the hero's shadow speeding across the ground. The mouse rides the shadow until Super Mouse flies over a cliff. Catching the falling child is Super Mouse's first rescue of the day. But it won't be his last. After Super Mouse leaves, three cats set upon the farmers, planning to eat the defenseless creatures. Super Mouse, sitting on a distant star, hears the turmoil.",
