    "introduction": "16-year-old Yuguo, who has a passion for Eastern European romantic poetry, makes a pilgrimage from his home in China to the foothills of Romania’s Carpathian Mountains.There are not many 16-year-olds in China that spend their days reading 19th century Eastern European romantic poetry, but Yuguo is not like most 16-year-olds. This intimate film follows Yuguo’s own teenage romanticism and adventurous spirit as he travels to Bacau in Romania to begin a study abroad programme. Yuguo’s sincerity and open heartedness is infectious and hard for the people of Bacau to resist. Across just 80 days, we share the beautiful adventure of Yuguo’s journey, and witness the profound impact one person can have in the lives of others.",
