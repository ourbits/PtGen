    "introduction": "An 8mm animation that was produced by Harada during his 3rd year in high school. High school students occupy a high school and barricade themselves in it out of dissatisfaction with their school. However, the story is that the students, who did not have a clear policy or philosophy, eventually split up and fell apart.The music includes an original song written by a friend, \"Children's Heart,\" \"St. Louis Blues,'' sung by a cousin, and Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 4. I [Harada] like the content of the works that I created during my middle and high school days. If I had unlimited time and health, I would redraw and remake everything. However, human life is short, and drawing animation takes an enormous amount of time. It is almost certainly a dream that will never come true.",
