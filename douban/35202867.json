    "introduction": "Seven years ago, Pope Francis denounced the \"globalization of indifference\" in Lampedusa and said that \"this system of capitalism kills.\" The moment Italy criminalizes the rescue of people who are drowning, the Catholic Church returns to its socio-revolutionary roots: what does the Bible really ask of us? What was meant by the radical \"no\" by the Christian prophet when confronted with the system of Roman imperialism and exploitation? Who would Jesus fight for today - and who would be fighting at his side? In Italy, at the southern edge of the EU, where African refugees are forced into labor as harvesters, where peasants are fighting for survival due to increasing grain imports, Milo Rau creates THE NEW GOSPEL - a hybrid film dealing with the life and death of probably the most influential religious founder in world history. Who are the displaced people, the outcasts, the humiliated ones of today's world order? What is left of Jesus' message of salvation in times of global exploitation?",
