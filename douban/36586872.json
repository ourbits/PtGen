    "introduction": "The main component of Familiar's sound is the recording of a denunciation related to the case of a brother of Apolonia Flores Rotela, who was consequently shot and detained at 12 years of age. The video shows the file that was made on the teenager and the crimes that she was accused of, along with the sound recording of Stroessner's swearing-in as president, with a repetition that evokes the continuity of the dictatorship for decades. Also fragments of family films in Super 8 about “civic” acts of the regime and other events in the lives of people who had a comfortable social position under the tyranny, ironically accompanied at the end by the waltz The Blue Danube by Johann Strauss.",
