    "introduction": "Bravissimo!!! Grazie Dio per \"Cinema Italian Style.\" This film was arduous to view and you could feel everyone in the theater squirming in their seats. Brilliant intelligent film that demands you ask questions of yourself, your friends, society, the world and everything you thought to be true. It does not matter what country you are from because we are all a mess. Life is a messy affair, families are messy, this story is about the ultimate mess that we create. The monster is made at home in the kitchen. This movie only asks questions, it gives no solutions or answers, I'm certain it will never be released in the U.S... This film is so complex on so many levels that it is impossible to make the typical trivial comments. The passion, perceptions and intellect of everyone involved in the making of this movie is evident from the first frame. See it if you still believe film is an art form.",
