    "introduction": "Haunted by an abusive childhood, Audrey, a Korean American woman in her 30s, faces her emotional past. When her mother’s car accident brings her back to her parents’ home, she meets the man responsible for the accident. Their relationship builds, passions ignite, and they form a loving connection.Audrey and Eli are very different people, but they are haunted by their past in a similar way. Having lived through difficult times as children of immigrant parents, they carry their hurt and isolation in their adulthood with the accompanying confusion of how to care for family and themselves. Actors Moon Choi and Son Sukku sparkle as two people who find each other amid all the guilt, anger, and “han,” and, in doing so, find a way to heal. In her feature debut, marked with great vulnerability, writer-director Stephanie Ahn beautifully articulates the complicated emotional landscape of immigrant children who are now all grown up. Bedford Park is a heartfelt expression of human experience not often seen on screen. It is a film so many have been waiting for. — SS",
