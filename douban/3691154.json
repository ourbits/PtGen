His parents Anica and Vlado have lived in Germany for 35 years, but want to realize their dream of an own hotel in their native country Croatia. As Vlado is a hard and ambitious father, his relationship to Nikola became very difficult, while his younger brother Joso plans to go back with his parents. The third son, Branko, committed suicide after participating in the Yugoslavian civil war. On the eve of the homecoming, Nikola confesses to his father that his career has failed and accuses him of destroying the whole family.",
