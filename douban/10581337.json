    "introduction": "In 1990, Jordan made another classic Visible Compendium , a 17-minute work which took 2-1/2 years to make and relates to an idyllic trip in a hot air balloon as an enigmatic journey. Here, he also begins to focus on sound as collage by collecting audio bits and pieces as he did with pictures. The film itself is cut to the soundtrack, which mixed both recognizable and unrecognizable sounds, making it a true \"compendium.\" The film is a kind of a puzzle constructed from fragments of unnamed meanings and fragments of light--light being the base for all film--in which Jordan wants the viewer to discover his own meaning in these films by bringing a personal predisposition into play. Today, Visible Compendium remains an important experiment into the secrets of the unknown.",
