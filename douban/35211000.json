The grandmother spends her days feeding them delusional tales about their supposed grandfather and the love of her life: José Doroteo Arango Arámbula, better known as Pancho Villa. The idea of being descendants of the charismatic revolutionary and general, who is considered a great Mexican hero, fuels the brothers’ imaginations. On the night of a lunar eclipse, they take some hallucinogenic peyote. Sharing a peyote vision, and accompanied by their only mare, they set off to look for their legendary grandfather's missing head. Its disappearance is one of the greatest mysteries in Mexico. A surrealistic comedy in which everything is possible.",
