    "introduction": "An unmistakable master of the intersection between documentary and narrative, Mark Rappaport easily ranks among the great filmmakers of our time. As Jonathan Rosenbaum noted in the introduction to his Cineaste interview with the director from 1996, \"Rappaport virtually invented a new form of film criticism in ROCK HUDSON'S HOME MOVIES, a melange of clips and commentary...\" FROM THE JOURNALS OF JEAN SEBERG builds impressively on that remarkable accomplishment. With Mary Beth Hurt portraying the actress, Rappaport's \"fictional essay\" arrive at places that conventional documentaries are largely unable to reach.",
