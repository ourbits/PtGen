    "introduction": "Belgrade in 1992. Hiding from night mobilizations, a young doctor requests third-shift work, instead of his colleague who died on war-front. He meets a pleasant old woman who, realizing that he finished Faculty of literature, asks him for help in arranging her precious home library. Astonished, he finds out that it is a sensational collection of rare books (sequence of \"Dead Souls\", \"Mountain Range\" etc.) which gives a new light to the history of literature. His joy and peace lasts shortly, because he has dream of his dead colleague, warning him. Unfortunate man finds out he is surrounded by vampires, which are difficult to recognize. Unfortunately, they change lives and alter destinies.http://www.filmovi.com/en/film/490.shtmlFull moon over Belgrade is one of the few \"forgotten movies\" which had the sad fate to be released in Serbia during the war in Former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (91-95) and therefore had almost no life after the release (in this case, somewhat for it's anti-war tone as well). It was later released on VHS, but was quickly forgotten and soon became a sort of rarity to find.",
