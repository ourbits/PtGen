    "introduction": "The French Lieutenant’s Woman by director BAEK Seung-bin is a defining film of John Fowles’ novel of the same title; it is, at the same time, a parody of the writer. The mother believes her child’s father to be John Fowles, and herself to be the French lieutenant's woman. She makes her child copy the novel by handwriting it over and over again. Their lives vibrate between the imitation of art and the distorted aspect of life. The boy transcends to become a romantic artist through poisoning in his imagination, but in reality, he must clean up his mother’s excrement. This contrast between imagination and reality also represents the two faces of a human being. (Hong Hyosook)",
