    "introduction": "The last days of April is the title of a new coming of age film to be released in September( USA) . I found out about it thanks to Stephen Ryder who is its script writer and producer .  He is also the screenwriter of the masterpiece L.I.E and was kind enough to answer to some questions about his new production.  Before proceeding with the exclusive interview  with Mr. Ryder I would like to quote the film`s synopsis which so far is the only publicly available information about it :“A beautiful young woman who is a murderous sexual psychopath returns from combat as a mercenary in Iraq and abducts a 14 yr-old boy, holding him prisoner as a bizarre relationship develops “It is definitely not your average plot  and my expectations for this production fueled by the official trailer (which  can  be seen below)  are quite high.The last days of April seems to be a combination of thriller and a drama with  a coming of age overtone .  The young lead TJ Plunkett seems to be a very talented actor even if I only had the short trailer to form my opinion on that.",
