They decided to create a short video to address these questions and quickly realized that they had enough exciting content for at least one documentary. They decided to create something that would excite the public about recent advances and show just how close we are to a number of significant breakthroughs. They also wanted to create something could be used by scientists and researcher to make the case that more support is needed from government, philanthropists, businesses and the public if we are to unlock the secrets of the human brain.",
