    "introduction": "Follows the story of a prospective husband and wife named Salim and Tasya. The two decided to move their pre-wedding photo shoot to Salim's family home after his aunt, Salim's only blood relative, passed away. In addition to having to take care of his aunt's funeral, Salim also had to continue the family ritual of burning incense every day on a mysterious altar. If not, his life would be in danger. Unexpectedly, their presence along with the photo shoot team in the house actually made the spirits of Salim's ancestors who died during the Japanese occupation appear and start terrorizing them. Instead of feeling afraid, Tasya was moved to uncover the mystery of Salim's family's past in order to free her prospective husband from his obligations so that they could leave the house. What really happened? Will Tasya succeed in carrying out her mission?",
