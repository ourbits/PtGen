    "introduction": "Shot in stunning black and white, with scenes that could be outtakes from some surreal haute-couture photo shoot, Phantom Love might just be the most beautiful film of the year. Looks aren't everything, however, and this is no hollow aesthetic exercise. As we follow alienated protagonist Lulu (Marina Shoif) on an impromptu trip into the darkest reaches of her own psyche - seemingly undertaken as a distraction while an unsatisfactory lover labours away on top of her - writer/director Nina Menkes creates a dreamscape of epic imaginative reach. There are shades of Alain Resnais and David Lynch here, but this film's lush mysteries are all its own - and the road that Lulu travels makes Mulholland Drive look like a layby.(source:http://www.edfilmfest.org.uk/films/phantom-love/)",
