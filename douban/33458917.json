    "introduction": "Renata presents herself to the camera like one of these fascinating film noir heroines: a beautiful woman with a nondescript accent, with assured gestures, who looks people right in the eyes. Sentenced to a prison term for a man’s murder, Renata has not lost her charisma behind bars. Does she accept the crime she committed? Does she regret having killed someone. A neighbour? A lover? Is she aware of her imprisonment? In front of Alexis Delgado Búrdalo’s camera, Renata gradually shows her colours, without ever completely opening up, without ever delivering the certainty of her thoughts. Over the years and the intimate conversations between the filmmaker and Renata, we witness the deconstruction of a protagonist who no longer distinguishes between the real and the staged, who reveals this capacity of the human soul to multiply. This Film Is About Me proposes a game of mirages on the relationship between film and the construction of a character. A film that says as much about Renata than it does about its director. An anti-portrait that questions the limits of representation.",
