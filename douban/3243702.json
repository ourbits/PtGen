    "introduction": "I'm in agreement with this way of making films, trying to focus on a few simple things: the simplicity of the essence is always very close to the beauty. This movie has the \"face\" very clean, just told you the facts directly, without pretending to sell you a vacuum cleaner. It's very true, you can touch with your hand the beautiful hair of Cristina Galbó too, or swimming the Mediterraneo with them. Some script ideas are as good as originals.This movie is quite, because the big error of most actual filmmakers it's to relate a lot of tales in a very fast way in order to avoid the public to get bored, when the key is one another. Pedro Olea with this opera prima got some beauty feelings without the typical manipulation of professionals. The camera don't be at a loss between all that beautiful sea and sun and it could capture an instant. Possibly the end of an epoch.It was filmed in Torremolinos at the \"Costa del Sol\", now it's an acquaintance tourist centre of high development, and the magic of that \"old color\" has been lost, but it will be always alive in this movie thanks to the work of an illuminate young team.",
