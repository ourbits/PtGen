It's been a difficult year for Julie and this is a fresh start for her and her teenager daughter Miya. Though Julie hopes that being both the new kid and the new teacher's daughter won't be too hard on Miya, she can't help but worry when her daughter becomes fast friends with the school's resident mean girl, Amy Turner. Amy's dangerously manipulative ways and fierce obsession with becoming prom queen leave Julie not only concerned for her daughter's safety, but questioning just how far Amy will go to win that crown.",
