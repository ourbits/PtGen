    "introduction": "Born and raised in Rotterdam, Zeki experiences the trauma of losing his mother; this trauma is further compounded by his father Mahir's decision to relocate to Türkiye. While Mahir goes to work, fourteen-year-old Zeki has to spend his summer vacation within the walls of the gated community where they live. Zeki, who practices the sport of free running, manages to escape the walls of the complex. There, he encounters children living in the surrounding slums and befriends Kemal. As Kemal and Zeki's friendship deepens, Kemal's best friend becomes jealous of their bond. Zeki arrives in İstanbul with preconceived notions, but as he encounters new people and becomes part of a new circle of friends, he discovers a world that is both enjoyable and liberating.源自：https://www.antalyaff.com/en/movies/nationalfeaturefilm/23/317",
