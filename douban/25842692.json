Nash who has just transferred from London, investigates the murder of Vicky Phillips, a local physiotherapist who was stabbed to death in her car. Frost suspects one of her patients, Jonathan Meyerbridge, who has a criminal record but is now a born-again Christian. The local butcher, Mr. Sykes, is also acting strangely and denies knowing the dead woman even though she had keys to the vacant flat above his shop. Frost is also investigating a series of smash and grab robberies in the commercial district. The culprits drive a vehicle through the front window of a business and take anything they can within a minute or so before they scamper off.",
