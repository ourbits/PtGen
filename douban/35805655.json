    "introduction": "With great expressive freedom, Diana Toucedo transports us to a seaside village in Galicia. We are invited to observe the work of the women who collect shellfish, and hear from their own voices their relationship with their trade, the heritage of matriarchy and their sense of belonging. Sailors at sea complement this genuine and devoted community of workers.",
