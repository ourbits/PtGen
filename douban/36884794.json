Nobody in the meadow has ever seen a white fawn and think he is making up stories. But Little White Owl tells of a place of mystical white creatures in the next valley, so the friends go on an adventure… across the streamy stream, and through the woody woods to search for the mythical white fawn.From the bestselling picture book Guess How Much I Love You™,by Sam McBratney and Anita Jeram. Published by Walker Books.",
