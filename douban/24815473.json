    "introduction": "Handsome real estate agent Max (Jon Fleming) harbors crazed visions of murder and meets the person to make his dreams a reality when he picks up cute and seemingly timid waiter Sebastian (Ryan Kibby). After hooking up and becoming a couple, they seek unusual thrills, first by inviting a stud over for a threesome, second by gleefully strangling said stud to death. Excited by their crime, they soon become a killing machine, and every hunky gay stud and hustler in the neighborhood is their potential victim. As the killings accelerate and the corpses pile up, the boys are turned on, and the only kink in their murderous shenanigans is their queeny neighbor, who becomes suspicious when he sees boys entering their apartment but never leaving. So if you are tired of the saccharine rom-coms and issue-driven docs in the festival and want to see a different kind of gay love story, Violence of the Mind fits the bill nicely. And if you need a moral to this tale, it is that love can make you do some strange things, especially if you are a horny gay psychopath!",
