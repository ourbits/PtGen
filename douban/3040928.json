    "introduction": "Chance (Amber Benson) is a single, neurotic, 20-something woman living in Los Angeles trying to get by any way she can (waitressing, acting, etc.) Her one true goal in life, as her frequent narration to the viewers, are to find her 'Mr. Right'. The people in Chance's life are Simon (James Marsters), her slacker roommate and telemarketer whom has a crush on her, but is too much in denial to admit it to her or even himself; Rory (Rayder Woods), a struggling actor and Chance's ex-boyfriend with massive crush on her, but he's too boring for her to be interested; Milton (Nate Barlow) is her creepy voyeuristic neighborhood whom lusts after her; Jack (Andy Hallett) is a struggling singer whom Chance finds attractive, but unaware that he's gay; Guy (Shamus Murphy) is another person in Chance's life whose romance is cut short by an accident; Sara (Tressa DiFigla) is a young and outgoing bisexual woman from Manchester, England whom after a one-night stand with Chance, ends up dead from a drug OD, or does she? And then there's Chance's mother Desiree (Christina Estabrook) who's even more crazy than Chance, and distraught over her husband Malcolm (Jeff Rickets) divorcing her to be with his personal secretary.
