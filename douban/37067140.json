    "introduction": "Aging is too often portrayed as a time of obsolescence, especially for women. Filmmaker Azza Cohen’s 82-year-old magnetic grandma is having none of that: “Everything is an attitude; we can’t act old.” Join Bubbe as she tackles her bucket list, bravely stripping down, wrestling on a wetsuit, and learning to swim. Sure, she’s got aches and pains and an inadequate Medicare plan like any octogenarian. But instead of kvetching, Bubbe embraces her wrinkles, varicose veins, and \"hangy buzzies” and dives headfirst into a pool of possibility. “It’s all been fun,” she assures us. Jump in with her - the water’s warm.",
