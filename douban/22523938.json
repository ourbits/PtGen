    "introduction": "After decades abroad, renowned ballroom dancer Pierre Dulaine returns to his hometown of Jaffa, Israel. Fueled by his belief in dancing’s power to build self-esteem and social awareness, he starts to teach ballroom basics to the mixed population of local schools—boldly pairing Palestinians with Jews, putting many of the children’s and, more pointedly, their families’ beliefs to the test.   Under his passionate, no-nonsense guidance, historical archenemies begin to forge an innocent relationship that quickly takes on a much larger significance than initially meets the eye.",
