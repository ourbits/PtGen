    "introduction": "A group of Kuchi children are living in a minefield around Bagram airfield, Afghanistan. They dig out anti-personal mines in order to sell the explosives to child workers mining in a Lappis Lazulli mine. The trajectory of the blue precious stones goes towards Tajikistan and China, through an area controlled by child soldiers. When they are not waging their own mini-wars in the daily madness of life in Afghanistan, the children are fleeing away in their personal fantasies and dreams, while the American soldiers are planning their retreat... \"The Land of the Enlightened\" is a hybrid feature documentary by a young first-time director with a huge passion for the Afghan people and for the extraordinary beauty of their war tormented country. Filmed over a period of 5 years in different regions throughout the country on amazing 16mm footage.",
