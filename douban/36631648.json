    "introduction": "Simona Kossak (Sandra Drzymalska), daughter of painter Jerzy Kossak and granddaughter of Wojciech Kossak, grows up under the shadow of her family's illustrious artistic legacy. Lacking the talent that has defined her family for generations, she is subjected to a cold, despotic upbringing by her mother (Agata Kulesza). Upon graduation, Simona defies her heritage, abandoning home, tradition, and social conventions to pursue a career as a scientist in Białowieża. Immersing herself in the heart of the forest, she embraces a life of simplicity, living in a house without electricity or running water, surrounded by wilderness. In this enchanting wilderness, she encounters Lech Wilczek (Jakub Gierszał), a photographer who shares her passion for nature and freedom. Their unconventional relationship defies societal norms and expectations. However, Simona's vision of a naturalist's work and her position as a young woman in a male-dominated field are soon challenged. She must fiercely defend her ideals and the natural world she cherishes. Simona Kossak is an inspiring tale of independence and determination, capturing the essence of finding one's place on earth and the eternal quest for intimacy and community.",
