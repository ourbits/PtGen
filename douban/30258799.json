    "introduction": "20 years ago horror pic Wolf Creek proved an Australian box office breakout making $30M global off a $1M budget. A sequel followed in 2013 and for years there was talk of a third movie. The scent went cold but now the franchise is getting a reboot with Wolf Creek: Legacy.Creator Greg Mclean is back to reignite the franchise as a producer while John Jarratt, who plays Outback serial-killer Mick Taylor, returns in the lead role. Resident Evil producer Jeremy Bolt is newly aboard, as is Sean Lahiff as director. Lahiff was editor on Wolf Creek 2 so knows his way around the franchise. Kristian Moliere (The Babadook) and Bianca Martino also produce.This time around it’s a family of American tourists who wander innocently into Taylor’s hunting grounds. When the parents sacrifice themselves to save their children, the kids find themselves alone, lost and hunted in the vast Australian wilderness. Will this fresh prey – two wily, resourceful Zoomers – prove harder for the ageing predator to consume?",
