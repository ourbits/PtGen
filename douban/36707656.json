    "introduction": "On the day Dong-geun is released from prison, Director Yoon of the financial investment company introduces him to meet the CEO of Butter Cream Bread Entertainment. Butter(CEO) tells Dong-geun that his artists are naive and easy to rip off, and that there is a small “culture and arts fund” that he can use for his benefit. Dong-geun accepts Butter's suggestion and meets ‘What's Up’, one of Butter’s new artists. As it turns out, Dong-geun is a bizarre musician who sang 'Woman in the Rain' under the name of DG in the past. Dong-geun begins to have a heart for ‘What's Up’ and slowly regains the passion he had as DG in the past. Dong-geun finally decides to help 'What's Up'.",
