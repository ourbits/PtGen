The IMF recruits a former fighter whose hands were ruined for boxing because of his military service. Barney trains as a boxer, assuming the former fighter's identity. Barney attracts the interest of the crooked promoter and is scheduled to box in a demonstration fight. Phelps, who is installing \"special\" equipment for the demonstration match is about to be discovered when hoods working for the crooked promoter return to the gym where the fight will take place.",
