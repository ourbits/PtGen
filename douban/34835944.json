    "introduction": "For decades, foremost documentarian Nick Broomfield (Kurt & Courtney) has often implicated himself in his filmmaking with honesty and candor. Yet never has he made a movie more distinctly personal than this complex, moving film about his relationship with his father Maurice, an accomplished photographer of industrial post-WWII England. Both memoir and tribute, My Father and Me is an intimate story of one family that also takes an expansive, philosophical look at the 20th Century.",
