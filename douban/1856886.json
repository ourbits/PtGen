    "introduction": "A live-action Czech film version of this story was made in 1979. The film was directed by Vladimir Bychkov. It starred Vyctoriya Novikova as the little mermaid and Yuri Senkevich as the prince.\nIn this version, the mermaid does not have to give up her voice to the sea witch, but instead exchange her beautiful long hair for a pair of human legs. In order to return home to her family under the sea, someone has to kill the prince and/or sacrifice himself for her sake in which case she'll appear as only a memory to the prince while everyone else has forgotten she existed.",
