    "introduction": "Events began in 1965, some 13 years after the end of the inter-Korean war, when Jenkins abandoned his post in South Korea and walked across the militarized border into North Korea. He believed his action would get him back to the U.S. and earn him a short jail sentence. Instead, he found himself in another sort of prison, living for 40 years under a repressive Communist autocracy. The continuing tale reveals the inner workings of the North Korean hermit kingdom and is a powerful testament to the human survival instinct.",
