    "introduction": "Germany team: Gottfried Leibniz, Immanuel Kant, Friedrich Hegel (captain), Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Schelling, Franz Beckenbauer, Karl Jaspers, Karl Schlegel, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger.Greek team: Platon, Epictetus, Aristoteles, Sophocles, Empedocles, Plotinus, Epicurus, Heraklitus, Democritus, Socrates (captain) and Archimedes.In the game, instead of playing football, the philosophers played in a circle while thinking about philosophy, which confused Franz Beckenbauer, the only true footballer. In the match Nietzsche was shown a yellow card after criticizing the referee – Confucius. The only goal of the match was scored by Socrates in the 89th minute with a header from a cross from Archimedes. Karl Marx objected to the goal because he thought Socrates was in offside.",
