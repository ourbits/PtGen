    "introduction": "首部由比阿维州投资实地拍摄的电影长片，比阿维州地处巴西内陆深处，号称是全国最穷的一个州。不过这部以魔幻写实风格为主的超现实电影却很不错的说。推荐一看。CIPRIANO, the first in a long line movie of Piauí state, conceived and produced by filmmaker Douglas Machado. It catches and holds one's attention throughout, odd because it tells about absurdly natural and supernatural realities, so normal and regular to the surrealistic imagination of the Sertao (interior). Mystical modernism ! In its visual anthropology and beauty involving the audience faithfully in the world of Cipriano, a man who dreams his death.Two brothers, Bigail and Vicente, living in the backcountry of the State of Piauí, an arid and hostile environment, decide to take their father Cipriano's dead body to be buried in a very faraway cemetery by the sea, since the old man, a former cowboy, dreamed of knowing the sea. In their way, they meet the Death, three Guardian Angels and two demons. First feature film entirely produced in the State of Piauí, perhaps Brazil's poorest State.",
