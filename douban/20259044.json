    "introduction": "In 'Ghost Of Old Highways' a man pursued by an invading army hunts down previous versions of himself amidst the purgatory of a fractured consciousness. The experiential short film is driven by an original score from the artist Lovett, whose song of the same name inspired the script from director Dan Bush. Shot on location deep in the North Carolina mountains, the surreal narrative is set against the distorted dreamscape of the Civil War, a time when this country had turned against itself and into its own worst enemy. The film explores the identity of the hero in the collective American psyche and the inherent struggle within to reconcile the choices one must make while being chased by the ghost of past ones.",
