    "introduction": "The Death Coast is an area of rough sea in the North Atlantic that’s claimed more than six thousand vessels across centuries. Many sailors braved these waters – some for trade, some for war, and some for plunder. Gold and priceless objects from their wrecked ships now lie scattered across the ocean floor but salvaging has been banned here for the last decade. Now, after a long battle, shipwreck hunter Jeff Mackinnon has won exclusive rights to dive. He and his team have just 12 weeks to search the wrecks before the turbulent waters of the Death Coast make diving impossible.",
