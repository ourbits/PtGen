    "introduction": "A woman who is about to die calls the town's priest and hands him a scapulary, saying that she knows of its great powers. Anybody who does not believe in them will end up dead.Great classic Mexican cinema. Its about the power of a scapular and its passage between brothers finally arriving to an old lady. As she lies in the death bed she gives the scapular to the village priest. After, the priest leaves the house he wants to go back only to find that the house had be abandoned for many years and that the lady had already been dead for some time. The movie is in black and white. It can get a little on the creepy side as well. The style in the production is not used anymore by Mexican cinema. In the 80s the production values changed. Most movies started being about drug trafficking and sexual content. This was a disregard to actual story line.",
