Picking up where he left off after high school, he tries to leave his failed career behind and return to an easier, more exciting time in his life. But recapturing youth turns out to be more complicated than he imagined, and he finds that the harder he pursues adventure and escape, the more they elude him. His journey touches on questions of masculinity, confidence, and identity as they play out through friendship, romance, and the desire to be someone else.",
