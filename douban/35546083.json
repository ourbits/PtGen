    "introduction": "In 2006, we were shocked by the story of Gisberta Salce Jr., a Brazilian transgender woman living in extreme social exclusion in the Portuguese city of Porto. She was homeless, used drugs and was HIV positive; she was tortured and sexually abused for days and then brutally murdered by a group of 14 teenagers. This animated documentary collects testimonies from Gisberta’s friends and two of those involved in the case, presenting different perspectives on what happened in those dark days. After “Surprise” (Curtas Audience Award 2017), a touching animated documentary based on a recorded conversation between a mother and her 3-year-old daughter recovering from cancer, Paulo Patrício is back to Curtas with another pertinent and sensitive film that gives room to unheard voices. Far from the “soundbite culture” of most mainstream news media, Patrício uses his film as an opportunity to broaden the reflection on gender and sexual discrimination - an issue still so entrenched in the Portuguese society.",
