    "introduction": "London Overground retraces legendary London writer Iain Sinclair's journey with film-maker Andrew Kötting around the Overground railway for the book of the same name. The film follows Sinclair reprising the walk over the course of a year rather than the day's walk of the book. Sinclair describes the 'Ginger Line' as the 'spin-drier of capitalism whirling bank notes around the city - a real moment to look at this city of unreal money' where a new city is emerging. The recently completed Overground circuit provides 'a tiny little map of what is happening now' in London. What emerges from the film is a snapshot of the city in transition and also a unique insight into the most important chronicler of contemporary Londoner. 'The city' Sinclair says at one point, 'is a series of psychic mappings that reinforce our own identity'.",
