    "introduction": "On a winter night in Berlin, Three of Cups unfolds as a poetic exploration of love, identity, and transformation between three friends: a non-binary artist, a trans woman, and a queer straight man. Blending documentary and fiction, the short film captures fleeting, intimate moments as these characters navigate their poly amorous connections. Through private conversations and unspoken glances, their relationships reveal Marzipan and Grace's deep, oceanic bond, Grace and Thomas's fiery passion, and the tentative curiosity sparking between Marzipan and Thomas. Set against a backdrop of poetry and reflection, Three of Cups celebrates how transient encounters shape who we are becoming.",
