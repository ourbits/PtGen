    "introduction": "影片故事来自米兰-昆德拉的短篇小说，由Pavel Jurácek和导演Hynek Bocan共同执笔改编，是捷克新浪潮电影中的一部重要作品。获1965年德国曼海姆-海登堡国际电影节金奖。In this Czech comedy, an art critic is hounded by a determined man who wishes to publish his manuscript about a famous artist. When the critic receives the author's work, he sends a letter wishing the man luck without reading a single page. The determined author forces the art critic to tell him what he thinks of his manuscript. In the meantime, the writer loses his job, his girlfriend, and falls out of favor with the Communist Party before learning his literary efforts are no good.Czech filmmaker Hynek Bocan largely eschewed the conventions of his country's New Wave cinema in favor of making well-crafted, traditional literary adaptations. A graduate of his native Prague's prestigious FAMU in 1961, Bocan started out working at the Barrandov Film Studio, assisting such filmmakers as Karel Kachyna, Jan Nemec, and Jiri Weiss. In addition to directing, Bocan collaborated on the screenplays of all of his films. He made his directorial debut with Nikdo se Nebude Smat/No Laughing Matter (1965). In 1969, while working on his third film, Pastak/The Decoy, Bocan encountered political differences with his government and was prevented from completing the production; it was not until 1990 that the film was finished and released. Unable to work in features, Bocan turned to television to co-write and direct the nine-episode series Zahada Hlavolau/The Mystery of a Brain Teaser. In 1974, Bocan was allowed to return to filmmaking, and he released Muz z Lonyna/The Man From London. Bocan has subsequently divided his time between feature films and television.",
