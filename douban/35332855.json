    "introduction": "Raised as a tomboy during the 1990s in China and now living in Berlin, 32-year-old Viv faces an existential crisis she didn’t know existed. In every corner of her life, nuanced clashes arise between the progressive German city and Viv’s conservative upbringing. Following her curious but clumsy exploration of gender, sexuality, and artistic identity, the film takes a witty, sharp look at what it means to feel a sense of belonging in a globalized world.",
