    "introduction": "John and Carol are having trouble selling their house when young father Ryan,after a row with his wife,steps off the kerb outside and is killed by a taxi. The area in front of the house becomes a shrine as Ryan's widow Sarah and well-wishers leave flowers and cards but prospective buyers find this off-putting,seeing the road as dangerous. John and Carol hide the flowers when a couple come to view and are accused of selfishness by Sarah. However Carol tells Sarah she feels she is dining out on public shows of grief and should remember Ryan in her heart,not through a shrine. This heals the breach as Sarah offers Carol and John some of the flowers.",
