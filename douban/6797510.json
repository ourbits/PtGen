    "introduction": "Tenzin is a pious and an enterprising businessman loved and adored by his wife Peydey. The couple is doing extremely well when Tenzin is murdered by his elder brother Wangdue under the influence of Kardon, Wangdue's wife, who has excessive greed for wealth. The murder was committed in such a fashion that no one could have the slightest doubt. Tenzin's soul now exists in \"bardo\" (a sort of Buddhist intermediate state in the afterlife) and discovers the dreadful plans of his brother and the sister-in-law to murder his pregnant wife Peydey in order to take possession of all his wealth.",
