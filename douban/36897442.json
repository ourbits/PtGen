    "introduction": "Symphony of Suffering is a showcase of shorts from some of the most prominent filmmakers within the fetish-gore sub-genre. An anthology with films from Jonathan Doe (Erotic Grotesque Nonsense trilogy), Jack Mulvanerty (Scarlet Piss Princess), White Gardenia (Mutilation Theater), and Blucifer (Putrid Menstrual Slime). With the feature scored to the Hurrian Hymn to Nikkal, the oldest known melody in recorded history; Symphony of Suffering attempts to showcase that the intertwining of pain and art are just as deeply infused and rooted in human expression as the origin of music itself. Jonathan Doe's \"Lost & Found\" Blucifer's \"Sakura\" White Gardenia's \"Thalia and Melponeme\" Jack Mulvanerty's \"Can Carry No Weight\"",
