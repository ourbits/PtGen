    "introduction": "The dramedy, penned by Jean Pasley and the director herself, was inspired by Anne Gildea’s memoir “I’ve Got Cancer, What’s Your Excuse?” and follows the vicissitudes of a thirty-something stand-up comedian called Kate McLaughin (played by the versatile Gemma-Leah Devereux, who recently appeared in Paddy Slattery’s crime flick Broken Law [+]). The woman spends her days almost apathetically and tries to find meaning and direction in life. She has developed a troubled relationship with her mother and her late father, but seems to be in more peaceful terms with her brother. One day, a shocking news seems to disrupt Kate’s existence even more; she is diagnosed with breast cancer and, after a clumsy but still risky overdose attempt, she reluctantly decides to undergo chemotherapy.",
