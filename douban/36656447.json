    "introduction": "Upon his release from prison, Mansour Omari, a Syrian POW and torture survivor, risked his life by writing the names of his fellow cellmates in blood and rust on scraps of cloth and sewing them into his shirt. The film follows Omari, now in exile, as he travels to Holocaust memorial sites in Germany and reflects on how to bring attention to the brutal regime he escaped. Along with the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, he is preparing to display the cloths so that the names of his 82 cellmates will not be forgotten. Warning: Graphic images.",
