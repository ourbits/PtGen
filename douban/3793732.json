    "introduction": "Resorting to both documentary and fiction, Isaki Lacuesta evokes, in his first feature film, the mysterious figure of Arthur Cravan, grandson of Oscar Wilde, poet, boxer, adventurer and one of the most fascinating characters of the 20th century, who disappeared in 1918, at the age of 30, when he was sailing through the Gulf of Mexico. The film, which contains a lot of phantasmagorical images of the time like the life of Cravan, uses an intelligent narrative artifice that turns it into a detective game: the narrator is also a boxer and a poet.",
