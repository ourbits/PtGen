    "introduction": "The Twilight World will be the first animated feature directed by Werner Herzog. Based on Herzog's best selling novel, the film tells the true story of Hiroo Onoda, a World War II Japanese intelligence officer who refused to surrender and continued to fight a personal, fictitious war in the jungles of the Philippines. For thirty years. Part fictionalized history, part drama and part dream log, The Twilight World is a meditation on the nature of reality, the illusion of time, and the conflict between the external world and our inner lives.",
