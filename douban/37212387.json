    "introduction": "The film follows the life of comic and podcast pioneer Marc Maron. Loss and growth take centerstage as he struggles to evolve in the wake of deep tragedy. The passing of his partner and filmmaker Lynn Shelton weighs on Marc, as the film picks up a year later. We follow him on a self-reflective journey as he builds an hour of comedy, while processing grief both on-stage and off. It chronicles his career from the 80’s with Sam Kinison through many career obstacles that eventually led him to the legacy defining podcast WTF with Marc Maron. Looking back over his life at 60, Marc reconciles with a declining father, a changing comedy landscape and the prospect of retirement.",
