Txomin, an unemployed Basque archaeologist, receives a commission to provide an expert’s report on Mars. With his brother Gene at the wheel, they leave from Eibar on an adventure through northern Spain. When Gene’s frail health and a mysterious sudden toxic mist makes them lose their way, they turn to their sister Mila. The reunion between the three awakens old family reproaches as Gene’s health continues to decline. With the help of a few ghosts and of Jesus Christ himself, the two brothers decide to complete their mission and make it to Mars.",
