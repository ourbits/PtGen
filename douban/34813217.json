    "introduction": "\"A monument to the Tlatelolco student massacre of 1968 in Mexico City, ten days before the Olympics. Hundred of students were disappeared. A grotesque tradition - the complete physical obliteration of students organizing for progressive change - was hurled into motion. This film is nearly wordless. In place of words, the enactment of violence against the images themselves, in a stagger towards commensurate aesthetics. Produced in collaboration with UNAM Filmoteca and Catedra Bergman UNAM.”",
