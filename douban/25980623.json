    "introduction": "The film’s loose plot involves an adolescent girl named Albertine (Franssou Prenant) dealing with an unplanned pregnancy. Despite the tough material, the tone is light-hearted and irreverent, with the children visibly enjoying their various social transgressions, whether shocking their parents at home, mocking their jailers while in police custody, or wresting control of the classroom from their teacher.",
