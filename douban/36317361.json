    "introduction": "The summer season at the camp starts with the traditional Friday demonstration against the local power plant’s wasteful management of groundwater. Best friends Zuzana (18) and Dominik (22) are planning their next steps to be taken against water pollution felt. Zuzana’s summer routine is disturbed by a letter of acceptance from the university to study meteorology. Instead spending one last peaceful month together, the friends succumb to their misguided decisions. Zuzana doesn’t dare ruin her parents’ plans for the family camp, Dominik “sells out” his voice to the power plant, Lucy (19) deals with another year just by herself without father who works abroad. Nature has to speak for itself and make the friends come together to fight for their goals.",
