    "introduction": "Certainly one of the more obscure adaptations, here is a film that may be overlooked by even the most thorough film scholar. It takes place shortly after the Third Crusade. While returning home from the war, King Richard the Lionhearted is captured by the Germans and held for ransom. While he is being imprisoned, his conniving brother, Prince John, takes control of the regency and plans to oust Richard from the throne. Meanwhile, Robin Hood and his men are trying to collect enough money to get their king back from the Germans. However, the evil sheriff of Nottingham, Baron Elwin, attempts to stop them. Various plots and sub-plots abound in this film, which is very good at times. The only drawback I can think of is its annoying slapstick elements, which seem to detract from the overall enjoy-ability of the film; albeit, not too much!",
