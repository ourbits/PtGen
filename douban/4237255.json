    "introduction": "this movie is basically flawless. as a CHILD, i watched the English version and was enthralled by it, and at the same time very creeped out by the incredibly and shockingly sexual predator/stalker character of the Wolf. Anyone who has seen this film as a child can tell you it is an emotional roller coaster on multiple levels. The music, the rustic scenery in \"half color\", and the emotions just take you to another world; an outsider who is just waiting to see the protagonist come to an end, with the evil being so pungent and in our face, with you completely unable to do anything about it. You constantly fear for riding hood and the villagers because you know what is coming for them. its very shakespearan.As an ADULT, the movie is the most hilarious thing you will perhaps ever see in you're life, for various reasons, primarily the corniness and high levels of non realism. It is worthe minutes upon minutes of laughter. However, It is also possible to take the film very seriously; just note the above mentioned characteristics of the wolf. Strong other gender and age related issues are also prevalent throughout the film; its a matter of viewing it as styalistic.",
