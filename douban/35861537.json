    "introduction": "The film shows the fascination Salvador Dalí always had for Millet's painting The Angelus, which led him to write an essay entitled The Tragic Myth of the Angelus, published in 1963. Based on this premise, the film delves into the intriguing and mysterious painter through his years researching the origins of the painting, which concealed a dark and tragic secret.The plot of the film tells the story of how, while organising a surprise birthday party for one of his friends - a spectacle typical of the 1960s, with swans, dancers and music by Rimsky Korsakov - Dalí is visited by a journalist who wants to interview him about one of the most intriguing periods of his life: the sudden reappearance of an essay that the painter had written more than 20 years earlier and which had been lost when he fled from France, after the Nazis invaded.",
