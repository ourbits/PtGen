    "introduction": "In an age where domestic wine making had a series of failures in the difference between European climate and soil, a group of young people learned and grew from the ideals of Asai Usuke, a pioneer in Japanese wine. Okamura quits his job and plans to make wine by renting some land to raise grapes with the help of Itoh and Uemera and other college classmates. Meanwhile, Shiroyama starts cultivating wine grapes at a fruit grape farm owned by his wife's family. Taking over his family winery, Takayama overcomes his parent's objection to him raising wine grapes. Undertaking Asai's wine training, they start to make wine. The main actor Dai Watanabe is a son of Ken Watanabe who nominated Academy Awards and Tony Award.ワイン・コンサルタント・麻井宇介の影響下にある、山梨大学大学院の三人の修士たち「ウスケボーイズ」が、卒業後、離れ離れになりながらも応援しあい、優れたワインを作り出せるようになるまでの成長の軌跡。",
