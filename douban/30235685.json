    "introduction": "The comeback of Detroit is poised to be the greatest turnaround story of American history. American Dream: Detroit illustrates why the history and the future of Detroit matters in the global landscape. Grammy winning singer Michael Bolton celebrates the golden age of Detroit - featuring its native entertainment legends like Francis Ford Coppola, Jerry Bruckheimer, Aretha Franklin, Smokey Robinson, Alice Cooper, John Varvatos and many more - and reveals the landscape of the new Detroit being built by young visionaries as well as entrepreneurial moguls. Told through the eyes of Bolton's own discovery, this important story has remained until now largely obscured by mainstream media's preference to portray only the devastation of the city's downfall. This is the story of the American Dream.",
