    "introduction": "A group of Russians, a Chinese terrorist group and a Japanese ninja are trying to capture a Japanese WWII scientist and steal his formula for germ warfare.The title character is not American, not a commando, and only just barely qualifies as a ninja. He gets sent on mission to steal back a dangerous biochemical weapon which has been stolen by an unspecified group of terrorists. Upon arriving in America (which, I might add, looks remarkably similar to what was Japan only moments earlier), he meets up with a man whom is to be ally, but at first they fight, giving the ACN a chance to show off his disappearing abilities, a special effect comprised of film cuts.At this point the plot loses me, but in all honesty the only reason I know about the chemical weapons plot part was because I read the back of the box after taking it back. I was laughing too hard and too confused by the mixture of bad acting and incredible cheapness to follow what tiny plot there was. The unintentional laughs are plentiful. Boggle as you witness a \"ninja\" (!?) in bright lime green slacks and flowery shirt sneak into a building. Recoil in terror as you realize that the filmmakers could only afford ONE blank bullet for the entire end sequence.",
