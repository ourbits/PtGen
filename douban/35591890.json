    "introduction": "In 1979, LA club owner Steve Banerjee gambled on an unlikely idea to attract a week-night crowd: male strippers. Over the next decade, the Chippendales became a global phenomenon, selling out stadiums around the world and redefining notions of masculinity and female desire. But behind the G-strings and the good times lies an astonishing tale of professional rivalry, arson and murder. Jesse Vile’s outrageously enjoyable documentary series is at once layered sociocultural history, gripping true-crime investigation and a carnival of boogying beefcake. Featuring fantastic archive footage and a colourful cast list of former Chippendales, Playboy Bunnies and FBI agents, this is a wild ride into the dark heart of the American fantasy factory. Consider this your homework before the forthcoming feature starring Dev Patel.",
