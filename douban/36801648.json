    "introduction": "In a world on the brink of collapse, Jacques, a taciturn giant, lives in isolation surrounded by abandoned objects that he has repaired. Jacques does not suffer from loneliness because, since childhood, he has had a unique ability: he can communicate with objects! Jacques discovers that a radical scientist despises humanity and its materialism to the extent of exterminating all forms of life outside of plants and insects. Forced to take a stand for humans, Jacques allies himself with a fierce orphan, a rebellious runaway, and a woman fighting for her independence. In this urban odyssey, they initiate the awakening of a new society: reuse objects and respecting all living beings.",
