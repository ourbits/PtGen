    "introduction": "VR Free (We Are Free) is a short VR documentary which explores the nature of incarceration spaces by portraying some fractions of life inside the Turin prison. The film also captures the reaction of few inmates during their brief encounter with immersive videos of life outside of prison. By using VR headsets, the prisoners get to virtually participate in some public and intimate situations, which are no longer within their reach.",
