    "introduction": "The Mountain Troop is the most powerful in the kingdom, and it lives in the best location. That is where Bobo is born. From the moment of his birth, Bobo is at the very pinnacle of troop hierarchy and is treated like a prince. But a territorial war between two rival troops changes his life forever. Once his princely status comes to an abrupt end, he has little choice but to find a new home. Somewhere between fact and fiction, The Monkey Prince delves into the destiny of a remarkable monkey and reveals the private lives of two rival troops by showing their territorial wars and their interaction with human and natural worlds.",
