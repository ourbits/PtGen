And it's not an entirely sad occasion. \"That wretched little man,\" she says. \"He's always been so much trouble. How is it Miss Marple has never upset me at all, not ever?\" That night, who should appear at her doorstep but the wretched little man himself, Hercule Poirot? The great fictional detective and his creator proceed to play a very Christie-like game of cat and mouse for the manuscript - and for their own lives.",
