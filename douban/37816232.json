    "introduction": "It took another ruined Christmas dinner to make Martha finally realize that her kids are jerks. Her daughter Penny is a 42-year-old bully who's still letting having been Prom Queen go to her head. Penny's brother Danny, 57, is a scam artist who owes the state more than he could get for selling his organs. To top it off, Martha's husband has washed his hands of the whole mess. While she's sweeping up the shattered china, he's upstairs watching \"It's a Wonderful Life\" in his underwear. But this Christmas, Martha has had enough. With help from her grandson Sully, Martha is determined to make each of her family members face their ghosts of Christmas past. Will three surprise guests inspire them to turn their lives around? Or will this gift be a Pandora's Box she can't re-wrap? And what happens when Martha gets a taste of her own Christmas medicine? Find out whether Martha's plans will bring her family together or truly tear them all apart. Either way it is sure to be a very odd American Christmas.",
