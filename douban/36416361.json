Fed up with Elizabeth’s unprofessional antics, her soon-to-be father-in-law sends her back to her hometown during the holiday season to convince an old flame, Randy (Ryan Hansen), to sell his ski resort to the firm in order to keep her job. Randy agrees to sell, but only if she can win the town’s annual winter challenge, which includes outrageous and fun ski events. Aggravating her plans further, she must face off against the perennial champion, her estranged sister (Amy Smart), now more determined than ever to ‘out-sleigh’ her rivals!",
