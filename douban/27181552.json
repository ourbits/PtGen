    "introduction": "Greta and Achille, two similar souls, a great endless love.  Achille follows the life, the passion. Greta follows Achille. They step through the chapters of their life from 80s to now by holding their hands, having deep breathes of their adolescence, still being “one for each other”; until they reach their adulthood, and then they decide to follow their own roads. Greta will make her dream of being wife and mother come true; Achille will see his dream of traveling and living a bohemian life as a reality, in an eternal conflict between love and passion. It’s the story of two persons and their very strong relationship.",
