    "introduction": "In its subject matter, the film is similar to other pictures of the black series. In its attitude or tone, it is rather like apoetic ballad. Once again we are able to see a landscape with ruins, but it is now taken out of the frame of journalistic intervention. Instead of accusation, the tone of reflection prevails. \"Like rust the ruins come to life with dull and silent obstinacy. What makes those people exist? Is it perhaps the love to their birthplace?\"",
