    "introduction": "Once the war is over, life becomes life again. But everything has to be done. During this degree-zero and in this crucial time, the young Zvonimir Jurić shot his first film, a powerful poem about the city of Osijek, but one of many other cities at the same time. An art testimony of great value about the people that faced a devastated present and an uncertain future; a film about their return to everyday life, their frustrations, their expectations and their escape from reality.",
