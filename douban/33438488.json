The premium cable network has put in development Intercepted, a soapy drama from 50 Cent and his G-Unit Films and Television, with Anthony attached to star and executive produce.Intercepted is based on Alexa Martin’s bestselling novel of the same name. It is the first of the three-book series The Playbook, inspired by the eight years Martin spent as an NFL wife.Described as a funny and fresh contemporary romance, Intercepted centers on Marlee Harper (Anthony), who is the perfect girlfriend. She’s sure had enough practice, dating her NFL-star boyfriend for the last 10 years. But when her relationship unexpectedly ends, she vows to never date an athlete again. Only one problem: Gavin Pope, the new star quarterback in town, has Marlee in his sights.",
