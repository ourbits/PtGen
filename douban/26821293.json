    "introduction": "A fascinating documentary dialogue evolved over the course of thirty months between renowned filmmaker Pavel Štingl and one of the iconic figures of Czech modern art, sculptor and painter Jaroslav Róna. It was during this time that one of the ten largest bronze equestrian statues in the world – today situated in Brno – gradually came into being. A film contemplating the sculpture itself, things material and abstract, the essence of creative endeavour, and the courage of the artist to fulfil his vision.",
