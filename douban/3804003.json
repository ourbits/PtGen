From its modest beginnings in the earliest days of the republic to the landmark decision in Marbury v. Madison, and from establishment of the \"separate but equal\" doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson to its reversal in Brown v. Board of Education, the Supreme Court has been integral to the course of events in America's history. THE SUPREME COURT, featuring exclusive interviews with Chief Justice John Roberts and retired Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, tells the story of this most important of legal and political institutions from its inception to the present day.THE SUPREME COURT originally aired on PBS stations in January and February 2007.",
