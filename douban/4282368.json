    "introduction": "\"The fact is there was nothing faked about Malcolm's catastrophic decline into mental illness. Nor was there anything essentially false in the portrayal of how a not-so-old man suffered and died in a way many people die in this country every day.\"...Watson's style doesn't allow for much context but the Alzheimer's Society estimates that 700,000 people in the UK currently suffer from dementia. And that one in three of us will experience it in some form before we die. What Watson's film indisputably and unflinchingly put the spotlight on was the sheer living hell of this condition. Not just for its victims but for their carers as well. A sacrifice that goes shamefully unrecognised in the level of NHS support made available to them, as Barbara Pointon continues to campaign to a world that rarely wants to listen.\"",
