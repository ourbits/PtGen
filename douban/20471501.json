    "introduction": "Described by Eric Idle as \"Oscar Wilde on acid or like Downton Abbey, only funnier,\" What About Dick? begins with the birth of a sex toy invented in Shagistan in 1898 by Deepak Obi Ben Kingsley (EDDIE IZZARD), tells the story of the decline of the British Empire as seen through the eyes of a Piano (ERIC IDLE) and the story of young Dick (RUSSELL BRAND), his two cousins (JANE LEEVES & SOPHIE WINKLEMAN) and their dipsomaniac Aunt Maggie (TRACEY ULLMAN), who all live together in Kensington in a large, rambling, Edwardian novel. And there too are the Reverend Whoopsie (TIM CURRY), the incomprehensible Scottish Inspector McGuffin (BILLY CONNOLLY) and Sergeant Ken Russell (JIM PIDDOCK) and the case of the Houndsditch Mutilator.Idle calls What About Dick \"a hybrid.\" Its got elements of a musical - we have songs. Its got elements of a play, but it’s not a play that you have to take completely seriously because it’s sort of a send up. It has bits of stand up and improv and these hilarious comedians are playing multiple roles and doing impersonations\".",
