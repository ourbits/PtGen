    "introduction": "Criminal melodrama. Oleg, young and talanted restorer made a copy of Van Dake's picture and saled it as an original for 300 thousand dollars. To avoid an investigation and meeting with his aggrieved buyer called \"Soloist\", Oleg conceals himself in a psychiatric facility. \"Soloist\" kidnaped him to pique to remember where the money is hidden. Katka taken into \"Soloist's\" service to watch Oleg surprisingly saves him.Tigran Keosayan was born in Moscow in 1966. He worked as an assistant director at the Mosfilm studio since 1983 and in 1998 he graduated as a director from State Film Institute (class of Yu. Ozerov). While still a student, he has shot a number of adverts, as well as music videos, charming the film world by his pectorals. Everything seemed equally easy to him: a comedy (The president and his Granddaughter), a thriller (Katka and Shiz), a war film (Men's Job), an ironic melodrama (A Silver Snowdrop). Everything was very professional and the only thing missing was a soul, without which these films were fun to watch and quite easy to forget. It made him turn around and go yet in another direction, into his own past, to make, almost for the first time in the Russian cinema, an impossible blend of a political farce and a poetic tale. It took him to the roads of , riding in a gipsy cart and accompanied by Alexei Rybnikov's wonderful music. Weather the director has managed to find that mysterious soul in his travels remains to be seen in his future films.",
