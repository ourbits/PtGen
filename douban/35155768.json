    "introduction": "'Wisper' is the true of the murder of a middle-class African American family. In June 2016, three children and their mother were found shot to death at their suburban home in Northern New Jersey, and discovered by father and husband Josiah Wisper - a brash businessman who owned bars, restaurants and real estate in Harlem, N.Y. Josiah Wisper was eventually ruled out as a suspect by law enforcement officials, but never in the eyes of those in his community, the people he had known for nearly half his life. Josiah quickly embarks on a search to find out who killed his family. His personal video recordings and diaries take us to family, friends, police precincts, newspapers, drug dens, and street-gang hangouts - all in the hope of piecing together the clues needed to solve this tragic crime. Wisper's \"on-camera\" journey takes us on a roller-coaster ride of emotions leading to a shocking conclusion - and Josiah's final discovery of what it takes to be a man. 'Wisper' is inspired by true events, and is directed by Russ Emanuel and produced by Howard Nash.",
