    "introduction": "At a public and white-walled hospice, sadly, patients like the terminally ill, Mr Nowak, are left to face death all alone, abandoned at death's door. Under those circumstances, Sharon, an inexperienced, yet devoted young nurse, is trying her best during her very first graveyard shift in the short-staffed facility, even though, right from the start, a strange feeling of pulsating malevolence within the quiet and endless corridors, chills the bone to the marrow. Is it because the soft nurse previously witnessed a tragic passing on a man's deathbed? Either way, Sharon needs to toughen up, after all, the night is still very young.",
