Created only by her mother, she experiences, in the body and bodies of her descendants, the marks of a war that never ended: the war for the land. Woven from Edna's reports and writings in the notebook she titled The Story of My Life, the hybrid narrative transitions between real and imaginary, through guerrillas, disappearances and deforestation, but also by the strength of women, rivers and forests that insist on surviving .",
