    "introduction": "About perspective-theatres, folding dioramas, stereo-pictures and much more.Besides perspective, movement and montage, space is a further early experimental area in visual art. It reaches from pop-art books or extensions of the picture space in postcards up to optical prisma, verre eglomisé pictures and depth relief pictures.Picture worlds in peep-shows are stacked in several layers, and thus make space visible.The folding diorama is developed from the perspective-theatre and shows places and events on multilevels placed one behind the other.Stereo pictures separate what is seen by the left eye form what is seen by right eye in two slightly different pictures. These are then blended together by a mirror, a stereoscope or polarisation spectacles.Holography promises three-dimensional films without spectacles.",
