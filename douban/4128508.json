    "introduction": "So much has been said about the turbulent life and phenomenal career of Michael Jackson that it has become almost impossible to disentangle the man from the myth. More than any other icon in history of popular music, Michael Jackson remained a charismatic but elusive figure of heated debate. But one fact will forever remain undisputed: his extraordinary talent for creating truly original music, loved by millions. And despite setbacks that would have ended careers of lesser men, Michael Jackson's accomplishments as the King of Pop will remain some of the most impressive in music history.Featuring candid contributions from Janet Jackson, Brooke Shields, Quincy Jones, Sheryl Crow, Diana Ross and rare, behind-the-scenes footage, this documentary looks into the life of one of the most enigmatic and flamboyant pop stars of our time.",
