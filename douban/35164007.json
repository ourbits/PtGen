    "introduction": "Tania and Daniela are two cousins who have maintained a close and intimate relationship throughout their lives. Both married, the cousins confess that they live in a strange situation, their husbands are good and kind to them, they enjoy a good social and economic position, but they have fallen into a routine and monotony, appearing apathetic and bored in their days. During a wedding, after much drinking they both have an idea to get out of the nuisance: swapping their husbands, playing at being involved with another man, and going home with them. On the way back, one of the new couples suffers from a terrible car accident, ending their lives. Now, the surviving couple has a strange new relationship, moving between the guilt and the emptiness that the loss of their respective partners has left them.",
