    "introduction": "Divided in three chapters, this film explores the iconic actor, writer, director, author and activist Liv Ullmann’s multifaceted life, and her extraordinary international career spanning over 66 years. This is the story of an ever-evolving human being full of openness and curiosity, who embraces possibilities and uncertainties, demonstrates what it means to be a woman in a male-dominated world and shows how to find and use one’s voice without losing one’s integrity, sense of humour or friends. Using intimate contributions from some of Liv’s close companions, such as Cate Blanchett, Jessica Chastain, Lena Endre, Pernilla August, Jeremy Irons, John Lithgow, Sam Waterston, John Lahai, Tom Remlov, Kjell Erik Øie and Michał Leszczyłowski, the film delves deep into the core values underneath Liv’s universal appeal and longevity and celebrates one of the world’s most respected and revered artists in the world.",
