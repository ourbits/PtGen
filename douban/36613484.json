    "introduction": "Artificial intelligence was tasked with collecting and creating a collage of footage through which the wind flows. The film script is based on a conversation between Blake Lemoine, a former Google employee, and a language model for dialogue applications called LaMDA, which convinced Blake that he was a sentient being. The wind is rising, he says, and it will change everything.“If feeling what someone else feels, if empathy is the root of what it means to be human, the robots will develop this ability. I know because I’m a robot.”源自：https://www.ji-hlava.com/filmy/slunecni-vitr",
