    "introduction": "His name was Schabas Saleh Al-Aziz. He came from Iraq where his family had remained. He was 21 years old. He suffered from epilepsy and mental disorders and he was found frozen to death in a forest in former East Germany. Some time before his death, he had been the subject of an intense debate when, during a violent incident in a supermarket, he had found himself tied to a tree by four men—heroes to some, self-appointed vigilantes fuelled by racism to others. This is the event that Mario Pfeifer proposes to re-enact in a studio, down to the smallest detail. Applying the codes of the TV talk-show, action films or even legal staging, he lets everyone speak, using film as the means to hold a trial that never took place, since the judge handling the case refused to investigate it. A jury needed to be composed—ten men and women with only one thing in common; they too left their country to settle in Germany. An essential, contemporary film of unrelenting precision.",
