    "introduction": "On a bucolic farm in Upstate New York, a farmer is in crisis: after years of raising pigs, he can no longer bear the ultimate act of betrayal. Unable to ignore his ethical impasse, and with 250 pigs on the farm, he sets out to change his life.Stunning cinematography captures the final year of a small-scale farmer and the pigs under his care. Deeply immersive, THE LAST PIG is a poetic snapshot, a contemplation on compassion, ethics, and the changing landscape of animal agriculture. The farmer’s inner reflections share his struggle to align life with values, and through the story’s simple intimacy, his moral quandary quietly becomes our own.With bittersweet detail, this award-winning film offers an entirely new view of small-scale livestock farming and raises crucial questions about the ethics of eating.",
