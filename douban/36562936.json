Suna’s uncle, the village headman, is on the lookout for ways to close his debt. His wife, whom he married by force, keeps eloping only to be found on the outskirts of the village each time. Twelve-year-old Filiz shoots YouTube videos, and feels that “nothing happens in this village!”. But things happen. An imam arrives and he is strange: he forgets the calls to prayer and spends his nights on the mountain. A dead girl is found in the river; conflict around the stone quarry escalates; treasure hunters arrive, and soon there is a dead body with his mouth filled with stones. Suna is the only one with the innocence and the courage to ask: “Who is to tell you what is good? Who is to tell you your path?”.",
