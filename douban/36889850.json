    "introduction": "Co-directors Tilda Swinton and Bartek Dziadosz travel the world to understand what it means to learn, and along the way uncover playful food for thought – for adults and young people alike.What does it mean to learn? Academy Award® winning actor Tilda Swinton and Bartek Dziadosz travel between the UK, Bangladesh, West Africa and North America, probing the experiences of young people and exploring the role of education in our past, present and future. Swinton plays researcher and Dziadosz filmmaker in their second feature collaboration (the first was one of the chapters of The Seasons in Quincy: The Four Portraits of John Berger). The result, produced by the Derek Jarman Lab, is a beautiful cinematic rumination. Drawing insights from scientists, farmers, philosophers, educators and children, this warm and engaging film highlights how, in a complex world, we must never stop being curious.",
