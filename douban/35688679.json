    "introduction": "The Italian unification, also known as Risorgimento, took place between 1815 and 1870. During this period, caricature was a privileged medium for political commentary. From Napoleon III to Garibaldi, no one escaped the caricaturists, who also resorted to drawing to talk about the new legal system, the emancipation of women or the freedom of the press.",
