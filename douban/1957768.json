    "introduction": "On a hot summer day, the residents of a five-story apartment complex on the outskirts of Seoul are gathered in the courtyard to escape the sweltering heat. Into their midst rushes Jeong-hui (Ha Yu-mi), who is fleeing from the latest round of her husband's constant physical abuse. When her husband Seong-gu comes after her with his fists flying, the women rally together and give him a sound beating. Unfortunately, Seong-gu dies in the ambulance on his way to the hospital, and the police try to take the neighborhood women into custody for murder. Bewildered, the women jostle to and fro before eventually finding their way to the rooftop of an apartment building. Thus, the rooftop becomes the site of a last stand for ten women, including Geyong-suk (Sohn Suk), an aspiring novelist in her late forties; Ki-sun (Lee Jin-sun), a single woman engaged in an affair with Yeong-hui's father; Yeong-hui's mother (Song Ok-suk), who consequently harbors deep resentment toward Ki-sun; Eun-ju's mother (Kim Bo-yeon), who heads the women residents' association and likes to put herself forward; Pohang-daek (Lim Hee-suk), a fifty-something woman who delivers Chinese food; Yun-hui (Jeong Seon-kyeong), who works as a hostess in a bar; and Yu-mi, a cabaret singer who has helped Jeong-hui up to the roof. The group becomes anxious when a special police strike force is deployed for their capture, but after a while they decide to take a firm stance against their would-be-captors. Just at that moment, an incompetent twosome of burglars (Lee Kyeong-young, Kim Min-jong) who were in the middle of breaking into an empty apartment see the throng of police gathered in the courtyard. They mistake themselves for the police's intended quarry and attempt to flee in terror, but end up trapped in the empty apartment, hemmed in on all sides.",
