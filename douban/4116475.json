    "introduction": "The road movie is a pure American genre, the long journey from East to West is part of the US History. In general, they are all very go od films, from stupid but laughable teen movies to masterpieces like this one. But The Dream Catcher gives us more than this : it is a very good film indeed, moving and beautiful, but the superior point is at a formal level.It's a fact that most of the American movies look alike formally (even the most independent of them), I'm not saying that Spiderman and Happiness are the same movie but you can tell they are American just by looking at them a few seconds. Then, the way The Dream Catcher was filmed is totally original, who could tell if it's a German or an American movie ?The story is American, the movie isn't.An outsider. A rarity.",
