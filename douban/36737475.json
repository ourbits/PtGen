    "introduction": "Bursting onto the comedy scene in the early 1970s, Cheech and Chong brought drugs, sex, and rock’n’roll into the oeuvre, transforming them into stand-up-icons, counterculture rock stars, and Hollywood legends. Explosively funny, their irreverent stoner humor has translated into sold-out concerts, platinum-selling records, and box-office-smashing films. How did Cheech & Chong ignite the imaginations of a global audience and maintain their relevance through 50 years (and counting) of pop culture? The first ever fully authorized Cheech & Chong documentary takes you on a poignant and hilarious journey into the lives and partnership of one of the greatest comic duos of all time.源自：https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/films/2196825",
