    "introduction": "In the afternoon, the so-called 'White Train' arrives from the suburbs in the city of Buenos Aires. Its task is to collect those whom society has tossed aside. Its passengers are men, women and children called the 'cartoneros' the 'cardboard people', and they earn their living with trash, collecting what others throw away. Day after day, the cardboard people must fight against indifference and loneliness. Jobless labourers, carpenters, barbers, bums and beggars – their life stories mingle in the White Train, where teenagers enjoy their first kisses and children play football in the empty carriages, as if the train were the only thing in their lives. El tren blanco depicts the situation suffered by a large number of Argentinians who became impoverished in recent years as a consequence of the economic and social model imposed by the political system. The documentary also shows the internal conflict that takes place inside these people, who, in spite of the social situation they endure, try to maintain their basic human dignity. Outside their world, Buenos Aires is being torn apart by riots. But the cardboard people’s only wish, apart from surviving, is to set up a train to take food to starving children, dying of malnutrition, in a northern city 1,500 kilometers away from Buenos Aires.",
