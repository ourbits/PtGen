    "introduction": "----- Synopsis taken from the book, \"Mondo Macabro\" by Pete Tombs -----The first film, simply called Zuma, shows how an archaeological dig frees the Hell Serpent from his pyramid like tomb. Zuma is a large, bald-headed green giant. But the most surprising thing about his appearance is the massive. two-headed snake permanently wrapped around his neck. Zuma hides out in the sewers under Manila. He acquires a female slave who brings him fresh victims. This, lead to lots of gory scenes with heads being pulled off, hearts being ripped out and Zuma´s neck-snakes boring holes through bodies. Eventually the gruesome green giant is captured and imprisioned under the rockfall. Meanwhile, his assistant has given birth to a baby Zuma, this time a female, who also has two hissing snakes attached to her neck. The baby girl, Galema, is brought up by a kindly archeaologist. Everyone seems to polite to mention the hideous things sticking out of her neck and she grows two extra long braids of hair to cover them. When the girl reaches pubertry, Zuma awakens and comes looking for her. The climax of the film is a long battle between Zuma and his daughter. Both end up trapped by a rockfall, leaving the way open for a sequel: Anak in Zuma - Hell Serpent (Daughter of Zuma - Hell Serpent)",
