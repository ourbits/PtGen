    "introduction": "The Dead attempts to unmask the lives of Mexico's hyper privileged youth. It draws an anatomy of money as a force that imprisons and blinds its supposed keepers to the social and political reality that envelops them. It also shows the uncomfortable friction between the Mexico where nothing happens, and the Mexico in which too many things happen. The crux of this controversy leads to an unexpected accident which opens the possibility for redemption in the heart of Mexico's horror.",
