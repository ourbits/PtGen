    "introduction": "Angela and Franca decide to take the dream trip of their lives. They run away from their boring retirement home in Rome and make a daring getaway to fabulous Venice in this joyous, heart-warming on-the-road adventure where anything can – and does – happen.Italian screen icon Claudia Cardinale (8 ½ 1963, Once Upon a Time in the West 1968) plays Angela, a fallen Duchess who is as outspoken as she is irreverent. Her glorious past is only a dim memory though, since she has lost all her fortune at the races and casino tables. Comedic actress Nunzia Schiano, (Welcome to the South LIFF11) is Franca, an honest and open, though sometimes a little naïve, nonna from Naples. She has spent all of her life in her restaurant cooking.The two ladies have been best friends for years – both are uninhibited, romantic, naughty, bursting with life and crazy ideas. And when they disappear on their surprise escape, the people they thought did not care about them anymore suddenly realise how incredible they truly are.AUSTRALIAN PREMIEREDIRECTORLaszlo BarboCASTClaudia Cardinale, Nunzia Schiano, Edoardo Pesce, Ilenia Pastorelli, Daphne Scoccia, Jordi MollàCOMEDY | ITALY | 2017 | 87 MINItalian and English with English subtitles",
