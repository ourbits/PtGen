Their files in the archives of the State Security and the diary of her childhood reveal the complicated fate of the actress rushing to the big stage and her \"second life\" imposed by the system. Torn by doubts that his life was conducted, false, he relives once again, in his loneliness, their love and career, trying to find his place in this life puzzle. The film is based on key moments of real creative and personal history of a Bulgarian singer, very famous in the middle of the last century.",
