    "introduction": "《背蓝书包的小女孩》是墨西哥影史上最经典的儿童片，曾在墨西哥国内创下观看人数最高纪录，几乎每个墨西哥小孩都曾看过这部影片，童年时对电影的美好回忆。这部影片在81年又拍了续集，同样获得了成功。The story of young love and the hope of friendship. This movie is such a sweet heart. I saw it when I was a kid, and all I remembered of it was that it was the coolest movie at the drive-in! I saw it on sale and decided to buy it and show it to my kids. Unfortunately it doesn't come with English subtitles, so I had to continuously pause it and translate it for them. Well needless to say it was such a cute story and had some funny moments and some really sad moments, my kids, along with myself really enjoyed it. It's definitely a Mexican classic and a great movie to watch with the ol' folks, too. I only wish the DVD came with English subtitles. P.S. it's a great way to motivate our younger generation to be fluent in their mother language (Spanish).",
