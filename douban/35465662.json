    "introduction": "Maheshwar Patar is the sole primary school teacher in Ulukunchi of West Karbi Anglong. He built Sikaisal, a place of knowledge, with his bare hands. Education is not prioritised in the Tiwa community, but his determination to break free local’s superstitions in educating them is path breaking. His hope is retiring happily after his school is provincialized so the kids in the village will continue to receive their education. He soon learns that no teacher will replace him and the school he built might end up filled with leaves rather than students.",
