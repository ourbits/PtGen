    "introduction": "Anna Margot is a rich young heiress who receives disturbing night phone calls from an old friend, Evi Linardou, once married to Anna’s brother, Alexandros. She also believes that Evi steals her money from within the hotel room where Anna lives after leaving her parents’ house. So she asks her lawyer to find the woman who threatens her before she carries out her malicious plans against Anna and her family.This is an obscure very well made 60’s thriller noir, which has never been available on VHS or DVD. It has scarcely been screened on TV so it’s a good thing someone recorded it on VHS.Director Errikos Andreou (who in the 70’s did “The Hook”, “Soul and Flesh” and “Lesbian August”) shot “Nightmare” just one year after “Psycho” was released so it’s obvious where he got his inspiration or how much he liked the Hitchcock film. “Split personality” disorder, an old creepy house with a long staircase and a domineering mother are some of the references.",
