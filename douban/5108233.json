    "introduction": "Orna Ben-Dor Niv’s documentary follows singer-songwriters, Yehuda Policker and Ya’ackov Gilad’s creative journey that resulted in Ashes and Dust – the duo’s critically acclaimed album. Through conversations with the musicians and their parents, Ben-Dor Niv paints a raw, intimate portrait of the loaded intergenerational relationship between second generation Holocaust survivors and their parents – children who have had to grow up in the shadow of their parents’ trauma and who, as adults, still carry with them the full weight of it. Viewers are taken on an emotional rollercoaster ride between the most horrific testimonials and the album’s hauntingly beautiful songs – all of which have since become staples of Israeli culture. The film has won awards both at the Berlin International Film Festival and at the Leningrad [now St. Petersburg – EE] International Festival of Documentary Films.",
