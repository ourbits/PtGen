    "introduction": "Actually this film is not entirely original, it is a parody based on the great French short film \"Le Ballon Rouge\" (The Red Balloon - 1956). Saw this tonight as part of a short film program at a The Chauvel Cinema in Sydney. Dream Doll was Oscar nominated in the Animation category. If anyone ever reads these reviews, I would strongly recommend you source both the films to make your own comparison. My preference is still far and away with the Le Ballon Rouge - this won the Grand Prize at Cannes and the Academy Award for Best Short Film in 1957. A good film to accompany Dream Doll is another Bob Godfrey Oscar nominated animated short film: Kama Sutra Rides Again. This was also on the program tonight.",
