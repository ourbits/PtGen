    "introduction": "In August 1994, Oasis blazed onto the music scene with their debut album Definitely Maybe going straight to #1. They would go on to break the charts and send the tabloids in to a spin with their rock ‘n ’roll lifestyle, infighting and success.The era of Britpop was born and propelled the band to eight UK #1 albums and singles respectively, before finally the notorious Gallagher rift fractured the band for good, 15 years after their emergence.Featuring footage and interviews from throughout their career, Oasis In Their Own Words charts the band’s meteoric rise from Manchester lads to the biggest band of their generation.",
