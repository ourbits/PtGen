    "introduction": "https://anidb.net/anime/4805At the end of the 21st century, Earth had to confront the problem of population explosion combined with resource shortages. Development of the Moon was seen as the way to solve these grave issues. The Moon's mineral resources reinvigorated the Earth and brought prosperity. However, the achievement of that vision proved painful for those who had left their home world to settle on the Moon.One of man's greatest dreams has become a nightmare for those who have been forced to live it out. Shun Nonomura does not realize it, but he is about to discover a weapon — one that can overthrow the oppressive Monopolice and bring freedom to the lunar colonists. The growing resistance movement is quick to adopt it and its creator into their ranks, as they rally around the mysterious alien monument known as Dallos...Source: ANNNote: The four episodes of Dallos were spliced together to create a two hour movie, they were then cut down to 83 minutes to create this special. In addition to footage from the original OVA series, 50 extra shots were added.",
