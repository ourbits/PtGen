    "introduction": "In this new PBS special, Peter, Paul And Mary recall, along with Mentors Pete Seeger and Ronnie Gilbert, the beginnings of the cultural revolution of the 1960s, when music became a unifying force amidst the hopeful, idealistic, and sometimes turbulent movements of social change.Carry It On: A Musical Legacy features rare archival performances of songs which energized the spirit of the nation's cultural and political renaissance. They include \"Blowin' In The Wind\" from the 1963 march on Washington, and \"The Times They Are A Changin'\" recorded at the Newport Folk Festival. These and other historic moments are woven together with songs and clips from the trio's four highly acclaimed PBS specials, as well as intimate rehearsal renditions of songs from their 2004 album In These Times.",
