    "introduction": "Best-friends Paresh and Ghanshyam, aka Bony and Fundoo are part-time engineering students and smalltime conmen. That is before they get the chance of a lifetime to rob the bank on their college campus. Armed with the masterplan of 'Baba' - an always-been-there, know-it-all soul in their college, Bony and Fundoo are all set to get their hands dirty and rich before their paper perfect plan falls apart. In deep soup, Bony and Fundoo discover that the loot had something way more precious than all the money - Kohinoor, not the diamond, but a closely guarded secret that the country's most powerful cannot afford to be let out. Two smalltime thugs and their darling, a sand mafia, a minister, a ruthless assassin, an unusual no-bullshit lady cop grappling with a not-so-unusual problem, and Bony-Fundoo amongst others, get inextricably involved in the madness surrounding Kohinoor. The reveal of it is bound to be much bigger than any of them could imagine.",
