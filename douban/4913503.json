    "introduction": "Arūnas, an 18 year old high-school graduate from the port town, is going through a crisis. He is stressed by the school routine and his friend Benas who had been earlier expelled from the school for trivial reasons, suggests he find a job. At home, his father bores Arūnas with his constant recollections about fighting in an antifascist guerrilla squad, while his mother unexpectedly turns back to her old dream of becoming an artist and decides to leave the house, taking her younger son Saulius with her. Arūnas is even more shocked by the fact that his rejuvenated mother now lives with another man, whom little Saulius already calls ‘uncle Povilas’. His father ends up in hospital, because of a grenade fragment lodged in his spine since the war. Arūnas is surrounded by the betrayal of friends. Finally, he finds himself afraid to help Benas in his bold attempt to protect a girl from drunken men. Maybe all these little dramas that grow to enormous magnitude in Arūnas’ mind will look different when a blond girl Rasa puts her hand on his shoulder while he sits sobbing on the beach.",
