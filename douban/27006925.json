The three friends agree to do a favor in an attempt to impress a pretty local girl at the beach, and shortly thereafter find themselves stuck in an increasingly dangerous situation that pulls them farther and farther away from the careless coastal vacation that they had once dreamed of having. Shades is filmed entirely from the perspective of a pair of sunglasses (think Google Glasses) with an integrated video camera.",
