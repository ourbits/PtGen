    "introduction": "Director Adrian Maben helms this retrospective on the Belgian surrealist who made the ordinary seem strange. Monsieur René Magritte, found that his emphasis was on subject rather than technique. A grand collector of unusually contrasting subject matter, this program takes you to places that fired Magritte's wild imagination. Using footage of Rene Magritte's home, left untouched after his death, as well as archival footage of the artist himself discussing his life and art, MAGRITTE is an illuminating portrait of one of the 20th century's most beloved and original artists.",
