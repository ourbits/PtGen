    "introduction": "The teenage sons of an expatriated Chinese physicist visit her in the United States, while she and her colleagues pursue the development of a massive particle collider intended to understand the origin of the universe. The Unity of All Things engages the utopian impulses of the sci-fi genre, not through the imagination of another world, but through the rendering of this world as “other”; conceiving the capitalist present allegorically as a particle collider, where instead of subatomic matter, History and subjectivity are collided and fragmented. All subjects are treated as alien, or as radical others who search for and advance different ideological, psychological or sexual ideals of belonging. Subjects oscillate between the contemplation of past societal traumas and idealizations of the future that refuse to synthesize or resolve, but instead reveal a troubling satire of the present.",
