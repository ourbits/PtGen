    "introduction": "Cohen wrote and directed this film based on his bookMohammad, My Mother And Me. The film tells the true story of a woman, played by acclaimed actress Fanny Ardant, living alone since the death of her husband who takes in an Afghan refugee against the advice of her friends and family. Ardant is one of France’s most iconic actresses and this timely refugee drama combined with Cohen’s appeal (Les Violette, Qui M’aime Me Suive) should put this on a festival must-have list. Now in post, the film should be ready in time for a run in the spring or autumn festival season.",
