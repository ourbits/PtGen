    "introduction": "A comedy about abortive loves and about a friendship which survives them. Shabtai, a junk peddler and Herzel, his aide, drive through the streets of Tel Aviv buying and selling used furniture and trash. Now and again, Shabtai takes a nap and in his dreams, a passionate red-haired woman makes love to him. One day, Shabtai discovers her photograph in a face-cream advertisement. The woman of his dreams really exists. He sets out to find her, but it is Herzel who first wins her attention and then her heart. Herzel, however, loves Batya… An urban fairy tale, an inverted Cinderella story. Instead of a poor young girl – two elderly machos on a decrepit motorcycle; instead of a shoe found at midnight – a shabby ping-pong table abandoned in a parking lot.",
