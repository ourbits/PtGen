    "introduction": "In 1999 the Cinemateca Portuguesa commissioned the pianist and composer Bernardo Sassetti to score Maria do Mar, by Leitão de Barros, the first film to be restored in the then recently opened Arquivo Nacional das Imagens em Movimento (National Archive of Moving Images). Manuel Mozos recovers the memory of this creative process through the archives of the composer's music sessions. The testimonies of those who closely followed their recording and also the restoration of the film make up a composition that allows us to rediscover the landscapes and people of Nazaré, almost 100 years later.",
