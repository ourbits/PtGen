    "introduction": "Between 2020 and 2021 all media and public opinion were focused on the international health crisis. In Fernetti, at an internal EU border between Italy and Slovenia a few kilometres from Trieste, migrants who managed to cross the border were stopped by Italian law enforcement and sent back, without being identified and without the option of applying for international protection. The Ministry of the Interior refers to these operations as ‘informal readmissions’, defending their legitimacy but neglecting to recount how they really happen…Together with images captured on mobile phones by the migrants themselves during their long journey, their stories of rejection and readmission are intertwined with the ongoing contradictions and debate happening within institutions.",
