    "introduction": "Karl Lemieux works across artistic mediums, incorporating film, music, and sound art into his practice. Shot on 16 mm film, this piece creatively portrays the making of Creation Destruction, a multidisciplinary outdoor performance by choreographer Dana Gingras. With a keen eye for detail, Lemieux captures these rehearsals and provides a glimpse into the neighbourhood hosting the event. The inspired fluidity of the editing makes the finished work feel both vaporous and concrete. The richly produced sound design foregrounds the music of members of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, while elements of the surrounding sonic environment leak in at the edges; the resulting fusion anchors the film in a suspended present.
