    "introduction": "Yoko Yuki is one of the graduates of the Tokyo University of the Arts who aggressively break with a classical Japanese animation tradition and habitually ruffle some feathers. She describes her film as an experimental montage of diary-like sketches. The result is a rollicking, exuberant collection of animation sequences reminiscent of children’s drawings with a chaotic soundtrack and babble of voices. Anti-art as the recipe for success.",
