    "introduction": "Michal has been bed-ridden for over three years. She suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The uncurable disease prevents her from normal functioning. Between hospital stays, Michal is also a wife and mother of two children. While her adolescent daughter is helping her father to take care of the house, Michal is accompanied by her 7-year old son. The boy does not understand much, but in his presence Michal revives as finally she may fulfil herself in the role of a mother, rather than just be a patient.源自：https://www.krakowfilmfestival.pl/en/online-cinema/film/4176/",
