    "introduction": "Summer 2022, eastern Ukraine. Not far from the frontline, where the full-scale Russian invasion on Ukraine has been taking place, Russian troops are advancing. Solomya, a twenty-year-old graphic designer, is impatiently waiting for her boyfriend Sashko (25) to return from the front-line and spend a few days with her. She is overjoyed when she finally sees him. They both cannot wait to passionately make love together and afterwards to play around with Sashko’s new night vision device. Using the device, Solomya looks at a reproduction of the famous Black Square painting hanging in her room. She notices that the Black Square is shining through the darkness, becoming a radiant black hole, a gloomy premonition! The past, present and future all merge into one another.",
