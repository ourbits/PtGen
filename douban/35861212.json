    "introduction": "Death of an Undertaker follows the story of Sparrow, a twentysomething who is tasked with exhuming a 20 year old corpse as part of his work in a Sydney funeral home. Filmed over 7 years and initially conceived as a documentary, the film is a blend of fact and fiction, interweaving documentary footage from years past with fictional material filmed entirely in the early weeks of Sydney's 2020 lockdown. Stemming from director/actor Christian Byers' actual experiences as a part time worker in the funeral home amongst his cast of non-professional actors, the film is a poetic, darkly funny and deeply personal portrait of a psyche in turmoil, confronting themes of mortality, grief and acceptance.",
