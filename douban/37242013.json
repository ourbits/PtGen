    "introduction": "Long-hailed as one of the UK's most original and notorious writers, Irvine Welsh has a reputation for many things – not least of which includes being responsible for the iconic book and film 'Trainspotting'. Across novels, screenplays and his outspoken presence on social media, Welsh has both celebrated and defined British society and culture, whilst simultaneously exposing all its flaws. In this feature documentary, we spend a year in his company, revealing both his creative process and the radical sense of mischief that has successfully sustained a career spanning four decades.",
