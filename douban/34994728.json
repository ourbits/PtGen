For Nestor (Ariel Perez de María) and Rafa (Tomas Fonzi) this is the most important match of their lives. both fans are determined to travel all the way from Buenos Aires to Mendoza, more than 700 miles, with ease and time ahead to live that unique moment. Nestor's superstitions, their encounters with the Barras Bravas (Hooligans), one of the players being injured, and the sudden appearance of Fabian (Fernando Govergun) give them supreme power to win the match. And they'll do anything to win THE GAME.",
