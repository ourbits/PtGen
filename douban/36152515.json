    "introduction": "Young film director Tamás is invited to a village to lead a summer art workshop for kids. He quickly discovers that the village is overrun with corruption and exploitation. He starts an investigation into the abusive mayor and exposes him by shooting a documentary, but his good intentions threaten everyone involved. The mayor finds out about Tamás' new mission, the locals turn against each other, and what began as an easy-going summer adventure results in disaster. Martin Boross’ feature debut is a critical reflection on the filmmakers’ responsibility and harmful activism in an all-too-familiar microcosm of oppression.",
