    "introduction": "<Content> is an ambient 21st century road movie from Chris PETIT whose <Radio On> (1979) has become a cult road classic, about drift and driving’s trancelike state rather than destination and the unfolding of the road. It is about life in the rearview mirror, memory, modern technology (the You Tube generation, email seduction) and the new landscape of the big shed, and driving into the flatlands of late middle age, fathers and sons, growing up in the cold war, genocide and assassination, and the postwar landscapes of Europe and the USA, and how life looks now, seen by a six-year-old from the back of a car.",
