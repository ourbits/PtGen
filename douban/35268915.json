Soderbergh is an Oscar-winning filmmaker best known for directing the “Ocean’s Eleven\" trilogy, “Erin Brockovich” and “Traffic.” He and Holland previously collaborated on the Showtimes series “The Knick.”“And I think all along you know, very early on…before we even like released High Flying Bird, we, we sort of knew we wanted...there was more to do, more to say. And we just wanted to plant the seed with High Flying Bird, but this next thing will actually be more all-encompassing. And even better, I hope.”",
