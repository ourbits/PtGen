    "introduction": "“A statue in white marble presents a scene from Greek mythology in which the boy Hylas, the companion of Hercules, goes to collect water from a stream, as is lured into the depths by water nymphs who are entranced by his beauty.” Thus described John Gibson in 1837 his statue Hylas surprised by the Naiade that Rinland films in Tate Britain, as it’s being explored – and narrated – by the inquisitive hands of a blind man. The camera’s tight focus on the hands, and the knowledge that can be gained through touch are prescient of later works by Rinland that foreground the tactile.",
