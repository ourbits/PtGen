    "introduction": "Fascinating and intriguing. Potestad is a puzzle that is at the same time sublime and cruel: sublime because of its elaborated script, cruel because of its content. Bit by bit, each of the movie's numerous flashbacks completes the puzzle. After a screening in Bruges (Belgium), director D'Angiolillo explained he wanted the audience to gradually identify itself with the movie's protagonist. Partly thanks to the brilliant performance of medical doctor-actor Pavlovsky (who used to perform the text of Potestad on stage) D'Angiolillo reaches his target remarkably well. By focusing on the past and present of an individual and his relationship with his fellow human beings the movie explores Argentine's notorious dictatorship during the seventies. `Potestad' therefore recalls `La Historia Oficial' and `Garage Olimpo'. The main question coming to mind after having seen such a powerful piece of work is: Why do movies like this barely make it to the theatres whereas the whole world has no option but to watch the usual Hollywood rubbish?",
