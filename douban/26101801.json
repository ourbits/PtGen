    "introduction": "In the last few years, the horror genre has grown to be an unavoidable phenomenon, whether in America, Asia or in Europe. Zombies, viruses, apocalypse, bogeymen have all become familiar elements of popular culture. What do horror films of the 21st century have to say about our world, about politics and about us?Why is there such a resurgence of horror today?This will be the starting point of this documentary, conceived as a personal journey for a narrator who is a die hard fan as well as a critic of its excess, a journey to the fringes of cinema, alongside young directors, who are as talented as they are polemical (Alexandre Aja, Eli Roth, Neil Marshall, Balaguero and Plaza…).",
