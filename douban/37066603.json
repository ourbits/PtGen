    "introduction": "After losing her husband, Sultan, who is afraid of being left alone, tells her children that she wants to remarry immediately. However, her children do not find this appropriate, as only one day has passed since their father's death. Her son Nevzat, who has a traditional perspective, believes that no one in the small town will approve of this. Although her daughter Reyhan tries to respect her mother's wish, she thinks it is a decision made too soon. Despite her children's objections, Sultan does not give up on her desire. While searching for a suitable spouse, she also enters into business ventures, doing everything that people said \"a woman cannot do.\" She converts her home into a guesthouse and manages it, opens a stall in the market, and competes with male vendors. Sultan’s attitude sets an example for other women in the town, who also begin to lead independent lives and work in the guesthouse and market like Sultan. Sultan’s struggle will also lead to the organization of women in the town and the development of their own identities.",
