    "introduction": "In Le Fléau (working title), Eléonore Saintagnan is once again the heroine of her own tale. Short on inspiration, she drives west. Her car breaks down in the depths of Central Brittany, miles away from anything, especially the sea. She sees it as a sign and rents a campsite cabin overlooking a lake. The landscape brings back memories from her childhood. As a little girl, she spent her holidays in a similar place. Wandering through this isolated region, crossing paths with its inhabitants, from one mobile home to the next, she observes the present, summons up the past and allows herself to be overwhelmed by fiction.",
