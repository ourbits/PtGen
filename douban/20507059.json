    "introduction": "Gabby Logan and Greg James present a fun, irreverent and uplifting countdown of the 50 greatest moments from the unforgettable London Olympics of 2012, featuring contributions from the likes of Usain Bolt, Jessica Ennis, Jimmy Carr, Reggie Yates, Andy Murray, Tom Daley, Mo Farah, Gary Lineker, Greg James, Cherry Healey and Mel C.We relive all the great sporting moments, such as 'Super Saturday', when Team GB won three gold medals in 45 glorious minutes, and also look back at some of the lighter moments of the games, including Her Majesty the Queen's show-stopping role in the opening ceremony and German diver Stephan Feck's painful backflop in the Aquatic Centre.It was the summer when everybody was doing the Mobot or growing their sideburns Wiggo-style. We all remember where we were when Andy Murray won gold at Wimbledon or when proud dad Bert le Clos became a star live on BBC Television.",
