Players will use a variety of crime scene investigation techniques to meticulously uncover evidence in a series of puzzling murders and to ultimately reveal who among them is the killer. Some players will form alliances in the competition, while others will choose to go it alone in their quest for the grand prize of $250,000. The contestants will be guests on a glamorous estate called Rue Manor with a steward, Butler Giles (Gildart Jackson), and each week must solve a new crime in order to advance in the game. Failure to solve the crime will lead to a player's demise, until only three are left. In the final episode, one player will unmask the killer and take home the $250,000 prize.Anthony E. Zuiker, creator of the CSI franchise, brings the world of murder and intrigue to his first primetime reality series, Whodunnit?, airing in nine episodes this summer on the ABC Television Network. Cris Abrego partners with Zuiker for the new series.",
