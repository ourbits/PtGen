    "introduction": "Jasper's in a Jam is one of the most entertaining shorts from George Pal Puppetoons to feature a little black boy. Instead of the usual shanty that the Jasper shorts usually take place in, this one's setting is at a big-city apartment that has a pawn shop with various musical instruments. When Jasper finds himself trapped in this pawnshop, many of these instruments come to life. With music by Charlie Barnet and vocals by Peggy Lee, Jasper's in a Jam has some of the most coolest collage of melody and visuals from a doll-animated film. So it is with great enthusiasm that I recommend this short to any fan of Big Band music and to many George Pal completists, bar none!",
