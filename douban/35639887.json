    "introduction": "Many Thais suffering from poverty choose the lottery over labor or frugality to get out of poverty. For them, religion is the only way to bring that luck and happiness. With a delicate sense, the film portrays humans surrounding Buddhist rituals from an anthropological perspective. Its dense images and sounds contain insight into how religious rituals make people forget not only their own hardships but also the political convulsions of Thai society.",
