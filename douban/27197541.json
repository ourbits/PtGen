    "introduction": "\"Our memory is so unreliable - sometimes what we see might as well be the future.\" -Johanna F.   What we see is the everyday life of a Viennese family in the 1950's, documented by 13-year-old Johanna, a childhood captured on 8mm film (or: a childhood as it might have been). Fragments of family history and family secrets; an apartment regularly visited by women, more than men, centered around grandmother Maria who holds weekly cooking clubs in her kitchen. But somehow, the women never actually seem to do any cooking - - - \"Papa always said you have to be quick if you want to see anything. Because everything vanishes so quickly. But I don't think that's true. I think you just have to keep looking\". And Johanna keeps looking. Until the camera's gaze suddenly turns on herself. (IMDb)",
