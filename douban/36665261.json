    "introduction": "Dotcom was the man behind MegaUpload, an early online sharing site that the U.S. government declared to be a criminal enterprise. Relentlessly pursued by the FBI and CIA, his extravagant lifestyle, legal battles and defiance of copyright enforcement divided opinion: Some saw him as a symbol of digital resistance and others a major criminal. The series will be a “mix of investigative thriller, courtroom drama and a gripping exploration of the darker corners of the internet” and explores the “profound consequences of challenging government authority.”",
