    "introduction": "Then Churchill Said To Me is a six episode, 1982, comedy television series starring Frankie Howerd and Nicholas Courtney.The show is set in the 1940s in Winston Churchill's secret underground bunker. Howerd plays a soldier named Private Potts who according to the DVD's cover \"acts as a batman to a group of officers\" who, like the character of Lurcio in the popular Up Pompeii! is hell-bent on avoiding work and gets into various scrapes as a result of this.The premise of the show was similar in content to the previous Howerd vehicles Up Pompeii! and Whoops Baghdad but in a more contemporary setting. In one episode Private Potts is revealed to be a doppelganger of a high-ranking general, also portrayed by Howerd, echoing storylines from these series and their big screen adaptations.",
