    "introduction": "James McCullough, from the mysterious \"Council\", assigns CIA agent Aaron Delgado to implement a plan to attack the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and pin the blame on Muslim Terrorists. Delgado and fellow agents, Phillip Singer and Chase Jordan, work with a group of unsuspecting engineers to develop unmanned jets to hit the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. The CIA agents have to deal with an increasingly suspicious George Poole, the lead engineer working on the drones. Also the Army and the FBI begin to uncover the plot, forcing Delgado to shut down their investigations. On the day of the attacks, Delgado becomes livid as the media reports on the destruction of WTC Building 7 before it is blown up and that there are no signs of planes hitting the Pentagon and the supposed crash site of Flight 93.
