    "introduction": "On Addison’s birthday, her best friend Minnie throws her a party. At the party, she kisses a good looking man - Damien - to invoke jealousy in her ex-boyfriend, Caleb. But the kiss throws her and her friends into a supernatural realm... and Damien turns out to be the human incarnate of Death. This spooky alternate reality - in-between the mortal and underworld - is Death’s realm, and he wants to punish Addison through a series of deadly games for how she betrayed him in their previous lives. With no memory of her past life, Addison begs Death to let her go. Death challenges Addison to prove him wrong – win the games by passing his test of her character. Winning each game saves a loved one, and a part of Addison’s soul. But unbeknown to Addison, the games are rigged in favour of Death. The games force Addison to confront her flaws, her relationships, and grow into her sense of self – all while she is trying not to fall in love with Death…在艾迪生的生日那天，她最好的朋友米妮为她举办了一个派对。在派对上，她亲吻了一个长相英俊的男人达米恩，以引起前男友凯勒布的嫉妒。但这个吻把她和她的朋友们带入了一个超自然的领域......达米恩原来是死亡的化身。这个介于凡人和冥界之间的诡异的另类现实是死神的领域，他想通过一系列致命的游戏来惩罚艾迪生，因为她在他们的前世背叛了他。由于对她过去的生活没有任何记忆，艾迪生恳求死神放过她。死亡挑战艾迪生去证明他错了——通过他对艾迪生性格的测试来赢得比赛。赢得每一场比赛都会拯救一个所爱的人，也会拯救艾迪生灵魂的一部分。但在艾迪生不知情的情况下，游戏被操纵，有利于死亡。游戏迫使艾迪生直面自己的缺点、人际关系，并培养自我意识——而她一直在努力不爱上死神......",
