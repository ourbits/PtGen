    "introduction": "Hot Wins (made in the majority language, Hindi) boldly confronts a problem familiar to every Indian but hitherto 'taboo' in Indian cinema, theatre and literature: the tension between the Hindu majority and the Muslim minority in India, one of the most delicate and sensitive issues in Indian politics. Indian art had conventionally avoided the issue by showing HIndus and Mislims in their own repective communities, with hardly any penetration of each other's worlds. The truth is, of course, less tidy, and Sathyu tries to broach it by looking back to 1947, the year that india was granted independence, when the sub-continent was divided into India and Pakistan. The partition is not only the background and context for the film's plot, but also its main dynamic, since the storyline chronicles the break-up of a large Muslim family in North India as more and more of its members leave for a brighter future in Pakistan.",
