    "introduction": "Pregnant housewife Edie Canody loves her husband Benjamin, but when her father-in-law passes away, they must return to his hometown of Loves Park for the funeral. Leaving home becomes difficult, however, when her husband is expected to take over the family business left in his name. Edie soon becomes weary and nauseous as her and her husband are falling under the thumb of his mother's wishes to stay in Loves Park. As his new responsibilities begin to take over, Edie befriends a young local neighbor named Dustin, and boredom, anxiety, and intense wanderlust ensue. Soon their friendship begins to undermine her status as 'happy mother and wife,' and Edie fails to let it go before it's too late.",
