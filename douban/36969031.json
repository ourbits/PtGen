    "introduction": "After arriving at a Cape Town police station to report a crime, Mzu finds an elderly man has been waiting at the back of the line longer than those ahead of him. The station is busy and chaotic, and the old man is confused with no one to help him. Mzu takes it upon himself to ensure that the old man is helped. He quickly finds resistance from those ahead in the line and the stifling bureaucratic system. This is an allegory of South Africa’s complex society, where a sense of powerlessness and hope exist simultaneously, often in equal measures.",
