    "introduction": "The stage comedian Carlo Verdone directed and stars as the three main characters -- Furio, Mimmo, and Pasquale -- in this classic Italian comedy. All three men are driving back to their hometowns to vote on election day, and each has a different story and a different though easily recognizable personality type. The movie follows by a year Un Sacco bello (1980). Both the movies are just a kind of \"collage\" of all Verdone characters played during his TV shows in the '70s. Nevertheless clearly we are in front of his first steps as film director, Carlo demonstrated already his big talent to underline trough his comedies the Italians and their defects. For anyone interested in Verdone cinema this is a must. For everyone happy to see a fine comedy about Italians this is a must. To have funny time in the Verdone's way this is a must. Twenty-four year later this \"Bianco, rosso e Verdone\" is still actual and unequaled. A must see.",
