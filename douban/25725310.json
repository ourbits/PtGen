    "introduction": "A conspirator? A man with ideas of his own intent on making them come true? An arm-wrestler? The greatest avoider of Franco's censorship? Someone insistent on changing the world by putting a mirror in front of it? A schemer? The most important name in the history of Spanish cinema? For some, Elías Querejeta is the prototype of what a producer should be, responsible for the fact that there are excellent films, responsible for the discovery of many of the most important spanish film directors. For others, he is the instigator of some of the most passionate controversies of our cinema.",
