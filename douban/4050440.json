    "introduction": "Set in the Yugoslav province of Herzegovina this crime drama follows a gang of thugs as they terrorize the locals, the tourists, and young women. The delinquent boys pay special attention to the newest girl in town who sells newspapers, and wager over which one of them will have her first. One boy is genuinely interested in her. When she spurns him, the other boys brutally gang rape her while her rejected suitor helplessly watches.Yugoslavian director, screenwriter, and playwright Boro Draskovic first made his name directing theatrical productions and operas. Graduating from Belgrade's Academy of Theater, Film, Radio, and Television in 1959, Draskovic entered the film industry as an assistant to Polish director Andrzej Wajda in 1962. Four years later, he assisted Jerzy Kawalerowicz. Draskovic sold his first screenplay in 1964. In 1969, he made his first fictional feature film, Horoskop/Horoscope, and subsequently made three more features, all of which he co-scripted. In addition, Draskovic has made documentaries and worked on television and radio; he has also written several books on cinema and theater.",
