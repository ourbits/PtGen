    "introduction": "Many movie critics, believe this is Emilio \"El Indio\" Fernandez best film. Up till then all his movies photographed by Gabriel Figueroa, just like this one, had had a very generous budget, where the aesthetics were a very important part of his movies. In this one, due to the crisis in the Cinematographic Mexican Industry, there were not enough means for this. Fernandez had to use the dialogs in a wiser manner. This movie is the story of a former prisoner that comes back to his hometown to look for his longlife love who is now living in the outskirts of town bearing a baby, product from a violation by the Town's leading \"citizen\". In a way, we could say that this movie was inspired in the John Ford's Westerns, which Fernandez admired. The leading actress, Columba Dominguez was given this movie, mainly because she was Fernandez' mistress and it was a good choice, this is considered the 13th movie in importance in Mexico's history. In 1977 Fernandez made a very poor second version of his movie now called Mexico Norte which was not anywhere near the first version.",
