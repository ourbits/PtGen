    "introduction": "Twenty year-old Gwen's recent conversion to Christianity causes a conflict between her and her \"party girl\" best friend. There's tension at home as well. Gwen's mom is fighting a serious addiction to pain killers, and her dad, a tough corporate lawyer, has just taken the civil suit case against the owner's of her new church. Gwen's nurturing kindness helps heal all those around who \"thirst\" for unconditional love and acceptance.在这部令人振奋和鼓舞人心的影片中，一位改变信仰成为基督徒年轻的妇女改变了他周围的人们——包括她那酷爱聚会的好友，沉溺于药丸的母亲和一心只想着工作的父亲——以一种意想不到的方法。",
