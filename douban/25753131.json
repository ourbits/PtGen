When he's given the chance to enter in to a school competition to win some prize money for Maggie, his 11yr. old sister, he takes the opportunity. Faced with a lack of food, and a grim living situation, the two siblings come up with a shot list that ensures their victory. When their unsupportive, and drug-abusive father, Ron, comes in to the picture, Russell now finds himself faced with confronting his broken relationship with his father, and trying to finish the competition for his sister in finding the perfect picture.",
