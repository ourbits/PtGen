    "introduction": "The Film maps the terrorist acts of individuals in the period of \"normalisation\" in Czechoslovakia. Their attempts, which often remained unrealized, were isolated heroic cries in the homogeneous gray mass of society. With the main theme as the background, the film looks at issues of ethics, irrationality and terrorism, its sense and deadly force in today's world. The film focuses on a trio of protagonists. The first wanted to blow up a podium during Labour Day celebrations in the 1970's. The second wanted to assassinate the President and launch an anti-Communist revolution, but his letter addressed to the CIA was so naive that he never received a response. The third destroyed billboards. At the time their acts were crimes, though today they are considered to be heroism. It is a film about relative perspectives on history and its heroes.",
