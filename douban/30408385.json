    "introduction": "Renowned for his ground-breaking work, Anthony Neilson (The Prudes, Unreachable, The Wonderful World of Dissocia) makes his National Theatre debut with this contemporary reimagining of Edgar Allan Poe’s classic tale of a haunted conscience.A young playwright rents an attic flat in Brighton, hoping it will break the writer’s block that’s preventing her from following up on her wildly successful debut. Whilst there, she forms a relationship with her landlady, a lonely young woman with a life-altering condition.But pressure mounts on the writer, and her relationship with the landlady becomes ever-more suffocating.",
