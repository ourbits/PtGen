Everything is turned upside down when the harsh and bad-tempered editor of his comic strips, rejects the work of Boule’s father. She perceives a great lack of inspiration in it, due to the fact that his family lives in a world of happiness that has a very negative impact on his creativity. Boule’s father comes back home with the firm intention of shaking his family off happiness by doing a lot of silly things.Boule, Bill and their mother as well begin to partake in the disruption of the family’s happiness, until finally everything explodes.",
