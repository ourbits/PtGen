    "introduction": "Directed by Julien Temple, this 1979 documentary about punk rock was filmed as a spoof of old wartime films. Capturing the unique essence of punk rock culture, Temple effectively seizes the overwhelming sense of anger that was felt in the U.K. during the time of filming. The end of the '70s proved to be a launching pad for the genre, as throngs of punks were brought together by thoughts of vengeance and an enduring promise never to acquiesce",
