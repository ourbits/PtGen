    "introduction": "It is told that this movie was one of Anthony Perkins favorites.You may say that the story is misogyny, an ode to macho way of life, but is still compelling how this men try to cross the desert in order of put the railroad that will lead to the progress. There are enough characters for many pictures and everyone with his own story, but one is a hero and an antagonist: The Mayor, played by David Reynoso in the role that marked his career. A tough man for a tough mission. And the counterpart appears when his son comes to scene.In my point of view, this part not only complicates the plot but humanizes it. That when we can understand the manhood, the relation between a father made of stone and the son wanting not still his love, but his respect. They have to collide and unite in a dangerous time and place: The desert, a tiger, and his claws, the black wind.",
