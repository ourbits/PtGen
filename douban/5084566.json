    "introduction": "Always question just what it’s like to be adult celebrity? Annually numerous teenagers travel to Hollywood along with hopes of popularity, however some can get their names in fluorescent lights. Only on the opposite side of the hill, a specific Hollywood provides a faster and relatively easier chance for immortality. For several shows creators expose us to the \"Europe silent film\" and its occupants, a lot of whom are old neighbors, but joined in one historical series.Review: Quite a long time looking for something similar. But what he saw not that disappointed, but tough feeling that we could do better, perhaps, the strongest.According to the present, will receive the first and sixth series. They had quite a sound approach when they took a certain time interval and show how to develop film in different countries. How to reflect the same event. It was a lot of analysts and all perky and fun. Medium series were based on a completely different structure. We took a country, say Germany or Sweden there and showed how things were there for a dozen years. In the end, everything was very fragmented and isolated. That is, on the one hand flashed phrases that worked here the Germans and the British, but all in all it turned out, as if each was cooked in its own juices.Still did not like, again in the middle series some selectivity, that is, for example, in the first set and remembered Danes and Italians. Something like flickering and the sixth series, to Delhi, say, Poles, Russia, Spain, in the end, I am silent about Greeks there or I do not know, the Portuguese.The series is well suited for those who do not well informed and not in the subject. The rest can quickly become bored retellings of various films of the period. Causing suffering analytical component. Instead of retelling the story could talk about something else.",
