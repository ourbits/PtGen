    "introduction": "The abandoned castles of Europe are magnificent markers of the continent's tempestuous history, but where they once hosted royalty, these empty, hulking structures are now overtaken by the wildlife and rich natural environments flourishing around them. From the exquisite brown bears and aquatic salamanders of Predjama Castle, to the Neuschwanstein Castle that inspired the fictional fortresses of some of Disney's most iconic princesses, explore the curious history of these imposing European structures and the creatures that now call them home.",
