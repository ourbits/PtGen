    "introduction": "A fresh coming-of-age film that depicts the diversity of way of living through scrap-and-build.A member of the high school art club called Sakuko falls into the sea while sketching a boat. Witnessing the incident, Saibara creates a painting titled \"Drowning Sakuko\" and wins an award at a contest, leading the painting to be displayed at school. Moreover, Saibara takes the liberty of announcing that she will paint Sakuko for her next piece during a newspaper interview. Frustrated by the situation, Sakuko gives up on her artistic path and attempts to create a new work with the motif of a \"boat\" in her home, which is scheduled for demolition. The self-made cinema Motomachi Movie Theater takes notice of expressing the diversity of life choices through \"scrap-and-build\". They recommend the film, stating that the characters in the midst of their youth confront their identities and attempt to reconcile with others, seemingly in small ways but potentially taking significant steps to change society.源自：https://jff.jpf.go.jp/watch/ic2023/films/a-muse-never-drowns/",
