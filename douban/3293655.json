The milkman then stops at a cafeteria, where he discusses Miss Laughton's wealth and eccentricity with the man at the counter. The conversation is overheard by Frank Bramwell, who then plans to visit Miss Laughton with his wife, so that they can rob her. When they reach her home, they are shown into an empty parlor, where she introduces them to a number of imaginary relatives, and shows them an open, empty coffin. Fearing that she is insane, Lorna Bramwell wants to leave, but Frank sees the situation as an even better opportunity than he'd hoped for - and he is not above using force to get what he wants.",
