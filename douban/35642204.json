    "introduction": "Last Visit is a tribute to Lefteris Voyatzis (1945 - 2013), an indisputable milestone in the modern history of Greek theater that defined people, projects, and our theatrical perception. He defined and was defined by the Theater of Odou Kykladon. At this place he left work, memories, and senses that still intensively exist. Through this strange dreamy visit he returns to favourable theatrical place for a proper farewell to his friends and colleagues. —Spiros Alidakis",
