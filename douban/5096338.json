    "introduction": "The series consisted of three two-hour films: \"Savage Christmas: Hong Kong 1941\", \"Death by Moonlight: Bomber Command\" and \"In Desperate Battle: Normandy 1944\". The series were broadcast to critical acclaim. Almost three million people, in English and French, viewed each prime time broadcast.[edit] Savage ChristmasThe central theme of this program was that the force of soldiers sent to fight in the Battle of Hong Kong was \"knowingly sent into a war zone without adequate training.\" [2] The episode first aired on 12 January 1992.[3] This episode was the least controversial:This program was the one least criticized by veterans and historians; indeed, except for three minutes of a 104-minute presentation, \"Savage Christmas\" showed nothing to which any reasonable person could object.[4][edit] Death by MoonlightThe central themes of the second program in the series are that Bomber Command \"deliberately hid the truth\" about RAF bomber crew survival rates, concealed plans about deliberately annihilating civilians, and betrayed the trust of Canadian military airmen.[5] The episode first aired on 19 January 1992.[6][edit] In Desperate BattleThe central theme of the third and final presentation in the series concern the training and leadership of the Canadian Army in the Battle of Normandy, alleging that \"The true story of those battles has never really been told.\"[7] The show first aired on 26 January 1992.",
