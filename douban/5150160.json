    "introduction": "Stian is 31 years old, has had problems with his love life for a long time, and has gradually lowered his demands to the degree that he will accept just about anyone who would have him. A somewhat resigned young man who has invested in a family car, and is ready to propose to his girlfriend Stine.But as usual with Stian, things do not work out as expected, and suddenly he is once again left high and dry. Unforeseen events suddenly make Stian?s life seem hopeless. Lonely and abandoned, he seeks comfort from his parents, only to find that they side with Stine. When he discovers that his best friend Anders frequently visits his childhood home even when he is not present (and with much more success), Stian has had it. He decides to seek out Robyn, whom he met at a taekwondo gathering in Umeå seventeen years earlier. Anders joins him, initially because he is such a good mate, but gradually he appears to have his own agenda.",
