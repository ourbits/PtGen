    "introduction": "In honor of educator Paulo Freire , the Ministry of Education (MEC), through the Department of Distance Education (Seed), launches the documentary \"Paulo Freire contemporaneous\", by Toni Venturi. According to the director, the video takes up the origins of the first experiences of literacy and popular education developed by Paulo Freire and shows how his thinking and pedagogy are still present today. This is not just a memory movie. The documentary shows situations in which the Freirean teaching model is used today. People are unaware of actions that drank from that fountain. The film updates Paulo Freire and shows how he took root in many segments of society.",
