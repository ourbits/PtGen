    "introduction": "This is the most powerful documentary on 9/11. We see the impact of a woman's death in the World Trade Center on her family, mainly her 7 year old son. This was the epitome of what the country felt; sadness, fear and Anger. The documentary, shown on HBO, centered around 7 year old Nicholas. His mother had not returned home the day of the tragedy and never did. Thus necessitating telling Nicholas what happened. A truly heart wrenching view of 9/11's smallest and most innocent victims. It is raw and uncensored for the most part, true Reality TV.",
