    "introduction": "At 15, he took a life. Three days later, his brother’s life was taken. A documentary visual album, “Songs from the Hole” follows James \"JJ'88\" Jacobs through a musical opus of Hip-Hop and Soul, inspired by his innermost struggles as both a perpetrator and a victim of violence as he serves a double-life prison sentence. The film interweaves the collective storytelling of its non-fiction participants with imagined representations of memories, dreams and spiritual dialogues set to its protagonist/co-creator’s original music.源自：https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/films/2197042",
