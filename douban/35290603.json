    "introduction": "A Creepshow Holiday Special stars Anna Camp (Pitch Perfect) and Adam Pally (The Mindy Project). It is written and directed by Creepshow showrunner Greg Nicotero and based on a short story by J.A. Konrath (Last Call). In the holiday themed, hour-long episode, Shapeshifters Anonymous, fearing he is a murderer, an anxious man searches for answers for his \"unique condition\" from an unusual support group.A Creepshow Holiday Special trailer teases some of the horror that fans will be able to check out next week. As is the case with most good trailers, this one leaves a lot more questions than answers, which Creepshow fans will likely find to be intriguing. We all want to know what goes down in Shapeshifters Anonymous (\"were-cheetah\" and \"were-tortoise?\"), and luckily, we don't have to wait too much longer to see what the Shudder crew has put under the Christmas tree for us this year. However, there might be more than a few people who are a little too scared to tear off the wrapping paper, thanks to the creepy trailer.",
