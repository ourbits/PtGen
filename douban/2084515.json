    "introduction": "一部极富质感的戏剧。The Fire That Burns是根据法国多产的小说家和剧作家Henry de Montherlant的小说，“The Land Whose King is a Child” （《传道书》10章第06节： “Woe to the land whose king is a child）改编而成的。这个故事发生在第二次世界大战前，巴黎的一所天主教男子学校里，生性乐观的学生André Sevrais  （ Naël Marandin ）与比他年幼的校友Souplier （Clément van den Bergh）之间的友谊引起了Pradts 神父的嫉妒（Christophe Malavoy） ，而他暗地里秘密的奴役着年轻的Souplier 。于是Pradts神父设计陷害Sevrais，但最终，他搬石头砸了自己的脚，并受到了院长(Michel Aumont）的蔑视。THE FIRE THAT BURNSA richly textured drama, The Fire That Burns is based on the novel “The Land Whose King is a Child” [referring to Ecclesiastes 10:6: “Woe to the land whose king is a child] by prolific, French novelist and dramatist Henry de Montherlant.The story takes place before World War II in a Catholic boys’ school in Paris, where the friendship between bright philosophy student André Sevrais (Naël Marandin) and his younger schoolmate Souplier (Clément van den Bergh of Class Trip) arouses the jealousy of the Abbot de Pradts (Christophe Malavoy), who is secretly in the thrall of young Souplier. De Pradts lays a trap for Sevrais but ends up crushed by his own machinations to the utter disdain of the Father Superior (Michel Aumont of The Closet and Man is a Woman).Christophe Malavoy, who has appeared in over 60 French films, directed and stars in The Fire That Burns. In 1983, Malavoy received the “Most Promising Male Actor” prize at the César Awards (France’s equivalent of our Academy Awards™).Henry de Montherlant was born into a noble Roman Catholic family in 1896 Paris. His early works were inspired by his personal experiences in parochial schools. His popularity among the French people endures to this very day, where a swimming pool in Paris is named after him. And de Montherlant must surely be smiling down from heaven because at this pool, men are not allowed to wear boxer-style swim shorts – only “Speedos™!”.",
