    "introduction": "A judge is about to sentence members of a motorcycle gang for murder when he gets blackmailed because of an affair with a teenage babysitter.Quote:An assistant DA (George Carey) is prosecuting a biker for a vicious murder. The lawyer's home-life meanwhile is a wreck: He has a nagging, frigid wife and a newborn son, and his adult daughter is a lesbian. Things go from bad to worse, however, when he is unable to resist the charms of his seductive underage babysitter (Patricia Wymer). Meanwhile, the girlfriend of the biker befriends the prosecutor's daughter, hoping to get some photos of her with her lover so she can use them to blackmail the father. She really hits the jackpot though when she stumbles upon the man himself en flagrante with his babysitter mistress. . .This movie would be a lot more believable if the hero was a handsome thirty-year-old guy rather than someone like Carey who looks more like the elderly FATHER of a thirty year old. (Even in the \"free love\" 60's his sexual affair with a teenage girl really beggars belief). Fortunately, this movie doesn't take itself too seriously. For instance, the first time the babysitter, \"Candy\", is left alone in the house she calls a couple of \"friends\" over, who turn out to be a loud rock band complete with a couple of girls who dance naked to their groovy music! This movie is surprisingly hard to find these days, even though its sequel \"Weekend with the Babysitter\" is readily available. This is the better of the two by far largely due to Patricia Wymer. Although she is obviously several years older than her character here, she is simply a much better actress than the unknown Susan Romen who played this part in the sequel. Carey, meanwhile, not only starred in both movies, but he also wrote and produced both of them as well (which makes you wonder what kind of dirty old man he was in real life). Tom McLoughlin, who went on to do \"The Born Losers\" and \"Billy Jack\", directed both movies, but HE had the good sense to use a pseudonym. I'd recommend this movie I guess (if you can find it), but I wouldn't bother with the sequel.",
