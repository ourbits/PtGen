    "introduction": "\"Janine\" is a spectacularly beautiful 89-minute documentary in which violinist Janine Jansen is followed for about a year by filmmaker Paul Cohen. We see the recording of a new CD of Bach, short talks with her, and mostly with her former boyfriend Julian Rachlin and a Russian musician, the making of the magazine Janine (one and only edition) for which also Roger Moore was interviewed, concert fragments and her travels, incl. Dubrovnik. It all shows what a virtuoso musician she is. But all this has lead to a break-down and she did not perform for quite a while afterwards. No info whatsoever about her private life. A question if she has a new boyfriend was not answered, but this is all about her music. I was utterly entranced by watching it all, sitting there on the top of my nerves, savouring it all in like never before. It got a short and very limited release in the filmtheaters (she was present backstage at the official premiere), but luckily the DVD will be released on 16 December 2010.",
