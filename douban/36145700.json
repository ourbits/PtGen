When all seems lost Ashley begins to hear the voice of a legendary jack-o-lantern named \"Trick\" (Malcolm McDowell) resonating in her head. But is this ancient pumpkin trying to help her? Is he just making things worse? Or is he merely the product of the young girl's panicked imagination? The \"trick\" is, figuring it all out - before everybody dies.",
