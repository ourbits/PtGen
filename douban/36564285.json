    "introduction": "A critical investigative documentary about the South African wine industry.In just ten years, imports of South African wine to Denmark increased by more than 78%. This daring documentary exposes how consumers are duped by different labelling systems that conceal practices of modern-day slavery and severe crimes against the environment: Pesticides are used without protection. Unions are denied access to their members, while the workers’ houses are falling apart. Twenty-two years after the end of apartheid, Westerners raise their glasses in a toast, while employers continue their profitable business by claiming farm workers as “the property.”Narration: David BatesonAdd. Narration: Anne HaubekProduced by Heinemann Media in corporation with DR, SVT & NRK[Credits](http://www.bittergrapes.net/credits/)",
