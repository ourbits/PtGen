    "introduction": "About a young man who seems to have it all: he’s talented, intelligent and attractive. Still, something feels permanently out of place, and he falls into commanding sadness. He can feel the desolation taking over when he receives a visit from a curious supernatural presence. Feeling strangely attracted to it, and with nothing to lose, he welcomes the ghost into his life. Could pleasure become a weapon in fighting deep solitude? Is there a place for desire in sadness?Call Me a Ghost is a trip into the darkest corner of our minds. It all starts with our protagonist, who’s going through an intense depression. One day, at home, he hears unexpected noises. In the darkness, under a cold white light, a smoking hot supernatural being rests. Is fear a stronger feeling than sadness? Is there a place for desire in the unknown? Could them, together, find pleasure?",
