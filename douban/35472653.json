Ebrahim’s mother hopes that one day her eldest son and her husband, who went to work two years ago and never returned, will return and the heavy burden of life will be lifted from Ebrahim’s shoulders. Apart from feeding the children and getting identity cards for them, Ebrahim and his mother are busy building a house in the village so that they don’t have to walk from the desert to the village every day. Eventually, they manage to build and move to their new house.",
