    "introduction": "If you like your ham hot and steamy with a sexy side dish of full-bellied laughter, come and dine at the comic feast laid out by the one-and-only Nick Offerman. Director Jordan Vogt Roberts (The Kings of Summer screened as Toy’s House in last year’s U.S. Dramatic competition) returns to the Sundance Film Festival for the second year in a row with this live taping of Offerman’s one-man show from the Town Hall theatre in New York.In Nick Offerman: American Ham, the humorist widely known for his breakout role as Ron Swanson in NBC’s Parks and Recreation serves up “10 Tips for a Prosperous Life”—tips that run the gamut from “carry a hanky” to “have a relationship with Jesus Christ…if it gets you laid.” And, of course, if it does get you laid, you can always use that hanky to clean up the spunk. These are but morsels in a full-on comedy banquet of philosophical anecdotes, irreverent songs, and practical woodworking tips served up saucy by one very talented comic ham, complete with minor nudity.- D.C.",
