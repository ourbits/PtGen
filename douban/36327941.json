    "introduction": "The mini-series 9/12 looks back at the aftermath of 9/11. After France loses two barrels of extremely dangerous chemical products during a secret operation in the Middle East, various traffickers find, buy and resell them from borders to borders on behalf of terrorists planning an attack in the heart of Paris. A anti-terrorist operation is set up to dismantle and prevent a catastrophe. At the same time, somewhere, hidden and off the radar, a man is watching. He is armed and his code name is Lynx. The countdown begins: the journalists investigate, the secret services track the terrorists who are preparing themselves when all of a sudden, Lynx starts to kill. We follow his journey and that of the four other main protagonists involved in this race against time.",
