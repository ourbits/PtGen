    "introduction": "1969. Adam is drifted into the Polish army and sent to serve in the submarine section of the Navy. Along with his older brother Antoni, Adam sets off for the military base in Swinoujscie on the Polish coast. Their journey across Poland lasts several days and brings about visits with old friends, as well as new acquaintances. Antoni's plan is to make sure that the trip prepares his brother for life in the army (including losing his virginity) to avoid becoming the laughingstock of the unit.",
