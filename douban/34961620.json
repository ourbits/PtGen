    "introduction": "At the Mosaik art studio in Berlin, artists with disabilities are absorbed in their work. Sabine Herpich observes the artists in the course of creation and directs her gaze at the institution itself: its processes, staff and spaces. The film succeeds in maintaining its focus on the art itself rather than the handicaps of its creators. It is around these works that the institution takes form, thus coming into view first and foremost as an institution for art, not one for people with disabilities. The idea of art becomes holistic, encompassing the people who make it as well as the places where it is created; it means looking at the works, and talking about them, but also art as work, complete with working hours and wage. The filmmaker herself is not invisible. She asks the artists about their thoughts, ideas, methods. As the artists before the camera meet the gaze of the filmmaker, a heightened sense of attention and sensitivity is produced – for the moods of the works, their creators and observers, as well as for this film about art itself, with its gentle, yet not timid, precise yet non-restrictive form.",
