    "introduction": "The fact that Pablo Casals was the first one to let Bach’s Unaccompanied Cello Suites known to the world and he studied techniques to play the cello as an instrument for solo put him into the position of the greatest cellist in the world. Since he first started playing the cello at the age of 11, he spent 85 years always with the cello until he died at 96. He was not merely a cellist, but humanitarians who tried hard to bring peace and love to the world with his music. This film, as the first documentary about Pablo Casals, flawlessly shows his lifelong struggle for democracy and peace against Francisco Franco’s dictatorship as well as the world of his music.",
