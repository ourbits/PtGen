    "introduction": "In this nearly dialogue-free film, the behavior of the local population during the advance of German troops into Yugoslavia is observed. In one scene, a village is being put to the torch and its inhabitants killed by the invaders. A man escapes the conflagration, but when it is clear that he is about to be caught by the Germans, he arranges to die rather than submit to them. In another scene, a young German soldier who is part of a firing squad sent to execute some Yugoslav partisans puts down his gun, strips off his military paraphernalia and moves across to join those about to die.Yugoslavian filmmaker Predrag Golubovic first found critical favor with his short films and documentaries. A former student of literature, Golubovic studied drama at the Academy of Theater, Film, Radio, and Television and then went to Paris to complete his film studies. Upon returning to his native country, Golubovic worked as a film critic. His first screenplay was produced in 1964, and he made his first documentary short, Nedelja/Sunday, in 1967. Golubovic directed his first feature, Bombasi/The Bomardiers, in 1973. In addition to his many directorial duties, Golubovic was appointed head of the Film Institute in Belgrade in 1980 and is a noted film theoretician.",
