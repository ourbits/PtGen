    "introduction": "FROM DARKROOM TO DAYLIGHT explores how the dramatic change from film to digital has affected photographers and their work. Photographer Harvey Wang, who began taking pictures as a teenager, was mid-career when the tools of his craft were made nearly obsolete with the transition to digital. Wang interviewed more than 20 important photographers and prominent figures in the field, including Jerome Liebling, George Tice, David Goldblatt, Sally Mann, Eugene Richards, Ruud van Empel, John Cohen and Jeff Jacobson, as well as innovators Steven Sasson, who built the first digital camera while at Kodak and Thomas Knoll, who along with his brother created Photoshop. Much of Wang's work has been about disappearance--of trades, neighborhoods, ways of life--and to live through this transition in his own craft has enabled him to illuminate the state of the art as both a photography insider and a filmmaker.",
