    "introduction": "A weekly talk/comedy show hosted by Dennis Miller. Each show starts off with a topical monologue typical of evening talk shows. After this, Dennis goes into \"The Rant\" in which he talks about some subject that bothers him, starting calmly but gradually building into a frothing, expletive-laden fenzy, then ending with \"that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.\" He chats with a guest for a few minutes, then finishes with a news segment similar to his \"Weekend Update\" role on Saturday Night Live.",
