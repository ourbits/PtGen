    "introduction": "Working as a domestic helper, Nargis looks everywhere to find out whether her husband Manzoor, who was arrested after joining the armed rebellion, is dead or alive. She is fired when her employer learns that Manzoor is a militant. She returns to her hometown, and Yaseen, who has feelings for her, offers help. Then one day, Manzoor comes home, and the three of them experience subtle emotional changes. The Winter Within is set in Kashmir, where small and big skirmishes and terrorist activities occur frequently due to the long conflict between India and Pakistan, as well as the border dispute with China. Exposed to violence and facing ever-present threats, the people of Kashmir live on silently, but it is not easy to maintain their everyday life. Nargis’ face full of many different emotions and the landscape of Kashmir in everlasting winter are the story and the theme of this film.",
