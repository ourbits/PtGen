    "introduction": "The dream of a different life: two drifters, off to see the world. An older and a younger woman are driving across the country in West Germany for a perfume company. But they have enough of their daily routine. So they decide to take their life in their own hands. They become robbers to realize their dreams: a place in Bali or an apartment in Paris. Christian Petzold’s perfect debut in feature-length film develops the overall design of his cinema for the first time, and with a sleepwalking certainty. A world where lapidary gestures are trying to hide the deepest melancholy and where characters try to override their inner stasis by an outward moving on. A word where all the sadness of existence gets comprehensible – and bearable by a laconic sense of humor.",
