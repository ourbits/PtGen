    "introduction": "During the 70´s this documentary was used in Argentina as a example of what you can do with good film language. The use of present, past and even future in the story was analized as interesting editing, and the different changes of colour were considered outstanding. The sound also was considered as how to change the sequence by using different sounds, and obviously the absence of any text was considered by students in those days as the utmost in the documentary genre. The camara work was admired especially because in the days when the short was made, no steady-cam existed and everything depended on the capacity of the camareman.",
