    "introduction": "This is a unique collection of broadcast TV footage -- live on-the-street coverage, interviews with participants and others (playwright Eugene Ionesco appears briefly), news anchor-style presentations, and announcements of heads of state -- from the period surrounding the December 1989 uprising in Romania.This footage is raw material reminiscent of the images that served as the basis for Harun Farocki's Videograms of a Revolution (1992) already on the tracker here.  The footage here is a bit more raw than that in Farocki's film.  It ranges from low quality to medium quality footage, with Romanian TV station insignias present in the corner of most of the footage.  There are a variety of formats and resolutions.  Aside from marches and interviews, one TV segment covers the execution of the Ceausescus themselves, an event which lead to much speculation and conspiracy theories.",
