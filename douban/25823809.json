    "introduction": "Rudy ransacks his sister’s bedroom to prepare for the role of a lifetime; 45 year old dry cleaner from West Ham, Suzie Lovitt. Banal every day objects; his mothers makeup bag; images from television; accents he has heard, are now transformed into a glowing inner-life. The family living room becomes a glittering stage, all silence becomes applause and all boredom transmogrified into Techicolored amusement.Childhood tedium is escaped as glamorous journeys are taken through Paris and guitars are smashed in a frenzied climax, all in the evening sunlit bedroom world of a child’s imagination. With make-up on the mirror and clothes upon the floor, Rudy’s fantasy takes to the stage where no-one can ignore him any longer.",
