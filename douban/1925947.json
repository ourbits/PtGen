    "introduction": "\"Taratata is a tribute to the parades that used to be held on Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, Quebec's national holiday. These parades were an occasion to honour traditional values or demonstrate progress by way of allegorical floats. Presented each year on June 24 in cities and towns all over Quebec, they gave local musicians and brass bands a chance to display their talents. Children adored the pageant with its splendid uniforms. The day would end with a great fireworks display. I wanted to evoke this popular celebration once again, emphasizing what was charming, ridiculous or pretentious.\"F.B.",
