    "introduction": "In an atmospheric short taking place on a sticky summer’s day in Singapore, Kerri, our central protagonist, is fretting about spending time at her friend’s house. Specifically, it is the pool, as she has been invited to dive in. With the fast moving currents of adolescence whipping around her due to a growing awareness of changes to her own body and the perceptions of others, she is reluctant. However, her friend’s sister, Clara, gives her confidence in a way. Is it admiration or a crush? Being brave, Kerri swims into those currents to get closer to Clara and we see how she grows.Drawing upon her own background, director WONG tells a story of girlhood via the central protagonist’s growing self-consciousness and resistance to the pressure of others as she finds the courage to take ownership of her oncoming womanhood. This sensitive story was captured by an all-female production crew.",
