    "introduction": "根据巴西作家Helena Morley的自传小说改编成的这部影片堪称巴西版的 <假面>, 与伯格曼的名作同样讲述两个女人之间复杂的情感关系. .. 是60年代CINEMA NOVO的重要作品之一.The first feature of filmmaker and critic David Neves, an influential voice in Brazilian cinema, Memories of Helen is \"precise, literate, intensely romantic... Two girls—Rosa and Helena—grow up together in an old town in Minas Gerais. Their story is framed by home movies that Rosa took and later shows to her boyfriend in Rio. The home movies, like faded family snapshots, provide an objective commentary on Helena's snugly enclosed world (peopled by cats, her faithful nurse, a deep attachment to Rosa) that is smashed open by a rich, spoiled young man who takes her up and then leaves. The two girls are beautifully characterized, the photography exquisite; the film itself is spellbinding.\" (Michael Webb, AFI) \"Memories of Helen is primarily an exploration of one woman's mind... Helen is a character full of fascinating complexities, partially liberated, partially the victim of romantic innocence. This story of a profound friendship between two women is reminiscent of Bergman's Persona.\" (Steve Mamber, Filmex '71)",
