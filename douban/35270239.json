    "introduction": "A few words on-screen introduce an enigmatic character: Hector is recently separated, grieving, angry – and wearing medieval armour. We then see a succession of impressionistic shots, labelled only with their location, map coordinates and, sometimes, an activity. Filmed near Rimouski, this short film by Sandro Aguilar invites us to enter the mind of a man who has cut off ties with the world. An anxious soundtrack overflowing with intricate details forces us to reconsider each shot, each moment. Are we taking Hector’s perspective? Are we watching an endless hallucination? Working with minimal resources, the filmmaker creates a world, a fascinating elliptical narrative that captures a certain sensory and emotional discombobulation that Hector is far from alone in feeling.
