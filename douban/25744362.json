    "introduction": "The Great North Korean Picture Show is a look at the film industry in one of the world's most secretive, oppressive countries. The film attempts to be as respectful as possible to the wishes of the subjects, without compromising the filmmakers' journalistic integrity. There is no narrator, allowing the people we meet to tell their own story. Whether or not they believe in everything they say is up for interpretation. There's no doubt that the North Korean government thought that this film could be used to share their own political and social views with the rest of the world. Upon viewing this film, I found myself feeling a profound sadness. It's as brutally honest as the subject matter would allow the filmmakers to be. That's a scary thought.",
