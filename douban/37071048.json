    "introduction": "SynopsisMi-Rae, a lively and curious little girl, is on vacation with her family in Rome. Upon reaching the St. Peter’s Basilica, the child remains in awe of the words spoken by a priest: “Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you”. These words will lead Mi-Rae to make a gesture filled with hope.COMMENTARYFilmed inside Saint Peter’s, the short film by the Manetti Bros. contains a message of hope and solidarity and was made for the first World Children’s Day.DIRECTOR'S STATEMENTPope Francis has often repeated that children are an example to follow, a hope for the future, for this world in crisis that adults are incapable of managing. We have thus chosen to portray children not as victims that must be protected but for once, as heroes and examples to follow.",
