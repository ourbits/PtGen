    "introduction": "A Walk In The Park is, in the words of it's protagonist Brian Fass, 'a science fiction film, a psychedelic journey back to the womb...' This documentary-like journey, cinematically speaking, progresses from non-fiction to fiction, and dizzyingly, dazzlingly back again. It is an ironic biopsy of truth, depression, addiction, family relations, ambition, retribution, violence and poetry. The picture evokes the closed-system mysteries of the mind, its wormhole logic, language and behavior, as a kind of Rorschachian jigsaw puzzle, a vertiginous descent into the abyss of self. The picture means to re-define the documentary genre, to make it real.",
