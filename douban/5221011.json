Eugenie's cousin, Charles, is the bearer of a letter from his father to his uncle, Eugenie's father. The letter informs the miser that Charles' father, his only brother, is reduced to a state of utter ruin, and unless he can obtain immediate help, he contemplates suicide. Charles does not know the contents of the letter, and when he learns of his father's misfortune he is overcome with grief, and both he and his cousin Eugenie plead with the old man to render aid to their relative in distress. However, the miser is deaf to their entreaties. Eugenie's heart is touched, and going to the hiding place of her father's wealth, she takes a casket, marked Eugenie's dowry, 200,000 francs. She takes this sum from the casket, and in secret offers it to her cousin, stating that her father has sent it to help his unfortunate brother. Charles immediately departs and reaches home in time to save his father ...",
