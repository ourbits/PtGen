    "introduction": "Sophie has been sleeping in her car. In it is everything she owns, but in an envelope in her glove compartment is a ring she bought for her fiancé. After an undisclosed amount of nights, she finally reaches out to her cousin, who seems to have it all in place- a house, a career and of all things, a wife. The cousins discuss their current lives in depth, leaving Sophie to feel disconnected and inferior to Jerzy- who is trying to bury himself in a cocoon of work, a job where he has control. But even that is unraveling. With Sophie thrown into the mix, they're forced to air out their differences. All the while Mary examines her own marital conflict with Jerzy.",
