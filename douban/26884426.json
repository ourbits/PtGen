    "introduction": "In one of the biggest half-hour sales so far this season, ABC has landed a family comedy from Black-ish creator/executive producer Kenya Barris and co-executive producer Vijal Patel, which has Emmy winner Felicity Huffman attached to star and executive produce. The single-camera project about a politically divided family hails from ABC Studios, where Barris and Patel are under overall deals. The big commitment, a rarity for a deal between a studio and its sister network, underscores the competitiveness of the sale.Written by Barris and Patel, the Untitled Political Project (fka Libby & Malcolm) is a family comedy that takes a very real look at how today’s “politics of division” play out between two opposing pundits who also happen to be married. One’s black, one’s white; one’s left, one’s right. Bitter rivals at work on their pundit show Black & Wright, they have to turn conflict into compromise at home when it comes to raising their kids. Huffman will play the wife.",
