    "introduction": "\"Nurses\" follows the professional and personal lives of four female colleagues who have very different ways of coping with the challenges of life in the trauma ward. While dealing with the life-and death cases every day, the nurses must also navigate rigid hierarchies, out-of-touch administrators, and surgeons who don't see the actual people they treat. With determination, strength and a very black sense of humor they achieve the weird, challenging, and amazing task of saving lives in a system that sometimes seems designed to do the opposite.",
