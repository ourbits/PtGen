    "introduction": "The teenage Leo (Tim Oliver Schultz), Jonas (Damian Hardung), Emma (Luise Befort), Alex (Timur Bartels), Toni (Ivo Kortlang) and Hugo (Nick Julius Schuck) would probably never have come together under normal circumstances. They all have their individual wishes and concerns. Leo loves playing football with his friends, but his mother has cancer. Jonas also has family problems and is regularly terrorized by his brother. While Emma suffers from an eating disorder, Toni tries desperately to find friends. But his Asperger syndrome does not make it easy for him. Everything seems to be going great for Alex, but that too will change soon. Hugo is the youngest of the six and just wants to make the leap from the ten-meter tower. When he finally dares, he ends up in a coma. Leo, Jonas, Emma, Alex and Toni suffer fateful blows that put their previous problems in the shade. On their way to the hospital the young people do not suspect that they will find friends for life.",
