    "introduction": "SynopsisA young man from the country who is living alone in the city, scours the classifieds section in order to find a job. He has a crush on his landlord’s daughter but doesn’t say anything to her in his shyness, and also keeps failing to get a job. One day, in a park, he picks up a wallet, which a drunken man dropped, and runs away with it. He runs into the landlord’s daughter and goes to a cafe with her where he opens the wallet. But in it are only a piece of newspaper from the classifieds section and a resume.NotesThe movie takes a satiric look at Korean society of the 80s. It has no dialogue, and the story is told through music and images, borrowing elements from a variety of genres to create interest.(Excerpt from a booklet accompanying a DVD, “Recollections of Seduction, Independent Films Vol.1 70s-80s”)",
