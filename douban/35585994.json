    "introduction": "Paul (Greg Hovanessian) and Rob (Dempsey Bryk) come from different backgrounds. Paul is rich, reckless, and left to his own devices, while Rob is a sensitive kid, close to his working-class family. Rob’s father, Rueben (Greg Bryk, BITTEN, BLOODTHIRSTY, THE LOST SYMBOL), toughs it out as a baker and runs a boxing club where Rob and his uncle Tom (Noah Dalton Danby, SHE NEVER DIED, BITTEN) train daily. They want Rob to make it as a boxer, and he has the physical strength and prowess to do it, but not the will. After being pummeled one drunken night while clubbing, Paul decides to take up boxing with an oldtimer coach named Lou (Michael Ironside, TIN CAN, KNUCKLEBALL). The sport is an outlet for Paul’s frustrations, something to make him forget his privileged background and soon makes him a formidable opponent—good enough for him to enter the world of bare-fisted fighting. With every TKO, his defeated opponents bring him closer to a life-changing crossroads with Rob and his family.",
