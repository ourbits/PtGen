    "introduction": "罗马尼亚儿童片导演Andrei Blaier的首部长片，64分钟，黑白。This movie is a good example of the communist propaganda being advertised in 50-60's Romanian movies. The action takes places in a 30's Romania hit hard by economic crisis. The main character is a school teacher who gets fired from his job and struggles to make ends meet. His four year old cripple son really wants to have a ball(football) to play with. His father really wants to see him happy so he takes some money from his measly life savings and goes to town to look for a ball. Rain starts to pour down and the father finds shelter in a perilous place where he gets robbed of his money. In the next few days he desperately looks for a job but his efforts are in vain. He meets a group of communist party members who attract him to their organization. Along them, he participates in demonstrations on the streets that support the development socialist of the movement. One of his neighbors, also a communist buys a ball for the boy and makes his dream come true.",
