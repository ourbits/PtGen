    "introduction": "Blending elements of Gothic horror with the more contemporary ingredients of steampunk, THE ASPHYX has emerged from obscurity to become a cult favorite of the sci-fi/fantasy genre. Utilizing an experimental photographic device, a scientist (Robert Stephens) captures what appears to be the image of the Asphyx, the ancient Greek spirit of the dead. With the help of his adopted son (Robert Powell), he conducts further experiments and conceives of a way to harness the Asphyx and thereby gain immortality. But, as every visionary scientist should know, defying the laws of the natural and spiritual world unleashes dreadful consequences.",
