While struggling to find a way out with the help of Goat, Dalia must face the other characters, who will do anything to become the main characters of the book. She is the only one capable of writing the final chapter, though she doesn’t feel confident enough.Dalia has only 12 hours, a blank page, and a pen to complete the story. The adventure within the book leads her to discover who her father’s friends and enemies were.
