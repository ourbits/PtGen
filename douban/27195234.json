    "introduction": "Lemming or Burner — how will they remember you? Delete Beach is a futuristic tale set in the near future of a schoolgirl who joins an anti-capitalist resistance group. In a society in which carbon-based energy is outlawed but which continues to toil under the regime of expansion and growth, petroleum is the fighters’ refuge. They smoke it, squander it and hand over their bodies to the sea, to eventually provide fuel for future struggles. Inspired by idyllic Scandinavian landscapes and the eco-feminist themes which propose anime as a political genre, Phil Collins’ collaboration with one of Japan’s leading animation studios STUDIO4℃ (Tekkonkinkreet) and award winning composer Mica Levi (Under the Skin) brings to life a world at once familiar and disquietingly corroded, left unmoored of any certainty in an age after the end of oil.",
