    "introduction": "London. 2009, mid-October. Summer gives way to autumn and the city swarms with people sucking in the stale air. Cars sit and choke at traffic lights. Trains cough out passengers. Evenings draw in like shadows over lungs. Clubs and bars pump out their music in dying gasps. And there is news of a second mysterious death... Each victim asphyxiated, no strangle marks, signs of struggle or evidence of a drug overdose. Enter Police Detective John Franks \"someone wanted it to look as if each person had just run out of air whilst asleep in bed.\"",
