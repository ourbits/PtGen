    "introduction": "Nolan Ryan’s numbers tell a story, but numbers alone do not capture his essence. Flash-points have emblazoned him onto our sub-conscience: like pitching with his jersey covered in blood. Running a cattle ranch during the off-season. The iconic brawl where Ryan walloped the 20 years younger Robin Ventura. Despite mythical moments and statistical brilliance, Ryan’s career is a study in extremes. Not only does he hold the record for most walks and most wild pitches, but he’s also given up the most grand-slams and the most stolen bases. Many of today's baseball analysts don’t consider him to be among the greats. With all this in mind, where does Ryan fit in the ever-evolving game of baseball?",
