Out of self-defense, she kills the perpetrator, is arrested and extradited to the Netherlands.While her children are in shock that their mother is still alive, there are also quite some people who still have unfinished business with Carmen. Everyone is dragged into a roller coaster in which problems multiply at an incredible pace. Carmen will now need to put an end to her past once and for all to rescue her family.",
