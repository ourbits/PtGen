    "introduction": "The satirical Kingsley Amis novel The Green Man served as the basis for this three-part BBC2 miniseries. Albert Finney headed the cast as Maurice Allington, the libidinous, money-grubbing owner of a quaint British bed-and-breakfast hotel. In hopes of attracting customers, and also desirous of bedding every eligible woman in the region, Allington began spreading rumors that his hotel \"the Green Man\" was haunted by the ghost of a notorious 17th century occult scientist. The hero was hoist on his own petard when it turned out that the ghost actually did \"reside\" on the premises -- and with several companion ghosts in the bargain. The Green Man was originally broadcast from October 28 to November 11, 1990.",
