    "introduction": "The documentary challenges the official stance of the contemporary scientific community on the origins of man evolving from an ape and the supposedly gradual advance of human knowledge presenting archaeological discoveries that do not fit into the official evolution theory and even going as far as silencing and ridiculing those scientists. It points out that the all-important missing link between the man and the ape has never been found and what's been found was made-to-fit into the evolution theory ignoring simple scientific facts; it presents archaeological facts that humans and dinosaurs may have co-inhabited the earth and that several ancient civilizations are much older than previously thought possessing knowledge comparable to that of the modern man",
