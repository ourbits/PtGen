    "introduction": "The movie Windows is constructed from a series of short stories about love. Different couples of around 50 years of age, a different couple each time, stand by a window in a room, illuminated by Tel Aviv's brutal summer sun, and one member of the couple wants to walk out the door. The film reveals them as they stand and look out the window and say something about their lives. In these moments of introspection they either look deeply and warmly into themselves or conduct a superficial, irritated soul-search; both come from deep in their hearts. They refuse to let go of their anger, they refuse to let go of their truth, they can't even agree on the weather. Yet this is a film about love - because the protagonists love one another.",
