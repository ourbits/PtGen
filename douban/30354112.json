    "introduction": "An old comedian lies buried up to his neck in the middle of a desert. A strange woman bearing a nail-bat finds him and intends to kill him. To save himself, the prisoner lures her with mysterious words, distracting her with stories of a mythical threshold that holds the absolute truth. She is trapped by the words as she struggles with her own existential conflicts in a world where the boundaries between truth, lies, reality, and imagination are blurry. This bizarre situation detonates a monologue about solitude, emptiness, love, absurdity, fear of death, and the fragility of human passions.",
