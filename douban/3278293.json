    "introduction": "罗恰拍摄好友巴西著名作家阿马多的纪录短片。This film was commissioned by Glauber Rocha to be shown on television as a special programme on the great Brazilian writer Jorge Amado. It mainly consists in an extremely affectionate conversation about all sorts of things, shot in the writer's house in Salvador with his large family. Jorge Amado was also filmed in a bookshop during a signing session for one of his last novels. Finally, Rocha shot the premiere of Nelson Pereira dos Santos's \"Tenda dos Milagres\" in a Salvador theatre, a film based on one of Amado's most famous books, \"The Tent of Miracles\".",
