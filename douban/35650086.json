    "introduction": "In Memphis, one of the USA's most distressed city, the Stax Music Academy is an oasis. Founded in 2000, the Academy continues the legacy of Stax Records, the legendary 60s soul label which was a refuge and an active space for dialog during the Civil Rights movement. By learning and understanding soul music in after school programs, teenagers embark into Black Americans legacy and open themselves to new future prospects. Soul Kids is a musical odyssey through history and the concerns of a new generation.",
