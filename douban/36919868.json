    "introduction": "\"The Emerson String Quartet records their last album, Infinite voyage, in three days, after 47 years of music together. For this farewell, the string quartet invited soprano Barbara Hannigan to join them, and a film was born.Their precise, inhabited work, the moments of enthusiasm and fright, the research and the jokes, the evening meals and the morning confidences, the age limit of these men and the flamboyance of this woman nourishing each other, the admiring friendship full of irony and joyful rigor, the craft and yet the discovery, the humor as a cog towards concentration, the individual and the group… all this composes a portrait of the usually invisible making of music.Before everyone goes their own way.\"",
