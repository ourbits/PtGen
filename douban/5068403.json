    "introduction": "The story of Strauß' operetta is a pretty elaborate tale of the usual mix-ups and wrong identities taking place on a grand ball and in prison reading a synopsis on wikipedia gives a good idea for the start. There are however some additions, noticeably a clever story within a story element. The music is obviously fine though sparsely used, the comedy stuff is not always that funny. But there is glorious Agfacolor, stars like Fritsch and Heesters as well as lively supporting comedians like Kreysler, gorgeous sets and costumes and a rousing camera travelling towards the end along the orchestra.The film was shot during the Third Reich, but the editing was finished after the war was over and the considerable success of the film helped Defa to much needed capital gains and a start.",
