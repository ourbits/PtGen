    "introduction": "Boylan (Absolom), a serial killer, has been captured and is being held in police custody. He gives the police a website address and a passcode which shows a girl, the Boylan's eighth victim, in chains, and a timer counting down from 30 minutes. Cathy Lyndon (Oberman) tracks down the address the domain is registered to and finds the room the girl is in, but it has a time lock on it. Boylan and James Matheson (David-Lloyd) watch as the countdown reaches zero. The locked door opens and chains tear her limbs from her body before she can be saved. Boylan gives Matheson another passcode, which displays Matheson's daughter similarly chained at another location. After locking the interview room door and turning off the surveillance camera, Boylan tells Matheson he has a code that can save her life.",
