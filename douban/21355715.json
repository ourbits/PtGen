    "introduction": "After she crossed the border to the South alone during Korean War, Seon-Hee voluntarily takes a part in a service for an orphanage. She faces various difficulties while she takes care of orphans. However she endures all the hardships with belief and home for bringing up orphans. Two troublemakers Jae and Kwang become college students thanks to her efforts. As Kwang loses his eyesight during students activities against the government in 1960, Seon-Hee gives him one of her eyes. When Seon-Hee goes to prison instead of her adopted daughter Suk who incidentally committed a crime, the orphans who grew up as good civilians appeal to the court for her innocence. In the end Seon-Hee comes back to them and dies.",
