    "introduction": "Kay Gray is a young girl growing up in an entirely grey house in a totally grey world with very, very, grey parents. However, her house gets infested with ELEPHANTS. They can't be seen against the grey walls, and crash around in the middle of the night, and leave massive piles of dung in the loo. Kay's unloving parents make her paint the house with brilliant colours, so that they can see these pests. When Kay corners the Elephants, they become friends and she decides to help them.",
