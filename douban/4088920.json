When he goes to Kka Chi Island to give medical treatment to an old woman who is dead before he arrived, he meets her niece Seok-Hwa, a deaf mute and blind girl, and takes her with him. He makes all his efforts to make her an ordinary person. Hyeong-Jun makes Seok-Hwa, growing to be a young lady, to feel beauty of the world and he also feels love towards her. Therefore he opposes to his son Je-Ku's love for Seok-Hwa. Later Seok-Hwa regains sight by an eyesight recovery operation but she is troubled between Hyeong-Jun and Je-Ku. In the end Je-Ku takes his way to be a priest and the clergyman is too old and wretched. She finally commits suicide because she can't love either of them.",
