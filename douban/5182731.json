    "introduction": "Turin(Italy),1940.Jazz music is banned as 'esothic vehicle' and menace to Italic melody. When the Hitler Alliance gets tightened,what's coming from US is mocked by the Regime's 'culture'; restrictions limite possibilities of playing it in front of an audience.GIO CERVI,MOLAIEN and the band,the musicians in this Story who play against those rules,are object of a discrimination;they represent a sad scapegoat of what Intolerance can bring to.MASSIMO,a young boy who follows them,is not guilty the same;but an irrational thirst for revenge flows over them with no matter.They're put in an horrible jail for three years,and at the end they're brought to die because of a judicial mistake;but also because of a Repression,out of Ages or Hystorical content,which should invite everyone to think.",
