    "introduction": "In the late 60’s, Júlio Machado works for the itinerary library of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. His job is to take literature to the small villages in the Alentejo. Books pile up in his van, as he crosses the golden planes of the region. People know him as “the book boy”. In his journeys through the Alentejo, he falls in love with Mariana, the daughter of a wealthy landowner, subdued by a spartan education. The father does not accept their relationship for he sees in Júlio all the evil of the city and the modern world that threaten his conventional way of life. But love flourishes between them and finds in books a chance for escape and happiness. Nicolau is our narrator, he will write this story.",
