    "introduction": "Tomas looks after Martin, who has end-stage Alzheimer's, in the care home. At the same time, Tomas has a relationship with Martin's wife Petra. In the nursing home, they conceal their relationship, which is characterized by routine. At Petra's home, Thomas discovers a piano piece that Martin was apparently playing. He begins to practise the piece in the clinic's recreation room and continues to approach Martin's life in his thoughts. When Petra catches him in Martin's clothes, a taboo seems to be broken. They confess their relationship to Martin and, to everyone's surprise, he reacts strongly.",
