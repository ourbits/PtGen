    "introduction": "The film \"The Nation and Destiny\" - the most ambitious project of the North Korean cinema. It consists of 13 independent storylines. Each plot is dedicated to a real person or group of people, which is reflected in the fate of the history of the Korean nation in the twentieth century. Since the film is still an art, character names changed slightly, but the events shown in it accurately correspond to reality.\"San Yuen Ming\" - (this film is completely independent and finished product). The prototype of the main character was the young and the San (1917-1995) - the famous Korean composer, who worked in Germany. In 1967, Yong and his wife were abducted by South Korean secret service and taken to Seoul. In connection with the so-called \"Berlin thing\" he was sentenced to death, but the broad international outcry helped save him. These events formed the basis of the plot. Read more about Yun and Sana'a and \"Berlin really\" see. KJNoh \"South Korea: republic of torture, republic of terror\"",
