    "introduction": "在上世纪80年代库卡卡曾经为他的同乡好友兼导演创作过两个电影剧本，这部《一个人的生活》就是其中之一，个人感觉这部以情动人的悲喜剧并不像库卡卡自己的玩闹风格，毕竟不是他导的，影片的悲剧色彩很重，涉及到的题材比较严肃。IMDB上9.5的评分不知是怎么弄出来的，其实没必要那么高。4/5推荐。A man's life falls apart after he quits his job at a sawmill, and subsequently kicks his wife and son out of the house. If Musa can only bring himself to stomach his work at the saw mill for a little longer, he will reach retirement age and will have a nice pension. However, a strike has brought home to him just how bad the wages and working conditions are, and he doesn't return after the strike is over. Meanwhile, his son has had no job for a long time but plays soccer all the time, when he is not wooing the girl who runs the newsstand at the train station. Musa is a bad-tempered fellow who quarrels often with his son. On one of these occasions, his wife throws both of them out of the house. Later she goes mad and then dies. Eventually, the son is arrested for a rape he didn't commit, but this doesn't stop the boy and his girlfriend from getting married, they just do it in jail. The father, left alone with his grudges and grievances, seems to collapse in on himself. This wonderful tragicomedy is wrote by Emir Kusturica.",
