    "introduction": "The Sputmik is missing and a hillbilly thinks that it had just fell in his backyard. He becomes famous and he and his wife are introduced to the 'High Society' while the CIA, the KGB and the French wants to lay their hands in the Sputnik, by all means necessary. That's the plot. What happens in the movie in fact is a series of jokes about the Brazilian High Society and how the world perceives the Brazil. It's plenty of stereotypes, true, but this is also part of the fun (Jo Soares as a CIA agent who can't stop chewing chewing gum and Norma Bengel as B.B., sexy French agent, are memorable). Lots of funny moments all along the way including its purposely 'open end'.Carlos Manga's comedy O homem do sputnik (1959) represents a significant shift in his attitude towards Hollywood, Brazilian cinema and his own identity. He had become aware of the fact that the influence of American cinema had in some ways been detrimental to his own career, admitting that: \"nao era a minha raca, o meu país - entao me revoltei contra isso\" (Manga 1983, 30).",
