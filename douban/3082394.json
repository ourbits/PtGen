    "introduction": "Every POV tells a story. BLOOD RUSH is unlike any other crime series on TV. Boomtown meets CSI, it reinvents the genre. Truth is slippery. One man's testimony is another's man's lie. Evidence appears to be definitive - but in whose hands? With whose construction? There's never only one version. The truth depends on where you're standing. How many points of view make the whole story? A distinctive and gritty multi-angled drama, BLOOD RUSH uses breakneck jumps of viewpoint and the time-frame to uncover crime stories from the points of view of everyone involved. Chronologies are rolled backwards, forwards and overlapped as the story unravels. The diverse perspectives of detectives, cops, forensic scientists, pathologists, profilers, victims and perpetrators take us deep into the heart of the story. And finally to the truth. THERE'S ALWAYS MORE THAN ONE PERSPECTIVE TO A CRIME. EVERY POV TELLS A STORY.",
