As well as their UK success the band were huge in the USA – notching up ten top 40 hits.Being part of Band Aid cemented them as stalwarts of the ‘80s, a band that broke down barriers and left a huge legacy for the stars that came later, before they disbanded in 1986. However they were a band with a troubled past, George had an affair with his drummer Jon Moss and when they acrimoniously split, the band fell apart and George descended into heroin addiction.",
