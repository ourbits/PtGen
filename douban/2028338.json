    "introduction": "Dim witted Dong-chul (Kim Myeong-kon) roams the streets of downtown Seoul wearing the clothes and watch left behind by a film director (Lee Jang-ho) who committed suicide. One day, he sees a pretty college student named Hye-young (Lee Bo-hee). He conspires with auto mechanic Yuk-deok (Lee Hee-seong) to kidnap her, only to discover that she is not a college student but a prostitute. After the taxi Yuk-deok snuck out of the shop is stolen, he and Dong-chul starve for a while, then manage to earn their meals by running errands in the red light district where Hye-young lives. But they are kicked out again when they are caught trying to help a new girl from the country escape. Hye-young sets out after Dong-chul and Yuk-deok, and the three of them enjoy a pleasant time at a seaside resort before Hye-young goes on her way. While working as waiters at a saloon in Seoul, Dong-chul and Yuk-deok run into Hye-young, who is there as a companion for one of the guests. During the ensuing party, Hye-young becomes the plaything of the upper-class men in attendance and eventually loses her life. Dong-chul and Yuk-deok deck her out in fineries and carry her out on their shoulders to bury her.",
