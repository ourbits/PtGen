    "introduction": "Syria is dominated by the Romans. During a summit of Tibullo, Jezel and Tisba, two very skilled thieves who \"work\" in the crowd, are pursued by some guards but are able to escape. Jezel takes refuge in Ammon's potter's house and invades his daughter, Miriam. As old Mannaen kidnaps the girl, Jezel and Tisba save her and go together in a cave, shelter of Syrian rebels. Near is the legion of the Vitellio console and the two thieves steal the imperial insignia. Mannaen, to attract the romance's sympathy, reveals their refuge and, after a furious battle, also Jezel is imprisoned. Condemned to death because he does not want to reveal where the insignia is hidden, he is about to be baptized when Tibullo recognizes his son in him, kidnapped him by the pirates.",
