Their own family is on the verge of being torn apart by racial tensions and the only person in the family trying to hold it all together is the mother, Karen. She has to deal with her layabout armchair politician husband, Tony, who makes a joke about everything. Her daughter, Serena, who no longer speaks to dad because she's fallen in love with an Indian from Neath. And her son, Steve, who's nearly thirty, still living at home and secretly a racist BNP thug. 'Little White Lies' deals with the rise of the BNP, the politics of hate, the paranoia of racism and how it effects this Welsh family.",
