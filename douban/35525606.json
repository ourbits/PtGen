When he found out that his father plans to marry a young girl, he was very upset. So, he left the palace to do farming with his helper.Jitree told Taddao that her father left a will hidden somewhere in Bussaya House. Taddao decides to run away from this forced marriage and go in search of the will. Since traveling alone is not safe for a young girl, Taddao's nanny, Tiang, helps her disguise herself as a boy named Sutad. They happen to run into Prince Yodkwan, himself preparing to hit the road. When Taddao, disguised as the boy Sutad, discovers that Prince Yodkwan is a friend of Witoon's, her stepmother's brother, she asks him to take her along to Bussaya House. Prince Yodkwan agrees to help, under the condition that Sutad obeys him and do everything as told, without troubling the bossy and uptight prince.",
