The Colombian shantytown of La Estrella is a poor but close-knit community with many quirky and lovable characters. For years, the population has been awaiting fulfillment of government plans for establishing electrical service in their neighborhood.In the tradition of \"The Gods Must be Crazy\", La Estrella's access to modern conveniences upsets the social balance of the community. A series of pranks escalates the comedic tension to hilarious levels, culminating in a showdown between Technology and Tradition.Starring the studly Manuel Jose Chavez as Edison and the luscious Paola Rey (of the hit soap “Pasion de Gavilanes”) as Giovanna, COMO EL GATO Y EL RATON / A GAME OF CAT AND MOUSE is sure to please audiences of all ages.",
