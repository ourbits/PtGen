    "introduction": "Starting his career as assistant director for famous names like Im Kwon Taek and Bae Chang Ho, Kwak Ji Kyun made a splash in 1986 with Wanderer in Winter. For his debut film, Kwak teamed up with Bae Chang Ho's longtime collaborator Choi In Ho, who wrote Bae's most successful films of the 1980s like Whale Hunting, Deep Blue Night, and Do the Right Thing. The film also features Bae's muse, top actor Ahn Sung Ki, along with Lee Mi Sook, who previously worked with Ahn in Whale Hunting, Kang Suk Woo (Stranger), and Lee Hye Young (Between the Knees).Paving the way for Kwak's later melodramas like Portrait of Youth and Plum Blossom, Wanderer in Winter is a story of youth and struggle, reflecting on the hardships of the time and the universal themes of love and sorrow, desire and desperation. The film follows four young people - Min Woo, Da Hye, Hyun Tae, and Eun Young - whose lives confusingly cross paths. For Min Woo and Da Hye, first love leaves just as quickly as it comes when Min Woo ends up in prison. Upon release, he loses himself in a military town and meets street girl Eun Young, disappearing completely from Da Hye's life. Without Min Woo by her side, Da Hye comes to rely on Hyun Tae, who is torn between his feelings for Da Hye and his friendship with Min Woo",
