    "introduction": "For 25-year-old Sebastian it is all about surface and appearance. Life is full of party, money and one-night stands. He has never challenged himself, whether it be his dream of a music career or maybe, especially true love. When everything is at its best in his superficial life he has an accident that leads to him becoming blind. A whole world closes, or rather opens up. When he sees everything in black, he meets Mia, a personal assistant. A girl he normally would not pay any attention to. She becomes the first to successfully open his eyes to what is important in life. But when Sebastian discovers that Mia is not who he expected superficiality gets an entirely different meaning. EGO is a romantic comedy drama about vanity, love, sex, and that things are not always as they seems.",
