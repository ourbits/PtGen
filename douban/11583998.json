She has two things that are tearing her up inside: She and her husband aborted a long-awaited pregnancy because they found out the baby might have birth defects, and she ignored Chul-min’s misfortune and he committed suicide. Yeon-soo becomes curious about a girl named Anna staying in Yeon-soo and Chul-min’s old room#313. Strange things begin to happen as Anna and an odd couple, Joe and Park come to the motel.",
