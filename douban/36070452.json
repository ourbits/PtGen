    "introduction": "Father, mother and son seem very distant from each other. the director, Jules Carrin, suggests this from the beginning, with a long, still, wide-angle shot. Jonathan is not allowed to be with his father, nor does the boy seem to find consolation from his mother to whom he is completely indifferent. In the suffocating heat of a campsite in the heart of a mountainous gorge, around a river, Jonathan thus spends the summer days in solitude. When he decides to go beyond that river, the Styx, the \"river of hatred\" he will find a hell of psychological constraint and violence. Filmed with a single sequence shot, the work seems to allude to getting lost in the \"dark forest\" to then find oneself, across the river, among devils or other damned of Dante's Inferno. Finally, in the large artificial reservoir of the river, returning to a distant and motionless shot, perhaps the protagonist has found something of himself. Or he is continuing to search.",
