    "introduction": "MIHAI and MIHAELA, a married couple with a 10-year-old son, are visited by ANA, a prostitute who reminds them about things from the past: a car accident that they had tried to hide. Ana is smart and manipulative, she blackmails them and asks for one thing in exchange for her keeping the truth a secret: she will take Mihaela’s place for one day, wear her clothes, be called Miha, and sleep with Mihai. The two spouses try to reject her proposal and chase her away, but that turns out to be quite hard to achieve, when one is blackmailed. The couple’s life is turned upside down, because each of them has something to hide, each of them fights for survival. And anyone feels entitled to kill in order to survive.",
