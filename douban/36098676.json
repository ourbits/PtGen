Prabhu is standing for election as the village chairman in Vaghachipani and is hellbent on winning. Bhandari is his subordinate. Basu, a snake catcher, is not convinced by Prabhu and announces that he will reveal his dark secrets to the village. Paathi, the orphan shepherdess, is discovered to be pregnant and her employer, Prabhu, is accused.Venkati, step-brother of Prabhu, is in love with a girl from a lower caste. He is asking for his share of the ancestral property. Cornered from both sides, by Basu and Venkati, Prabhu decides to use his minion, Bhandari, to do what is necessary. He orders Paathi to be eliminated and blames her pregnancy on Venkati. Bhandari executes the task of eliminating Paathi, but discovers that it was Prabhu who actually impregnated her and not Venkati. As Venkati is arrested by the police, Prabhu manages to the win the election. Bhandari's rage leads to a confrontation at the Tiger River. As Bhandari takes Prabhu down into a swirling whirlpool in the river, dusk descends and the roar of the distant tiger can again be heard.",
