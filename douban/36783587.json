    "introduction": "A tale of revenge that has stood the test of time, Shakespeare’s classic tragedy is reimagined for the modern day as a gripping psychological thriller! Transcending the confines of the stage, the film utilises nearly every room of the Theatre Royal Windsor to transform it into the immortal Elsinore Castle, from basement dungeon to roof-top battlement. The critically acclaimed, recent stage cast of ‘Hamlet’, including Ian McKellen, Frances Barber (King Lear, Chekhov’s The Seagull) and Jonathan Hyde (King Lear, Titanic, Crimson Peak), bring their iconic roles to life in this compelling new film adaptation.McKellen reprises his lead role as Hamlet, a man who descends into madness as he seeks vengeance against his uncle for the apparent murder of his father. Further cast includes stars of stage and screen, Jenny Seagrove, Steven Berkoff, and BAFTA-winner Francesca Annis.",
