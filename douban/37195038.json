After releasing 'Resurrection' (2000) Halford screams through a 95-city, world-wide concert tour. The band's final-tour performance at Brazil's Rock in Rio III (2001) festival in front of more than a quarter-million Metal fans presents an up-close view of one of Metal's hardest working and innovative bands.",
