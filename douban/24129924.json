    "introduction": "Doctor Lubomir Kanov is a famous Bulgarian psychiatrist and a writer. When he was 33, he was arrested by the Bulgarian authorities and thrown into prison for anticommunist propaganda and because of his intention to leave illegally the country. Today, Dr. Kanov, in his own words, is a two-humped camel. In one of the humps he is carrying Bulgaria with all the sorrows and joys he has experienced there, in the other is his life of a psychiatrist in New York. He has forgiven everybody, the informers as well as those who gave witness against him fearing for their own life. He has not forgiven only the torturers and the executioners, because, in his opinion, only the man who has repented of what he has done has the right to be forgiven.",
