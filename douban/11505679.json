Here, a group of youngsters are about to take the leap in the adult age, while the ground literally trembles under their feet. From the winter cold to summer greenery, they will fight with themselves and the world around them, learning to live, love and dream - while the city also is in a time of change, forced to move elsewhere due to the explosions mining the ground.",
