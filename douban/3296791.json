Anxious to be reconciled with his child – who reproaches him for his absence (the mother having died in the interim) – the father tries to teach him some values and buys a piece of land in order to plant a vine. However, the son totally rejects this paternal figure and the tension grows further when the father starts a relationship with his former wife’s sister.",
