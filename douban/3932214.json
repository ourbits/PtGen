    "introduction": "Surely you remember hearing about the illusionist who made the entire Eiffel Tower disappear in one of his shows? If you ever wondered about that, or about the magician who pulled off the stunt, perhaps you have what it takes to watch this surreal and nonlinear film, which explores the life, career, and downfall of the Argentine magician Miguel Quiroga. In the story, we discover that Quiroga (Carlos Roffe) had a difficult childhood. He sought solace from it through books, which he would steal and read from cover to cover when he should have been sleeping. One day, he discovers a book full of magic tricks both real and imagined, and the future course of his life is set. His only fear is that someone will find and widely publish another copy of this, his life's sourcebook and inspiration.El Acto en cuestión (English language:The Act in Question) is a 1994 Argentine film directed and written by Alejandro Agresti. The film starred Carlos Roffé and Sergio Poves Campos. The film was also released in the Netherlands and Portugal. This movie was partly recorded in a castle in Oostakker near Ghent in Belgium (1992). The family \"De Bruyn\" who owned the castle, played as observers in the movie.",
