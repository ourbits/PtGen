    "introduction": "Clara embarks on a trip with her boyfriend, far from the city. Talks about shows, warm beers and local rock songs are interrupted by a message from Martina, a friend with whom Clara was the day the República de Cromañón club caught fire, which ended the lives of 194 young men and women. As she notices that the echoes from the tragedy still resound in her present, Clara begins to reconsider her future. From then on, a creative project about her -and her friends’- teenage years and the idea of becoming a mother invade her everyday life. These plans, even if they don’t end up becoming a reality, mean defeating that night in which time came to a still for an entire generation. But even in those crucial instances, Clara understands that, as her idol Pity Álvarez recites in the song present throughout the entire film, it’s time to take a break and think clearly.源自：https://www.mardelplatafilmfest.com/38/en/pelicula/clara-se-pierde-en-el-bosque",
