    "introduction": "Eleonora Duse was and still is an icon. A unique talent who has left us with no records of her voice and presence. Pictures, fragments of gestures and movements, description of her acting, are the only “images” of her. Despite her absence, she’s has been a never-ending source of inspirations, her acting inspired both Lee Strasberg’s and Stanislavskij’s acting methods. To this day she remains an icon and example to actors, directors and artists alike, almost 100 years after her death. In first person actress Sonia Bergamasco leads a moving peer to peer investigation on Eleonora Duse, the greatest actress of all times, whose legacy revolutionized acting as we know it today.",
