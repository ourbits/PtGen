    "introduction": "This Christmas, wildlife cameraman Gordon Buchanan is travelling to the frozen north, deep inside the Arctic Circle, to meet the ancient Sami people and the animals they hold so close - reindeer. Known as the reindeer people, the Sami were traditionally nomadic, relying on their precious animals to help them survive the Arctic's harsh winters.Gordon lives with a Sami family in Finnish Lapland to experience their unique culture and to learn about their special bond with reindeer. He works to earn the trust of his own reindeer companion, before leaving behind his adopted family and setting off alone into this land of ice and snow. With only his reindeer to guide him, but armed with the knowledge of his hosts, Gordon wants to immerse himself in this frozen wilderness and attempt to witness the natural phenomenon the Sami most revere - the magical northern lights.",
