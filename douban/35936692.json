    "introduction": "There's a massive student loan crisis in America. Millions have found themselves buried beneath a mountain of debt. Entire generations are trapped. Borrowed Future uncovers the dark side of the student loan industry and exposes how the system is built to work against you. We meet a group of high school students as they're about to make one of the biggest financial decisions of their lives, and then the other side: the reality for adults living with student loan debt. Do 17-year-olds really understand their financial decisions today will affect the future in front of them? Borrowed Future proves that you really do have the power to beat the student loan system - but it's up to you. You get to decide to feed the system or fight back.—Ramsey Solutions [us]",
