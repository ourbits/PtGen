    "introduction": "Mitt offers a refreshingly candid view of the private moments of a major presidential contender. The film invites the audience into the room with Mitt Romney and his tight-knit family during his two recent attempts to gain the presidency.A notably private person, Romney was conflicted about putting his wife and family through the rigors and exposure of mounting a campaign. After Senator John McCain defeated him in the 2008 primary, it seemed unlikely Romney would run again. The story picks up four years later as Romney secures the Republican nomination and faces President Obama in their first debate.Director Greg Whiteley was granted unprecedented access to the presidential hopeful and his relatives. Rather than focusing on the candidate’s platform or tactics, the film concentrates on off-the-record discussions between Romney and his closest family members. Moving beyond politics, Mitt elegantly reveals the human and often-hidden side of a public figure.- L.V.",
