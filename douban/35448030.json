    "introduction": "Uncompromising, multi-awarded actress, Simone Signoret told herself in 1976 in a book (\"Nostalgia is no longer what it used to be\"). She also answered with refreshing frankness to the thousand questions of journalists on subjects as varied as the profession of actor, her roles in the cinema, her conception of political commitment, the couple or the passing of time. Thirty-five years after her death in 1985, Michèle Dominici composed from archives, interviews and excerpts from her films the portrait of an actress who refused to be a star all her life, an activist who was never cast, an artist who made the choice of love and freedom.",
