    "introduction": "It doesn't matter if, with tragic or successful outcomes, most of the stories of mountain adventures go down in alpine history as heroic tales. This is also the official version of the first ascent of K2, the second-highest mountain in the world, by an Italian expedition in 1954. It is hardly known that behind the fame of the first ascent is a story of slander. In his new documentary, Reinhold Messner is showing how fast camaraderie can turn into insidiousness and sets out on the trail of the expedition's great loser: Walter Bonatti. After a series of accusations and discrediting attempts by hiscomrades, Bonatti was officially rehabilitated in 2008. What really happened and how Bonatti received justice in the end is told by Messner in an exciting interplay of archive material and re-enactment scenes.",
