    "introduction": "Brighton-based British indie filmmaker Jamie Patterson turns his genre-hopping talents to the rom-com for this brash and breezy take on the end of an affair. Chris and Lucy are cut adrift in their thirties struggling to remember what initially attracted them to one another and wondering where do they go from here. Cue an impulsive decision to spend a fortnight interrailing around Europe's most romantic destinations, in the hope that this might save their seemingly doomed relationship. What ensues is a comic treat as Chris and Lucy tear the last scraps of meat from the carcass of their love affair. Patterson's eye for comic absurdity and ear for the petty barbs of couples' conversations make TRACKS an uproariously funny antidote to the simpering romanticisations of BEFORE SUNRISE.",
