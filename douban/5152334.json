    "introduction": "In 1957 Buenos Aires, Sylvia Hermann, the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, began dating Nick, a fellow German-speaking student at her high school.  Little did she know that Nick was the son of the notorious Adolf Eichmann, who had been living under an alias in Argentina since 1950.  When her father makes the connection, he notifies Fritz Bauer, the state public prosecutor in Frankfurt, who in turn contacts Mossad, Israel's secret service agency.  A carefully choreographed plot by intelligence agents ensues leading to the spectacular capture of Hitler's right-hand man in 1960.  Award-winning director Richmond Ley crafted this docudrama using historical footage and extensive interviews conducted with Eichmann in Argentina by former Dutch journalist William Sassen.",
