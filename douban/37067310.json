    "introduction": "The documentary retraces Calvino's life through the theme of cities with an alternating narrative between the \"visible\" cities in which he grew up (Sanremo), lived and worked (Turin, Paris, Rome) or that struck him on his travels (New York) and the \"invisible\" ones invented for the famous book published by Einaudi in 1972: the former are described through an important selection of archival material (period films, interviews, photographs) and the monologues by Filippo Scotti, Alessio Vassallo and Valerio Mastandrea who play Calvin in different moments of his life, while Violante Placido is entrusted with the task of bringing The viewer inside the dream and fantastic dimension of invisible cities against the background of more abstract scenarios. The two dimensions intertwine creatively to create a story-telling that returns that sense of fantastic reality that is at the base of Calvino's works.",
