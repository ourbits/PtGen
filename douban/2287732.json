    "introduction": "Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi is an Annie Award-nominated Japanese-American animated television series produced by Renegade Animation for the Cartoon Network. The show was created by Sam Register, who also serves as the series' executive producer. According to Register, the target audience of the show is boys and girls from six to sixteen years old. However, the show also has a following of fans of the real-life Ami Onuki and Yumi Yoshimura who make up the J-pop duo PUFFY, known as \"Puffy AmiYumi\" in North America. Register, a fan of the band, wished to spread its fame to other parts of the world and thus produced the cartoon.[citation needed]The series features the adventures of animated versions of the band. It has been immensely popular in Japan since making its debut in 1996. The group now has several U.S. albums to its credit - including a 2004 companion album to this program - and was known to viewers of Cartoon Network in the USA for performing the theme to the animated series of Teen Titans comics.",
