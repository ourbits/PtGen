    "introduction": "The Berlin piano maker Jan Epstein knows exactly what to do when it comes to restoring the highly sensitive instruments. As a small business owner, however, he is at least as unsuccessful as in his role as a family man. Jan secretly mourns the failed marriage with the concert musician Serafina and he has to make amends with his 16-year-old daughter Mia. An unexpected opportunity arose when the teenage girl, surprisingly, wanted to accompany him to Italy for a lovingly repaired piano. On the way, Jan notices what really made her travel with us: a large portion of reluctance to move with her newly in love mother and her fiancé Einar. In addition, there is lovesickness, which Mia wants to cure with distraction. Despite the adverse conditions, Jan decides to turn the delivery into a short break with an open ending. Jan prefers to suppress the fact that his girlfriend Stef, who wants to nail him down with plans for the future, and the bailiff are waiting for him at home, in the tried and tested manner. Because of his unreliability, a worried Serafina soon turns up at the holiday hotel, naturally with Einar in tow to check on Mia. Now Jan sees the chance not only to fight for his daughter, but also for his ex-wife.",
