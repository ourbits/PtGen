    "introduction": "Feketeország is a theatrical event created by the hungraian group, Krétakör (Chalk Circle). It's about the dark, satyric and grotesque world that we live in (in Hungray, that is). The performance is based upon those 160 character short mesages about daily news, that the director recieved on his cellphone. These messages also inspired the actors performance, creating an absurd, musical feast.The performance was shown in Budapest 24 times - every one of them was sold out. Feketeország was also selected for the National Theatrical Festival in Pécs (POSzT), where it won an award for best theater group. After showing a huge national success, Feketeország went worldwide to show its irregular image of Hungray.",
