    "introduction": "Old police cases never die, they just get filed away to a  place  buried  deep  within  the  bowels  of  PoliceHeadquarters.  This  is  where  Detective  Jack Kempson (Colin Friels) has been sent after blowing the  whistle on  his colleagues.  For anyone  else this  would be  a death sentence. For Jack, it's an opportunity-a  chance to bring old cases back  to life, and bring to  trial a whole lot of people who thought they got away with  it. To  pull  this  off  without  support  from  colleagues requires cunning, humour, some useful alliances and the  ability to tap into resources not normally used in your standard police investigation. And that is exactly  how Jack likes it.Ten years ago, a baby was killed in a house arson  fire after a  violent home  invasion. The  parents used  the tragedy as  a motivation  to help  build an evangelicalcommunity church but now  the mother has comes  to Jack for help. Jack agrees  to look into the  still unsolved crime but in  looking for the  truth Jack will  have tofight the system  and his own  conscience to uncover  a tangled web  of lies  and deception.  In the  end, Jack  must  decide  if  the  truth  should  prevail  over theinterests of the innocent.",
