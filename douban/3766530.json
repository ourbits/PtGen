    "introduction": "Gunnar Papphammar (played by Gösta Ekman, in my opinion one of the finest actors ever to emerge from Sweden) is a corny middle aged man who always seem to end up in the most strange situations; some by accident, some on expense of his own clumsyness.This was originally a TV series and I am not sure weather these scetches and clips are collected from that show. \"Från och med Herr Gunnar Papphammar\" is in any way one of the most hillarious collection of bits I have ever seen, so funny and surreal in its accurate portrayal of social situations most people dread, that I had to make my own subtitles and share it with you.I hope you give this a try and please feel free to comment on what you thought. This is a cult classic in sweden. It is definatley not for anyone, but those of you who appreciate it will laugh your asses off.",
