    "introduction": "Bolzano, Southern Tyrol. Though part of Italy, many speak German here. It's a city with two faces. On one side, those of German heritage - precise, rigorous, and well off. On the other, Italians - loud and passionate. But both sides are equally shaken when a ruthless serial killer comes back, targeting German-speaking victims. He has been active years ago, when Paolo, an Italian police inspector, lost a leg and his girlfriend trying to catch the \"Monster of Bolzano\". For Paolo, it has become a personal obsession. He has to join forces with Eva, a young and ambitious assistant DA of German origin. Her father used to be the DA on the same case - now she must prove herself. Eva also has an obsession, one that has nothing to do with the case: defending a young artist called Mathilde. But what is it with the young woman, that has Eva risking everything for her? Only one thing seems for sure: The monster will strike again.",
