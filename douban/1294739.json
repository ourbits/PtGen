    "introduction": "This is one of the most wonderfully cartoonish and over-the-top spaghetti westerns ever.Sabata is an excellent combination of western action, acrobats, fancy gadgets, humor, good music and clever camera work. The acting by Lee Van Cleef and the rest of the cast is top notch.Van Cleef, a great character actor has incredible presence yet never upstages the other actors giving the cast an ensemble feeling rather then a one man show.The clever editing, fluid camera work, and color photography in Sabata is super. The film is extremely stylish and purposely tongue in cheek, highly entertaining, imaginative, and funny.The plot - A trio of city-big-wigs attempt to empty the bank. Sabata finds out and blackmails the buch. The trio sends more and more bad guys to dispatch Sabata (Blazing Saddles Style). With each attempt the henchmen are bumped-off (in increasingly funny and imaginative ways). After each attempt Sabata ups the anti. This continues until all hell breaks loose in a wonderfully filmed Indiana Jones style shootout.The music score is excellent, especially the title tune, which is one of my favorite spaghetti western theme songs. I also really like the use of the organ in the score. It's a nice touch.All spaghetti western fans should have this movie. It's a classic of the genre.",
