    "introduction": "The story introduces Ibrahim (played by Moussa Sylla), who arrived in Spain a few years ago from Guinea but now his roots are in Madrid, where he lives with Mariama (Nansi Nsue), and he works as a bricklayer. One day he is arrested by the police and, as he does not have a residence permit, so he is deported to his home country. From then on, his only goal is to return to Spain to be reunited with his partner and a daughter who is soon to be born. After making it across Africa, the man stays with some fellow travellers on Mount Gurugú, a migrant camp that separates Africa from Europe. In Nador he meets Aminata (Edith Martínez), a girl determined to jump the fence and reach Spain, but this physical feat is not possible for everyone: many never make it, others die in the attempt and only one woman has succeeded to date.",
