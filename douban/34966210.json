    "introduction": "John Buffalo Mailer, son of the iconic author Norman Mailer, is partnering with Hivemind, Washington Place Productions and Mailer-Tuchman Media to create a limited series based on his father’s novel The Naked and the Dead. The deal was brokered by UTA. The partnership is packaging the project and seeking a top showrunner.Hailed as the first novel to come out of World War II, the critically acclaimed epic enjoyed 62 consecutive weeks on the New York Times Best Seller. The Naked and the Dead was based on Norman Mailer’s experiences during WWII. The story follows a platoon of Marines who are stationed on the Japanese-held island of Anopopei. It was adapted into a film in 1958 which was directed by Raoul Walsh, but the TV adaptation will be an opportunity to put the story on a larger canvas.",
