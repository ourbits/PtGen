Oscar-nominated screenwriter Terence Winter (The Wolf of Wall Street, The Sopranos) is set to adapt the non-fiction book into a limited series.Published in 1992, Den of Thieves (which has nothing to do with the action-thriller of the same name starring Gerard Butler) tells the story of the massive insider trading scandal that brought down Drexel Burnham Lambert as well as ending the careers of Wall Street heavyweights Ivan Boesky and Michael Milken, who recently received a full pardon by Donald Trump.",
