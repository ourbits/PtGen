    "introduction": "ESPN once televised a football game between IMG, one of America's most prominent high school teams, and the unknown Bishop Sycamore. The game ended with a score of 58-0 and a blowout by IMG that endangered students’ lives. People began to ask, “Who is Bishop Sycamore?” as news came back that the school used college-age players who shouldn’t have been eligible to play — and that Bishop Sycamore wasn’t even a real high school. From inquiries made by the Ohio High School Athletic Association to the journalists digging in, this truer-than-fiction story questions the entire business model of amateur sports.Directed by Martin Desmond Roe and Travon Free, and featuring interviews with players, families, coaches, and the team’s controversial head coach Roy Johnson, this film captures your attention and searches for answers.源自：https://tribecafilm.com/films/bs-high-2023",
