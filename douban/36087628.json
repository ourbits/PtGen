There are three people in the nursing home of Masa Toea: Grandma Ani, Grandpa Farid, and Oma Ida. The three are taken care of by Rina, a nurse who is also Agus's girlfriend. Not long after Ambar and Dika's move, Oma Ida's grandson, Arthur, comes to celebrate Eid. Ambar, who has the ability to see mystical things, accidentally gets a vision from the past: Ivanna, a Dutch woman, was tortured by Japanese soldiers which resulted in losing her head. A series of mystical events begin to haunt Ambar and all the residents of the nursing home, especially after they find a headless statue in the basement along with a vinyl record containing a scary song. On the day of Eid, things got even more tense when the residents of the orphanage found that Granny Ani has died without a head. Everyone panicky, especially when one by one the mystery of Ivanna's revenge is revealed. With the safety of all the residents of the orphanage now in danger, Ambar is required to finish Ivanna's revenge, before the spirit takes their lives.",
