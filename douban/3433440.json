    "introduction": "The film is the full story of Florencio Parravicini, one of the greatest comedy actors in the 20th century's first half. He also was a shooter, a dancer and a varieté showman. The movie begins at Flop's birth and we can see the boy growing and living some experiences that make him embrace his vocation. Then, he obtains the fame and he enjoys it, although everything is not joy in its life. The story is driven in a unique style with sarcasm and transgression.This film is carefully designed to please local fans of the beloved Argentine stand-up comedian, stage performer and magician Florencio Parravicini. His stage name was \"Flop.\" Florencio's father was a prison director, and he was raised among prisoners from the age of seven. Moments from the performer's stage shows are interspersed with shots showing his backstage life, and flashbacks which illustrate his early life.",
