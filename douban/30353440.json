    "introduction": "On the specific request of the Art Gallery of the Barbican Centre, Ila Bêka and Louise Lemoine, internationally known for their unique take on architecture, have settled for a month in the heart of one of the most impor-tant european art centre and most representative achievement of Brutalist architecture.The film, built as a personal diary, recounts on a daily basis all what the directors duo have discovered during their urban trip from the top floors of the towers to the underground levels of the art centre.Through an impressive gallery of portraits, the film draws an intimate human map of the place, breathing life into this harsh district and questioning the durability of this utopia from the 50s.",
