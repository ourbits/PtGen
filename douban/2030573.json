    "introduction": "Karate Kommandos (also known as Chuck Norris: Karate Kommandos) is an American animated television series from the 80's. It originally aired in 1986 as a syndicated five episode mini-series. It was created by and starred Chuck Norris as himself, and produced by Ruby-Spears Productions. This fictionalized version of Norris is a United States government operative with a team of \"radically diverse\" warriors. The team includes Pepper, a technology expert and mechanic; Reed, Chuck's young apprentice and Pepper's brother; Kimo, a samurai; Tabe, a sumo champion; and Too Much, a young ward. Together, they fight against The Claw and his right-hand man, Super Ninja.The series follows the framing device of Mr. T's animated series ( also a Ruby-Spears production): At the beginning of each episode, a live action segment with Norris, usually at a Gym or Martial Arts Studio, is shown to explain what is going on. At the end of each episode, Norris narrates a moral lesson for the audience to learn.There was also a comic book series published by Star Comics, an imprint of Marvel Comics which produced comic books aimed at young children.",
