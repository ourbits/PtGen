    "introduction": "Off-grid is not a state of mind. It is not about being out of touch, living in a remote place, or turning off your mobile phone. Off-grid simply means living without a connection to the electric and natural gas infrastructure.From 2011 to 2013 Jonathan Taggart (Director) and Phillip Vannini (Producer) spent two years travelling across Canada to find 200 off-gridders and visit them in their homes. They met off-gridders in every single province and territory and through their film they narrated our travels and chronicled in depth the experiences, challenges, inventions, aspirations, and ways of life of people who have chosen to radically re-invent daily life in a dramatically innovative but also quite traditional way.",
