    "introduction": "Poppy animation combines stories about a Buddhist elephant, a social media-addicted chicken and a tree trunk with an insect phobia. Artist Wong Ping was inspired by his own everyday observations. He deals with personal issues including digital contact, physical love, narcissism and fear shamelessly and with biting humour, all in neon colour. Ultimately there is a moral to this fable.",
