    "introduction": "Nobody goes into a film called Failed Emptiness expecting an uplifting message of hope. Finnish multimedia artist Mika Taanila expunges all optimistic sentiment from this moody procession of images, music and on-screen text. There is the thinnest filigree of narrative – rituals of domestic life, an individual seeking and losing their identity in the crowd – but the plot deliberately breaks down into a series of abstract impressions. An apocalyptic ambience is transmitted to the viewer. The text, by poet Harry Salmenniemi, appears as conventional intertitles for a while but then takes on a purely graphic form, its accumulated meanings scattered to the chill wind.",
