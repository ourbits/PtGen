    "introduction": "A corruption scandal pushes the De Moya family to go spend some time away from the public eye in the coastal town of Las Terrenas. For Sarah and her nanny Yarisa, it is a defining moment. Sarah is desperate to get away from the life that her family imposes on her in Santo Domingo, and as an avid free diver, she longs to be near the sea. Down there, in the quiet underwater world, she finds shelter. For Yarisa, this move means returning to the village where she is from, and to her daughter, Mallory, whom she had to leave in the care of family members 18 years ago. Now she must face the ghosts of her youth and the stormy relationship with her family and Mallory. Sarah has always wanted to be like Yarisa, to look like her, to be her daughter, that's why she is fascinated to meet Mallory, a 19-year-old girl who overflows in youth all of Yarisa's energy. In order to please her and assuage the strange moment Yarisa is living, Sarah invites Mallory to a party.",
