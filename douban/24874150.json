    "introduction": "Sami hilariously transforms into acutely observed and very different characters all living in our country's super city. In season two, Ofa is a welfare case-manager demanding everyone follow in her footsteps out of poverty. Levi is a new half-back in his South Auckland rugby team and desperate to be one of the 'boys'. Ray is a mechanic juggling his small business with his wife's bodybuilding training. Mary is an ambitious rocker desperate to escape from Howick but denigrated to singing pub gigs. In season one, there's Pasha, an aging cheerleader clinging to her partying lifestyle; Azeem, an immigrant taxi driver embracing Maori culture; Jo, a closeted gym instructor in love with her best friend; Linda, the runt of her \"old girls\" clique fostering impoverished artists and Georgie, a homeless girl whose freedom is unexpectedly interrupted.",
