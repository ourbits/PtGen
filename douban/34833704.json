    "introduction": "Filmed on four continents, this astonishing documentary illustrates how bodies of water serve as connective tissue between cultures, allowing seemingly disparate experiences to reflect one another. Rightfully giving sound designer Benoît Dame equal billing with director Dan Popa, Symphony is an extraordinary sensory experience that proves both lyrical and elemental. As we wash ashore on beaches, cut through arctic waters, and witness the artistry of fishermen, the sea never ceases to inspire awe. -- From viff.org",
