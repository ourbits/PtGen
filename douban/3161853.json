Guja is a farmer and grofgebekt type, but in the inside pocket of his jacket, he lovingly a mus. The classy Trifona gives itself as a celebrated singer and telling his curious travelling on successful performances in exotic places and beautiful theatres. Guja annoys occurred during the trip enormously to the stories of the distinguished Trifona, of whom he considers to be a swindler. He asked in ever coarser words Trifona to stop the telling of nonsense, but Trifona is defended by the whole coupe during a handgemeen. If on the next day the men together again take a new confrontation is inevitable, but it appears that the roles reversed.Temur was born in 1948, in Georgia, and studied Film at the University of Tbilisi. He directed his first fiction film in Migration of Sparrows (1980). In 1993, he directed The Sun of the Sleepless, awarded the Silver Bear at Berlin Film Festival. His son Gela was born in 1979, in Tbilisi, Georgia. He moved to France when he was 17 years old. 13 (Tzameti) was his first feature film, awarded with the prestigious Lion of the Future at the 2005 Venice Film Festival.",
