    "introduction": "Moose populations across many parts of North America are in steep decline and scientists believe one of the reasons is that fewer moose calves are surviving their first year. This stunningly intimate nature documentary, filmed over 13 months in the spectacular wilds of Jasper National Park, takes viewers deep inside the world of moose to experience a mother's love and a calf's first year of life up close and personal.",
