    "introduction": "90后还记得小时候的广告“好记星”吗？这部纪录片向我们介绍了一位来中国学习中文的加拿大学生马克•罗斯韦尔，也就是我们后来所熟悉的大山。一次偶然的机会让他可以出演一个很受欢迎的电视节目，他在节目中表现出来的对语言的掌握让观众眼前一亮。因此，他在中国成为了一名出色的喜剧演员。影片探索了他在中国独具特色的喜剧事业，而他本人也因此用一个他从来没有想过的方式加深了他对中国和中国民众的了解。This film explores the life of Mark Rowswell, a Canadian student who went to China to study the languages there. A chance encounter landed him an opportunity to appear on a popular TV show where he dazzled the audience with his command of the language. As a result, he has become a popular comedy star in that country and we explore his life in China as he develops a successful career in the distinctive verbal comedy style of the region. In doing so, he has learned more about China and its people in a way he never thought possible for him.",
