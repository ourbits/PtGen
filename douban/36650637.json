    "introduction": "The project documents the perseverance of a mother and her son from the Ewenki ethnic group, the last hunting tribe in China, in their forest way of life amidst the process of modernization. The project began in 2004. In 2003, namely a year before that, the government issued an order to collect all hunting guns owned by the Ewenki ethnic group. The loss of hunting guns caused great sorrow for the hunting people, as it meant the disappearance of their culture and way of life. The entire Ewenki ethnic group’s survival, cultural inheritance, and the reindeer’s survival environment, which are the focus of the project, still face severe challenges.源自：https://crossinfilms.com/sales/feature-films/work-in-progress/son-of-forest/",
