Director Chris Paine (Who Killed the Electric Car? 2006) has had unprecedented access to the electric car research and development programs at General Motors, Nissan, and Tesla Motors, while also following a part time electric car converter who refuses to wait for the international car makers to create the electric cars the public demands. As more models of electric cars than ever before start to arrive in showrooms and driveways across the world, Chris Paine's film offers an inspiring, entertaining and definitive account of this revolutionary moment in human transportation. Revenge of the Electric Car follows these auto makers as they race each other to create the first, best, and most publicly accepted electric cars for the new car market.By 2006, as many as 5,000 electric cars were destroyed by the major car companies that built them. Today, the electric car is back... with a vengeance.Without using a single drop of foreign oil, this new generation of car is America's future: fast, furious, and cleaner than ever. Narrated by Tim Robbins, and from the director of Who Killed The Electric Car?, the film goes behind the closed doors of Nissan, GM, the Silicon Valley start-up Tesla Motors and an independent car converter to find the story of the global resurgence of electric cars, following the race to be the first and the best, and to win the hearts and minds of the public around the world. It's not just the next generation of green cars that's on the line, it's the future of the automobile itself. \"Revenge tells the story of that rare moment when the bottom line finally dovetails with the greater good\" (Village Voice).",
