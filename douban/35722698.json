    "introduction": "Marriage, once dictated by strict and uniform rules, now takes on many shapes and forms in this era of rapid social change in Kosova. Weddings and Diapers brings four couples of different regions and generations to share how they deal with chores, child raising, freedoms and infidelity. Inviting the camera into their homes, they reveal the subtleties of their relationships with honesty and humor. How have roles changed and what are the limits to modernity in the sacred union of marriage? From milking the cow to a lesson in diaper changing, watching home wedding videos to the birth of a new baby, and a unique look at the disappearing tradition of polygamy. It’s all a part of the intimate ride we call love (and everything that comes with it) in Weddings and Diapers.",
