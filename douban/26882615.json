But when Sophie casually makes a wish upon Star for a date to the Valentine's dance, her wish comes true in the form of Drake, a famous upcoming actor from Los Angeles. Now, stressed-out Sophie must find a way to get the wisecracking Drake back to the bright lights of the city before he's stuck in small-town America forever...but she just might learn a whole lot about herself, including how to have fun again, along the way.",
