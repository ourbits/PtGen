    "introduction": "Everyone and everything is a story, but what about finding the right words? This is something that fifteen-year-old Murra discovers while travelling on a photo-excursion for disadvantaged youth through the ancient natural landscapes of her Aboriginal homeland. In the course of one eventful week of wild camping and wandering through historic Indigenous sites, Murra reconnects with her ancestral roots, makes friends for life, experiences the disappointments of heartbreak but discovers also her love for photography. As the camera and the images she creates calibrate her with a fresh point of view to the world, Murra sees new possibilities for her future. Sweet As celebrates resilience, growth, hope and love and the importance of finding one’s very own voice in the process.源自：https://www.berlinale.de/en/2023/programme/202315222.html",
