    "introduction": "Ryszard Czekala's first color film. Of the more renowned Polish animators,his films are amongst the darkest and most mordant in tone.'The Autopsy' is a non-linear series of fragmented chiaroscuro images, the meaning of which can only be pieced together upon the film's conclusion. Technically ingenious and visually inspired, the film is a combination of multi-plane paper animation mixed with physical objects and light effects to create an extraordinary sense of depth.",
