    "introduction": "A 19 year old nonconformist poet living in 1947 Czechoslovakia is blind to the Communist behemoth looking over him, and instead lives a bohemian life with sexually liberated girls. There he writes lyrics for many of the underground rock band hits by 'The Plastic People of the Universa', a group heavily influenced by Frank Zappa and the Velvet Underground. Written by IMDbPrague 1947 - a time of sensuality, extravagance, wit and great expectations . Ivan Heinz, a good-looking dandy with a provocative sense of humour has just turned 19. Running away from home he devotes himself to the celebration of freedom, revolutionary politics and artistic aspiration. He lives for the moment, discards the past, writes poetry and blindly immerses himself in his own world of idealistic politics, surrealism and personal discovery. Written by Jasmina Torbati",
