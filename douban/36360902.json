    "introduction": "On the first day of December, Mie (12), Johannes (12), Elias (13), and Noor (13) all show up at a camp to attend a two-week course on astrophysics. The Astro-camp is led by the enthusiastic Bolette-Henriette and the daily curriculum is managed by the slightly distracted physics teacher Panda-Søren.The four children are paired up for an intro-run across campus, but quickly find themselves lost in the research department in the secret basement: a place that is absolutely off limits for the young students. Here they come across a mysterious machine and when Mie and Johannes try out its workings, they suddenly disappear without leaving a trace. Noor and Elias are faced with the ultimate challenge to bring back their friends: a quest that seems almost impossible, especially when they realize that Mie and Johannes have been teleported to the distant Planet 9.",
