    "introduction": "Olga’s political idealism and hopes for a better future are put to the hardest of tests. The authoritarian, omniscient communist authorities are determined to break down the actress when her father is in hospital fighting for his life, while her husband is in prison. Olga needs to find herself in a new situation and make an impossible choice. Every hour of delay may bring disastrous consequences. The film, set in the 1980s, includes both a social and historical streak. The authors were very attentive to detail designing the sets and costumes and the script includes questions worthy of the cinema of moral unrest. Olga herself is as resolute as Agnieszka, the protagonist of ‘Man of Marble’ by Andrzej Wajda. Does an individual have any chance to protect his or her loved ones and preserve dignity in the confrontation with the giant machine of power?",
