    "introduction": "一个剧院被大幅画布和纸质幕布覆盖。随后，一个身影开始剪裁出框架，呈现出一种关于可见与不可见的绘画游戏。《无处不在》抽象地展现了佐伊·本肖普（Zoey Benschop）在创作其2022年作品《Raamwerk》时的艺术过程。A theatrical place covered with large canvasses and paper strips. A figure cuts out frames, in an expressive interplay between what is visible and what is not. It is an illusion of two- and three-dimensionality, in this abstract impression of Zoey Benschop’s artistic process while creating her ‘Raamwerk’ in 2022. “As a spectator, you can see everything around you in a space, while in a film you only see a fragment. But imagine you are watching a film and you look outside now and then.”",
