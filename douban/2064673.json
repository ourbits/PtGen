    "introduction": "This was the second of the Russian Winnie the Pooh series. This one had Pooh and Piglet visiting Rabbit for a meal with honey. Pooh and Piglet eat lots of the stuff. So much of it that Pooh can't get out of the hole of the Rabbit's tree house. Rabbit and Piglet pull on Pooh's arms at the entrance so hard the tree falls down! As Rabbit ponders what happened to his home, Pooh and Piglet walk and sing as the cartoon ends. Another charming Pooh story interpreted by the former Soviet Union. Disney had previously done this as Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree.",
