They created democracy, art, science and medicine. They looked at the big philosophical questions that we still struggle with today. Yet, they have a pagan system with incredible myths and stories of gods and goddesses that have no evidential basis. Alice challenges and confronts the experts about these as well as trying to get to the bottom of the famous stories and story tellers like did Homer really exist and is the story of the battle of Troy in The Iliad false?",
