    "introduction": "The film \"Schwarze Sonne\" clarifies the influence esoteric ideas and myths had on the ideology of the Third Reich. At the beginning of the 20th century in Germany and Austria, many occultist and neopagan groups were established which, while misunderstanding and misinterpreting legends and symbols, professed the dominance of the \"aryan race\". Many among the Nazi leaders felt confirmed by those ideas, such as Rudolf Heß, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank or Heinrich Himmler. Through rhetoric, sacral architecture and spectacular mass rituals these pseudoreligious symbols were inculcated in the minds of the people. Among the tools for that process were light cannons, torch marches, solstice bonfires and the glorification of the ancient Germanic tribes in educational movies, schoolbooks and scientific journals.",
