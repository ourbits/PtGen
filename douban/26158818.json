    "introduction": "With 625 this idea is taken further still. The subject matter is television static, the title referring to the number of lines found on a PAL or SECAM set. Essentially the film sets up a conflict between the two mediums – the grain, flicker and occasional scratches of 16mm versus the video image. Especially pronounced is the competition between the frame rate of the former and the scanning frequency of the latter. To further enhance the effect, the Heins also present the film in negative, resulting in visuals that are even more abstract and hypnotic, and insist on a half-hour-plus running time which, under the circumstances, is positively epic.",
