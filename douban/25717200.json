    "introduction": "根据南非版的邦妮和克莱德真实故事改编，佘诗曼菲利普斯和彼得夫妻的1980年真实生活的犯罪故事。由德班缉毒警察调查，在德班有两对情侣被杀害，并把尸体抛弃在不同的地方。精明的德班警察通过闪存背上慢慢撕下画帖，真相终于慢慢浮现出来。Based on the 1980's real life crime story of the couple who became known as South Africa's Bonnie and Clyde, Charmaine Phillips and Pieter Grundlingh, Durban Poison tells the fictionalized story via a road trip during the police investigation, where the killing couple show the police the different murder locations of the four men they killed. The savvy police officer in charge does not believe their accounts of what took place and, through flash-backs that slowly peel away the masks to reveal the passions and wounds of Joline and Pieter, the truth finally comes out in a dramatic final beach scene.- Written by Judy Croome",
