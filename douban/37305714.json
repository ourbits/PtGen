    "introduction": "Remember waking up when you were 5 years old, just... excited to start the day? It was utter JOY. But then, you grew up. And between the pandemic, inflation, and our era's crazy politics, all kinds of things chipped away at that wonderful feeling: I call them JOY-SUCKS. JOYSUCK is Emmy nominated storyteller Kiran Deol's first original comedy special. Named one of Entertainment Weekly's Comics to Watch, and having acted on shows like Modern Family and How to Get Away with Murder, her signature pink jumpsuit clips have garnered millions of views online. From societal ills, to equal pay, to the perils of therapy, drugs, and dicks on your back, JOYSUCK laughs at the SUCKS and reclaims the JOY.",
