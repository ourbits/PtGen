    "introduction": "This short documentary about the Euchee (Yuchi) Language Project was produced by This Land Press and Sterlin Harjo and Matt Leach. It is filmed at the Yuchi House, the only place on earth where the Yuchi language is spoken on a daily basis by children and elders. The film gives a sense of our work and the way we are racing against time to keep our language alive. Several young learners and children speak the language and continue to learn from fluent elders in daily classes at the Yuchi House.",
