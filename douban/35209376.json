    "introduction": "Shot over five years, Into the Storm chronicles a scrappy Peruvian teenager who taught himself to surf with a broken board he found on the beach, and earns a spot at former World Champion Sofía Mulánovich’s surfing school. Reminiscent of Hoop Dreams, Into the Storm navigates the trials and struggles of Jhonny Guerrero as he hopes to lift himself and his family out of poverty by becoming a professional surfer.With his father in prison, and his cousin Martin already sucked into a life of crime at 14, Jhonny sees surfing as a chance to escape a similar fate but struggles with the pressures to succeed, compounded by the guilt of leaving his old life behind. Occasionally, his tough guy facade cracks open; his doubts and inner turmoil mirror the violent world he faces. The turbulent waves - the footage is stunning - are both his source of joy and a crucible where his future is decided. Into the Storm is an inspirational, empowering coming of age story.from viff.org",
