    "introduction": "关于非洲闪族人的纪录片，包括日常生活和狩猎。The Great Dance describes the life of the !Xo people of the Kalahari. It is told by !Nqate (meaning ‘always walking’) Xqamxebe, a San Bushman hunter. The film depicts the hunter’s skills in hunting and tracking, his traditions and beliefs, and the way in which his lifestyle is altered and compromised as a result of the impact of the Western world and modernity. This film seems to attempt to understand San cosmology. Great Dance gives an idea of the free, self-reliant lifestyle of the Bushman in the past, and the actuality of his life in the present.The film shows the San’s extensive knowledge of nature and how they are able to track animals by studying the faintest of prints in the baked earth. The hunter is shown to be tireless in his endeavours to feed his family. The hunting scenes also show the way in which the Bushman’s environment has changed and degenerated in recent times: “once we were near animals, now we must walk far to find them”.",
