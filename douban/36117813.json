    "introduction": "叛逆的Nghia（陈黎德饰）与朋友不学无术，在欠下赌债后，与父母发生争执并离家出走，但往日好友却都拒绝收留他。一个有抱负的剧作家Thien（阮伯荣饰）因父亲的欠条而允许Nghia以租客的身份暂住下来。虽然他们的初见并不顺遂，但朝夕相处后，二人关系日渐亲密。情愫发酵的背后，他们还面临着年龄差异、阶级壁垒以及对性向的困惑。Love Bill is a Vietnamese BL series about a runaway teenager and his older roommate. After clashing with his family, the rebellious protagonist deserts home with nowhere to go. An aspiring screenwriter allows the youth to live at his house as a renter. Although their relationship begins rockily, they build an intimate bond. As romantic feelings develop, they struggle with the age gap, class differences, and confusion over their sexuality.A triumphant entry from Vietnam, Love Bill offers a complex romance with compelling main characters. The series shines whenever it focuses on the charming rapport between the quirky, energetic leads. The talented actors deliver stellar performances in both comedic and dramatic scenes. Although the narrative is unpolished, this moving love story can be as emotionally powerful as the best BL dramas.",
