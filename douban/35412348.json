    "introduction": "Renzo is thirty years old and his family is a fan of the River Plate FC. In addition, some men in the family held high-ranking positions in the club. Renzo works of what he likes when he can and when he can’t he works as his brother’s assistant and gofer. Renzo decided to devote himself to art and his family became a stranger to him. He starts to review his story while he tries to learn to drive, establish a romantic relationship and write himself into that distant world. This is how Renzo draws a bridge from fiction to wander between his two dissimilar worlds.",
