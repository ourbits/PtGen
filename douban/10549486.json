    "introduction": "When you’ve found someone, how do you know it’s the right someone? This film about young New Yorkers in love follows several storylines of mutual friends as they try to find the answer to that question. Liv (Caitlin Fitzgerald) is engaged to Christoph (Cheyenne Jackson) while being pursued by Nate (Peter Scanavino), her best friend and one-time lover. Liv plans a surprise party for Christoph that brings many of the main couples together and into conflict over fancy cocktails, individual bags of chips, and a cake that wasn’t really what the hostess ordered. The movie depicts new romance, married love, and stories of infidelity, all while showing director Matthew Watts’s obvious appreciation for New York City in both settings and storylines. Quirky characters add to the mix and remind us that no matter how odd, there is indeed someone for everyone. There is a lot of laughter to be found in the pursuit of romantic happiness, and ultimately Mutual Friends comes to the conclusion that love isn’t as complicated as we think it is.",
