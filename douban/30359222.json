    "introduction": "Grimme winner Aljoscha Pause accompanied the world champion Mario Götze for 7 months with the camera. The long-term documentary shows not only Götze's everyday sporting life and his fight for a World Cup ticket. She also gives extensive insights into his private life. With numerous celebrity companions and relatives, the film looks back on the beginnings, the great successes and the crises of the Dortmunders, and for the first time also deals in detail with Götz's medical history. The 5-time German champion describes in detail and open as never before his view of football and life and lets the viewer guess what it means to be Mario Götze.",
