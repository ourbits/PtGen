    "introduction": "Documentary exploring the long-term multi-generational effects of the mass killings in Indonesia in 1965-66, where approximately half a million to a million suspected communists were killed in six months. Woven together are archival footage, photos, interviews with historians and anthropologists, and testimonies of both victims and perpetrators of the killings, revealing a complex story of politics, death, suffering, and coping.The film follows four families who had family members killed or \"disappeared\" by soldiers and neighbors in Bali and Java. The survivors and their children break the thirty-five-year silence as they reveal how they are still subjected to and cope with the continual harassment, surveillance, and discrimination by the State and their community members.Official Selection Globians, World + Culture Documentary Film Festival ; Official Selection Boston International Film Festival",
