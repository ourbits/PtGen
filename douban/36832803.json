The fearfulness Julia lives in daily is evidenced by the many activities she starts, but can never finish, dreading her father’s reaction. Albeit he is extremely controlling, Julia seems to be a sociable teenager, with a protective instinct, although traumatized by her family’s reality. She is a well-informed young girl, well aware of what she has to do in order to put an end to the toxic environment they live in. Will she be able to, though?",
