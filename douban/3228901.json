    "introduction": "Anna is married to her teacher, Professor. Their marriage is a mutual agreement with no great feelings. Marriage gives both a status they need; love must be found elsewhere. Roland is a young man, beautiful body, transparent skin, clear eyes, a keen mind for wisdom. He falls in love with Professor, a man older than Roland's father. Affection grows to be mutual. Roland is eager to give all he has to give, he even tries to be a part of the family. When he finds out that there is no family, his focus is Professor and his happiness. This elder man is also intellectually highly affected by the love Roland gives. They have beautiful conversations, the likes that we seldom hear in movies anymore (not even in books). They speak of virtue, honor, love, affection, and integrity, which are all the cornerstones of their relationship. But they don't speak of flesh. Professor nearly faints down when he sees Roland's bare breast since the beauty of youth has its own reasons and own power. He listens behind Roland's door as if to get a non-physical touch of that beauty. The story is really intense and when the separation of those two is evident, not only Roland is in tears; anyone who remembers will shed tears for his or her own dreams that did not come true.",
