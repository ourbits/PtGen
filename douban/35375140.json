    "introduction": "In January 1948, a few months after co-founding the internationally renowned cooperative photographic agency Magnum Photos, Henri Cartier-Bresson traveled to Delhi to meet with one of the key players in India's transition, the great leader Mahatma Gandhi. It would be one of Gandhi's final meetings before the leader's assassination at the hands of a Hindu nationalist on January 30. The resulting photos of Gandhi's last day of life and the events surrounding his funeral helped catapult Cartier-Bresson to international fame. The country's culture and people inspired the photographer to go back six more times over the next few decades. What he captured in India are among some of his most inspiring works.",
