    "introduction": "Ignác Martinovics (1755-95) was a curious figure in Hungarian history: a member of the Franciscan order, ordained priest, academic in natural sciences, as well as a revolutionary, secret agent, agitator and organiser. During the reign of Emperor Leopold II, a true child of the Enlightenment, he worked for the State to further the cause of progressive change; while during the reign of his successor, Francis II, he was involved in secret activities aimed at protecting those reforms. By 1794, Martinovics found himself caught in a web of too many schemes and secret societies – ending in his arrest, trial and execution as an enemy of the crown.For this austere, clear and sharp telefeature, Judit Elek focused on the last months of Martinovics’ life: his interrogation by the Austrians, the examining Magistrate Schilling in particular, shown as a battle of wits as well as delusions – on both sides. Elek had wanted to make this film in the early 1970s, but wasn’t allowed to. When she finally got the chance, the reactions were predictable, as the parallels with recent Hungarian history were simply too obvious for officialdom not to feel anxious. History may not repeat itself, but the variations look eerily similar...源自：https://iffr.com/en/iffr/2023/films/the-trial-of-martinovics-and-the-hungarian-jacobins",
