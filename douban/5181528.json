    "introduction": "Okay, I'll admit it, I like vampire movies..and Abe's Tomb was no exception. The girls in the movie are quite lovely but for me, being a woman, that wasn't the draw (but for any red-blooded male, it will be), for me, it was the depth of the characters and the storyline, itself. Mr. Merritt's first movie shows his skill as a published author (Fleet of Angels) and translates very well into the theatre. The unexpected twists and macabre turns will keep you guessing as to what will come next. If you like a movie that sticks with you after the credits have rolled, this is the one for you. I hear that Abe's Tomb II is currently in the works and will definitely buy it when it is released. Great job, Carl and team! - Amazon Review",
