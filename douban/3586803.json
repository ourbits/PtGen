    "introduction": "http://www.kinoeye.org/02/03/trajkov03.phpPolitics issues dominate this sci-fi story set in 2041 in the former Yugoslavia. Most of Europe is now controlled by \"thought police,\" but a former politician and an ex-cop are running a girls' boarding school in defiance of the current regime, modeled on the more idyllic 1980s. These partners want to revamp the ruins of Belgrade so electricity and water can be restored and the buildings made habitable again. The citizens are currently scattered across the countryside, and the film follows them, as well as the boarding school directors and a female reporter, as they all work together to confront the system.Belgrade in 2041. is a deserted and ruined town full of garbage. A few old men live in it: ex-reporter and his daughter, ex-politician and his wife, and ex-policeman who guards boarding school with eight girls. Old men are raising girls in the spirit of former Yugoslav people tradition, which is a risky job, because southern Europe is haunted by a gang which does not allow any recollections of the past. The story begins in the moment when ex-reporter starts the action for revitalization of Belgrade, wanting to celebrate 100 years of the revolution.Zilnik is still employing the creative and provactive style that brought him to prominence in the late 1960s. Zilnik is the director that in 1969 beat Midnight Cowboy in Berlin with his first feature film, Rani radovi (Early Works, 1969) and won the Golden Bear. Attacked many times by the grey eminences of the establishment, he remained faithful to his own creative poetry and continued to be very productive, despite the historical changes that occured around him.He was once very popular among Yugoslav liberal audience and directed hits such as Lijepe zene prolaze kroz grad (Pretty Women Walking Through the City, 1985) or Tako se kalio celik (How Steel Was Tempered, 1988). He caught the eye of the critics with his very provocative Dupe od mramora (Marble Ass, 1995) and Kud plovi ovaj brod (Wanderlust, 1998), while films such as Bruklin-Gusinje (Brooklyn-Gusinje, 1988) were an exercise in style. He also made many excellent documentaries and short films, among which are Sedam madarskih balada (Seven Hungarian Ballads, 1978) and Tvrdava Evropa (Fortress Europe, 2000).",
