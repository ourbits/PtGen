    "introduction": "Politician, officer and leader - Winston Churchill served as the Prime Minister of Great Britain in arguably some of the most trying times of modern history. After Chamberlain's resignation in 1940, Churchill was appointed during World War II and ultimately lead the country along the road to victory. On the same day, Winston Churchill became prime minister on 10 May 1940, German forces poured into Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and France. The first few months of his premiership allowed Churchill to display many of the qualities that singled him out as an infamous leader. His force of personality was instrumental in cementing the 'Big Three' Alliance with Britain's powerful allies, Russia and the United States. His memorable speeches strengthened Britain's resolve during the darkest days. Through a combination of luck, defiance and an ability to inspire others, he has gained a global reputation as one of the greatest war leaders of all time.",
