    "introduction": "Four salesmen Alan, Ian, Steve and Tim are on their way to a conference where only one of them is guaranteed promotion. There is much bickering, Steve is perpetually sick and gets put in the boot, the C.D. player jams and they have a run-in with a Range Rover driver. When the car breaks down in a snow storm they wind up in a deserted cottage with a shotgun-wielding, diabetic woman. But help is at hand in the form of an unusual guardian angel who not only mends their car but their confidence. Written by don @ minifie-1",
