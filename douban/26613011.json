With a landfill nearby, Susaek reeks of the trucks bringing the city’s garbage. When Korea is chosen to hold the 2002 World Cup, Susaek is mentioned as the location for the new soccer stadium. Greedy entrepreneurs crowd into town and the locals get excited, hoping for urban renewal and redevelopment. When Won-seon is recruited by a local gang and gets involved in the redevelopment business, Sang-woo becomes jealous. Can their friendship survive the new strains?",
