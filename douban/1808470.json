    "introduction": "Convoy Busters may not be the best Polizi movie ever to come out of Italy, but it's certainly an above average crime romp with a great cast and more action packed stunt sequences than you can shake a stick at! The film is set up a little differently to most of the Polizi movies that I've seen, as it's a movie of two halves and a lot of it takes place in settings unlike the thick urban atmosphere I've come to associate with this sort of movie; namely, a quiet seaside town and the rural countryside. Most of these films take influence from Dirty Harry, and Convoy Buster is no different as Maurizio Merli's maverick copper has a definite Clint Eastwood vibe about him; but the fact that it's a little different gives Convoy Busters a lot of credibility in my opinion. The story starts when the dead body of a young girl is found with her throat cut. Commissioner Olmi takes the case, but when his violent methods leave an innocent man dead; he gets transferred to a quiet coastal town. However, the fact that it's quiet doesn't mean there isn't any organised crime...",
