    "introduction": "Wild Canada From the filmmakers of the acclaimed series Human Planet and Planet Earth comes Wild Canada, this spectacular five-part series on the wildlife and the wild lands of Canada reveals a Canada that few have seen before. Underlying the series is an epic narrative through time and across the vast scale of the Canadian landscape, that provides exciting new stories about the plant and wildlife of Canada. New research reveals that many of Canada's unique and stunning natural landscapes are the direct result of ancient human activity. Each episode tells two parallel stories: the natural history of Canada, and how past humans shaped Canada's landscape and the wildlife spectacles we see today.",
