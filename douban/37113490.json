    "introduction": "The Serling documentary will explore how Serling’s writing helped change television forever. The film will look at Serling’s humble beginnings in television and how he later used his platform to affect change both on and off the screen, including his battles with censors and how he grappled with thought provoking issues of racism, war, the dangers of technology, and morality via the genre-bending, sci-fi parables.But the Serling film will also be told in “his own words,” leaning on archival footage — provided by his estate — to have his own voice helping to guide the story. You can’t have a Serling documentary that the late writer doesn’t in some way narrate himself. What’s more, the film will also have re-enactments of moments of his life shot in black and white in the style of “The Twilight Zone.”",
