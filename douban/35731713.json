    "introduction": "In 1987, during the writing process of Quatre aventures de Reinette et Mirabelle, Nouvelle Vague master Éric Rohmer decided to leave out the fifth episode of the film and develop it into a theatre play instead. Inspired by the famous Mozart piece, he called it \"Le Trio en mi bémol\", and it went on to premiere at the end of that year at the Théâtre Renaud-Barrault under his direction. 35 years later, Portuguese filmmaker Rita Azevedo Gomes has now taken on the play and made it her own with the help and complicity of some dear friends. Conceived by Rohmer as a \"comédie brève en sept tableaux\", Azevedo Gomes respects the main structure, a series of encounters between two ex-lovers who still are very fond of each other. But in her version, Paul (Pierre Léon) and Adélia (Rita Durão) extensively discuss love, passion and tenderness for the camera of a film director (legendary Spanish filmmaker Adolfo Arrieta), who teases the actors at his whim. With her usual keen eye for beauty and elegance, Azevedo Gomes draws the best not only from her actors but also from the set, a beautiful sixties modernist beach house on the coast of the Minho region.",
