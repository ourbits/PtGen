    "introduction": "Over the past 50 years, and despite its relatively small population of only 11 million, Cuba has produced more Olympic boxing medalists than any other country, winning 73 medals in the sport in that time, 38 of them gold. That success was spearheaded by Teófilo Stevenson, who once famously turned down a million-dollar offer to fight Muhammad Ali and turn professional, choosing instead to continue fighting for his beloved homeland. Also at the forefront were Savón and the man behind their greatest achievements, legendary coach Alcides Sagarra Carón. Filmed in Havana and the United States, The People's Fighters features contributions from Savón, Sagarra and the USA's former world champion and Olympic gold medalist Oscar De La Hoya.",
