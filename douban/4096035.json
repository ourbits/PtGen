He hopes to wind up in the U.S. Instead, he finds himself in Berlin doing low-skill, under-the-counter work, earning his living by hustling jobs and changing hard currency (more or less Director Klier’s own fate). There, he runs into a woman he's met before, who is attempting the same transition - only her low-skill work is prostitution. The two live marginally, keeping fragmented, disjointed contact with each other.",
