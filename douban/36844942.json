    "introduction": "A city is celebrating its birthday. The cinematic collage shows snapshots of a metropolis that can draw on the wealth of a rich and diverse cultural life. Experiences and impressions of a jubilee year with many highlights among others the visit of well-known politicians and artists, the Tour de France, the Gymnastics Festival, inauguration of the Chamber Music Hall of the Philharmonic. The eastern part of the city is also shown with its celebrations. Original quotations from various political personalities repeatedly emphasize the unity of Berlin and not the division. The legendary statement of former US President Ronald Reagan in front of the Brandenburg Gate: \"Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!\". The film ends with excerpts of the birthday show and musical journey through the history of the city at the foot of the Victory Column.",
