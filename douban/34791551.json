    "introduction": "Dan Bell films on location in Baltimore, MD's Leakin Park, often referred to by locals as Baltimore's Open Air Cemetery. Documenting the brutal murder of Baltimore resident Vashan Kamal Conyers, this haunting film takes a close look at the murder scene and investigates some possible further clues to this unsolved crime. Rick Serra makes a brief appearance with Dan at the scene to provide additional investigatory on-scene help and discovers a further disturbing find. With Matt Sonswa and Eric Harmin as further film crew lending a hand, this is a thorough and gripping examination of a still active murder investigation.",
