    "introduction": "This is a very effective and compelling short that looks a perception, in this case perception through the eyes of children. Using very basic and deceptively simple hand-drawn animation (incorporating some very entertaining visual tricks along the way) this tells, in effect, two stories: the story the children see and the probable reality the audience may well ascertain from the same \"facts\". A bit like Rashomon, but with only one recounting onscreen. Deservedly won a BAFTA, if I recall correctly. Well worth tracking down. Most recommended.",
