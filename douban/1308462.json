    "introduction": "In a small village in Eastern Hungary, Jóska is on his way home from the pub. Behind Jóska's back, Mari, his spinster sister, sends love-letters in his name to Yelizaveta, the daughter of an Ukrainian family they know.

When Jóska comes home, he pulls the ladder from underneath his pregnant wife. A daughter, Anyochka, is born. Jóska's sister tries to make the baby her own. Yelizaveta works even longer hours, but noone seems to be satisfied with her. Jóska drinks excessively and has jealous fits, not even letting his wife go to the shop alone. Yelizaveta can't stand it any longer. She can't walk back to Ukraine with her daughter, since the little girl does not have a passport...",
