With the Linggo ng Wika Sportsfest playing host to the biggest Patintero stage there is, Meng assembles an unlikely team of fellow losers to try and turn things around: Nicay, her over studious best friend, Shifty, the weird but well-meaning new kid, and the enigmatic urban vigilante Z-boy. As the team trains, battles and claws its way to the top, they discover there may be more at stake for them than just winning or losing.",
