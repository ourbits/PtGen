As tensions grow over Lia’s bond with the baby, the couple decides to send her back, but Lia instead chooses to return to Georgia. What begins as a simple journey to the Georgian border transforms into a three-day passage where Lia and Ferhat, the husband, confront their fears and redefine their ideas of family and belonging.",
