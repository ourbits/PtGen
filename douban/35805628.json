    "introduction": "Jules Guarneri grew up in Villars, with two adopted siblings, in a chalet haunted by the ghost of his mother who died when he was 20, and where his solitary father still lives; the latter presents him one day with his filmed diary. A cumbersome gift that the “filmographer” uses to make it resonate with his own images, thus forging his own emancipating path towards adulthood.",
