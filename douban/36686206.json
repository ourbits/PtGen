    "introduction": "The film begins with two young doctors on a beach near Rome 2,000 years ago who are waxing philosophical about the future of their profession. They then dive into the Mediterranean Sea to reach a mythical island of the singing gorgons, who could turn them into stone.Cut to Rome in 2020 in full lockdown and that same beach. A TV news report announces that a well-known Italian doctor has died of COVID-19 and a friend and fellow doctor reminisce about things they did together, including swimming to that same mythical island.“Canto Delle Meduse” interweaves four tales tied to the 2020 pandemic. Another one of the four narrative strands involves the funeral of a woman named Valeria who, shortly before dying due to COVID-19, had expressed to her female friends the passionate wish to not be buried in the family tomb with her husband, whom she hated.",
