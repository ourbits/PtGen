    "introduction": "A fairy casts a spell on the farm boy Zaches. From then on, the misshapen boy is regarded by everyone as the most beautiful and clever, while his repulsive nature rubs off on others. This makes it easy for him to win the heart of a beauty and become a minister at the court of the prince who wants to have all fairies banished. E.T.A. Hoffmann (1776 - 1822) wrote the fairy tale as a satire on the Enlightenment, which fights the fairies of poetry, and on a Romanticism that exhausts itself in clichés. The storyline of the television play, in which Hoffmann appears, is intended to dramaturgically emphasize the ironic distance to the world of fairy tales.",
