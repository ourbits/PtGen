    "introduction": "“A muse is always a woman and a lover.”  This vivid adaptation of May Sarton’s 1965 landmark novel tells the story of writer Hilary Stevens, who shocked the world in the 1920s with her novel about a love affair between two women.  In the 1960s, the aging writer is interviewed by two young reporters who want to know, “Who’s the muse?”Through lushly filmed flashbacks, Hilary recalls the women who have inspired her work, revealing not only her own romantic past but also taking us on a historical journey from the sexually liberated 20s to the McCarthy witch hunts of the 50s.  This labor of love, which took writer-director Linda Thornburg over 20 years to bring to the screen, features exceptional acting, intelligent writing, and a diverse and beautiful soundtrack ranging from jazz to opera.“Romantic, smart and exquisite”  --Frameline Film Festival",
