    "introduction": "A documentary directed by Inudo Isshin, known for Josee, the Tiger and the Fish and La Maison de Himiko, The Unnameable Dance shows the life and dance of Tanaka Min, an elderly dancer in his 70s, in a multifaceted and dynamic manner. After accompanying Tanaka Min on his journey to perform 90 dances in five countries for three years from 2017, Inudo Isshin called his dance \"a dance that cannot be defined by genre.\" Anywhere, whether they are alleys, beaches, theaters, bookstores, or galleries, can be his stage, and the energy of those spaces draws out dance from his body—a dance that will not and cannot be repeated. The film captures other aspects of Tanaka Min’s life as a farmer and an actor. Here are the rare moments when a person′s art coincides with his life. Along with his dance, the animated scenes and scenes from the samurai film in which he appeared are also eye-catching. (KANG Sowon)",
