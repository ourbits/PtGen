    "introduction": "Depending on the province, the religion, traditions and languages people can differ a lot. But when it comes to tea Indians are all at one. From north to south, form east to west, everywhere are small tea stalls with their chai wallahs. Every chai wallah follows the same occupation but still they live a totally different life in their state. Through the portraits of our chai wallahs we want to express topics as, contrast of rich and poor, role allocation of women and men, India between boom and tradition, dream and nightmare. The personal story and experience of the chai wallahs show the unique, authentic picture of the Indian society.",
