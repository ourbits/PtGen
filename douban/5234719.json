    "introduction": "Life is treating self-confident and opend-minded Max (Stephen Mangan) very good. As the first born of a wealthy Jewish family he doesn’t need to worry about money. He loves his girl friend and can imagine sharing his life with her. Everything could easily just continue the way it is  if there wouldn’t be the sudden doubts, the diffused emotions of inner emptiness and the urge for a change that Max feels.His father, Simon Breslauer (Jan Decleir) is a self-made man: He is the owner of SUPERTEX – a company leading the dutch cheap clothes market. Despite his bourgeoisen and prosperous life, the old patriarch never forgot where he came from and sticks to the Jewish tradition. His sons have no chance against his dominance. Max, the vital and slightly cynical mid-thirty tries to revolt against the outsized/omnipotent father, wants to get out of his shadow and away from the company. His younger brother Boy (Elliot Levey) is more adjustable to his fathers wishes; gets engaged properly with a JEWISH PRINCESS and contents himself with his role as the bookkeeper of his fathers business.A dramatically accident of the head of the family changes the brothers plans. They have to make new decisions; find their way to themselves and to their very individual luck.",
