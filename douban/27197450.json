This short journey through Rishikesh, Bikaner and Gangtok with the ups and downs, the missed trains and taxi rides, the heartbreak and the mending of old friendships, the quarrels and self-discovery, sweeps Jaya and Yogi away, and indeed us as well, into a very special and unforgettable experience. And do they fall in love? We really hope so.",
