    "introduction": "In 1969, the police raided the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City's Greenwich Village - leading to three nights of rioting by the city's gay community. With this outpouring of courage and unity, the Gay Liberation Movement had begun.Before Stonewall pries open the closet door - setting free the dramatic story of the sometimes horrifying public and private existences experienced by gay and lesbian Americans since the 1920s. Revealing and often humorous, this widely acclaimed film relives the emotionally-charged sparking of today's gay rights movement - from the events that led to the fevered 1969 riots to many other milestones in the brave fight for acceptance.Experience the unforgettable, decade-by-decade history of homosexuality in America through eye-opening historical footage and amazing interviews with those who lived through an often brutal closeted history. You owe it to yourself to see Before Stonewall.",
