    "introduction": "In the household of a wealthy Romanian noblewoman in 1855, Maria, a Roma-Gypsy slave, is fighting to obtain freedom for her son, Dinca. Part of a future full-length project, this short presents a day in the household in which Maria and her son, Dinca, serve as slaves. As important guests arrive for dinner and all the slaves are making preparations, Maria and her son see this day as a chance to take a step that will change their fate. During the times of slavery, up until 1856, the Romanian equivalent of the word \"forgiveness\" was used when referring to freeing someone from slavery (the Roma slave was \"forgiven\" from slavery).",
