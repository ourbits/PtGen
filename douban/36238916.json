    "introduction": "VOY is a documentary film about football, but not the kind we are used to watching on TV or playing in the yard. It is about the football where all the players are totally blind. The film tells the story of the Russian Paralympic Blind Football team which is preparing for the most important event in their lives - the European Championship. The team has only one goal - to win the gold medal at any cost. As they prepare, the head coach and players are faced with significant challenges which put their dream at risk.",
