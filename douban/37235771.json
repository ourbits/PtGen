    "introduction": "Taro Yoshiyama is an indie filmmaker, but not one of the cool ones continuously working and with anecdotes for days like Abel Ferrara but a passive directionless drifter in life (with a fine mop of hair) being supported by his girlfriend, Yuki. When he has the chance to network after a film festival in the hot spring town of Beppu, he ends up hanging out with Miki Sunahara, an actress with an open personality (and often a beer in hand) who is spending her life like a flâneur. As the two ramble along Before Sunrise (1995) style, she begins to bring out Taro’s inner feelings and maybe a little crush…ADACHI Shin’s fourth film was originally planned as a short but evolved into feature taking in the delights of Oita Prefecture. Part travelogue, part self-reflexive comedy, it brims with chill humour found in the easy interplay between a shy SANO Hiroki and the sparkling presence of AMANO Hana as two thoughtful souls wandering around in search of life’s meaning.",
