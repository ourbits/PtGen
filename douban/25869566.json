When Pi goes away to pick kiwifruit, Tania is left by herself to plan for their trip. Stuck in a petrol station - getting security training and making sure her boss, Rog, doesn't lose his job - Tania can't rescue her brother from his new mates and from thinking he can fly. Dean, the regional manager, arrives to keep an eye on Rog but Dean has his eye on Tania, too. When Dean questions Tania's culture and who her family is, she starts to piece together the truth and realises she must save her brother and bring him home. Then one night a cheeky little bird ruins everything and Tania pays the ultimate price for being a hero.",
