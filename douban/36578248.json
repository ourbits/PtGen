    "introduction": "Abby is a pragmatic Los Angeles attorney who is brought, reluctantly, to a wellness retreat up North by her friend Rachel. At the retreat, Abby runs into Sean, her one-time high-school best friend to whom she hasn’t spoken since he was a no-show on her 20 years ago.Despite Rachel’s insistence that she hear Sean out, Abby is reluctant to drudge up high school drama. As Abby tries to make the best of her time there, with the help of forbidden junk food and goat yoga, sparks fly between Rachel and a handsome chef. One afternoon, Abby and Sean become stranded from the group on a beautiful sunset hike and the ice begins to thaw and old feelings reignite. When Abby learns the reasons behind their long ago falling out, she opens her heart to the possibility that this man from her past just might be her future.",
