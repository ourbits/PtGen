    "introduction": "An intriguing story, or rather TWO intriguing stories of couples struggling to justify their relationship. Socas and Prodan are scientists whose mutual physical attraction is jaded by ethical differences. Rheinhold and Calvo are a homosexual couple getting to grips with discrimination. They say Argentina is one of the 'hotbeds' of modern psychiatry and this film sustains the claim, but the oblique dialogues and 'suggested' situations and perspectives remain fresh and surprising to the cerebral viewer. The parallel 'affairs' join up in the abrupt and quirky finale, leaving us, the spectators, with a very REAL sense of loss and surprise... something which movies often tend to 'telegraph' beforehand. A strange film,which may be proposing a new, elliptical approach to storytelling.",
