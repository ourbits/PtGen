    "introduction": "On October 26th, 1979, the nation's dictator is gone but in a small family, an eldest sister gets the absolute power as the next dictator two days later. Her money and power is relegated to the next sister, who wants to seek pleasure of having power. Yet that's not a simple task as starving younger siblings revolt against her authority, threatening to tell mother about her atrocities. Subduing their repulsion with noodles and soda pop, she brags on about her generosity, even being diplomatic about giving excuse to elder sister's outing. Filled with wits and metaphors, this film doesn't just stop at lampooning the images of dictators and descending of power, but goes further to be critical of our tendency to give up a hard fought rights, forgiving all the infamy for a bowl of Chinese noodles.",
