    "introduction": "A group of teenagers rent a house with a sauna for a party. Everybody is having a good time: dancing, singing, drinking, talking. The party ends and everybody leaves, but in the morning the housekeepers come to clean the place and in the dressing room they find a girl who is trying to find a button of her ripped up trousers.DIRECTOR’S STATEMENTIn By the Pool a tragic event is depicted from the perspective of a group rather than concentrating on a single character personal point-of-view, in order to try and understand how one individual’s tragedy gets drown out by the tumult caused by the group as a whole.",
