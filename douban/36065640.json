Arriving at the farm, Annabelle and the kids discover a new creature has taken up residence - a magical unicorn. As the orphans try to determine the mythical beast's purpose, they are doggedly pursued by Bo and Mother Chloris, the cranky headmaster of the orphanage. Also, Natalie, a sympathetic social worker, investigates the orphan's past and discovers a family secret that could change Annabelle's life forever.",
