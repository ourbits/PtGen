    "introduction": "This film is about seeking a hope of multicultural family kids with a broken heart. A violist Yongjae O’Neill who was born to a disable Korean mother and raised in America meets kids who were born to multicultural parents in Korea through the medium of music. And in the Korean society where the myth of a racially homogeneous nation has been dominant, they embrace and share each other’s pains and exchange emotions through music. Seemingly this film overlaps the personal story of Yongjae O’Neill with the story of kids, but the film describes wounded hearts and conditions of the kids through words of Yongjae O’Neill. Therefore, even though they don’t speak out their pains, watching them getting immersed into music is very impressive, and the moment that they eventually take the first step toward the world, the audience will feel the kids’ thrill and tension together, which will be the best moment this film shares with the audience.
