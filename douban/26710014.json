    "introduction": "Businessman Erik Frederiksen pays little attention to his impending wedding with Greta Hansen, although his careerist parents duly mistrust her wild plans to open a bar with 'real coffee' without proper business plan. Real trouble arrives in the person of globetrotting photographer Leon Niemann, who warns his ex Greta they were formally divorced, as she neglected the paperwork, and he's in no hurry to decide if he really wants to, even tests the water for a reconciliation. Leon temporarily moves back into the boat she wants to sell. Her devoted father Erland Hansen is startled to find his estranged hippie wife Tilda, an ever-absent mother, invited herself, encouraged by gentle son Henner to attempt a reconciliation, having most generously forgiven her earlier. As she finds out all that and how poorly she knows the groom, the bride gradually reconsiders future and past, while Leon plays the key part at her hen night, questioned duly by Henner.",
