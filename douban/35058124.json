With commentary from some of the most influential and prolific voices in the culinary world, the film follows a group of sea urchin divers in Santa Barbara as they deal with the hazards of their vocation. A new documentary from the creators of the SOMM films, The Delicacy takes the viewer from the coastal waters of California to the plates of high-end restaurants as it follows one of the most sought after foods in the world gathered by the most dangerous profession.",
