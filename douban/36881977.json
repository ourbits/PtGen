    "introduction": "Undone is a one-channel video work, made up of found footage of bombings: Ukraine by Russia, Palestine and Syria by Israel, Afghanistan and Iraq by the United States. By zooming into and rewinding the footage, Afshar aborts the attacks and deflates the violent consequences of armed conflicts, while the layered soundscape—from an anxious heartbeat to a dying pulse—places humanity in an atmosphere of chaos. Undone imagines the possibility of “undoing” the acts of violence that continue to mark our present moment.",
