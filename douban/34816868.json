    "introduction": "Summer 1943. A young 19-year-old man dressed simply in jeans, T-shirt and a red Fedora arrives in New York with just a few dollars in his pocket. His dream is to become the greatest actor in the world. Eleven years later, after appearing in the films such as A Streetcar Named Desire, The Wild One, and On the Waterfront, he earned the title of the greatest screen actor in history. He not only revolutionized the profession of acting with an impulsive and raw style, never seen before, he also became the icon and a inspiration for an entire generation of youth. This in-depth portrait of Marlon Brando charts his life from his roots as a farm boy from Omaha, Nebraska to his journey to New York and his rise as the greatest actor of his generation. With rare footage and interviews with those who knew him best, Marlon Brando: An Actor Named Desire gives us an intimate glimpse at the life, times and struggles of the man that became the legend that we all know today.",
