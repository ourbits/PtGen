    "introduction": "Director Hala Khalil has a lot to say about Egypt post-Tahrir Square and 122 minutes is hardly enough to fit it all into the absorbing feature Nawara. This is a classic ‘women’s film’ in which life is tough for the determinedly cheerful Cairo maid Nawara (the appealing Menna Shalabi) from the get-go, and clearly risks getting worse. It’s just a question of when.",
