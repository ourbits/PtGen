    "introduction": "What are today’s young people like? Generation Z is growing up in the world that offers them everything that was not available ‘back in the day’ – they were born in the age of prosperity, access to the latest technologies and knowledge. Yet, their emotional condition shows that growing up in the digital era makes life easier but not simpler. Pressure, anxiety and loneliness are everyday experiences of teenagers, who speak with brutal honesty about what it is really like to grow up in the age of social media. In the world in which one can have it all, they are still looking for what is the hardest to come by - understanding and closeness.",
