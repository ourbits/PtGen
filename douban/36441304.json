    "introduction": "Setting: a workshop. When it comes to Thomas Schütte’s larger than life sculptures, the work is hands on – and on an impressive scale. Sanding, sawing and milling are the order of the day. The artist, with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth, moulds the eyes of a figure with his own hands or sometimes uses computer simulation. Regardless of the machinery, technology or material, it becomes clear: art is hard work.",
