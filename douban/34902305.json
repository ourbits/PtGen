    "introduction": "Michel de Montaigne (1533–1592) describes in a part of his essay Apology for Raymond Sebond something which is still current. Nature shows herself equal and fair in her treatment of all living beings and views man as an integral part of nature, then, but also as one composed of the same matter as all other creatures of the universe. By quoting Lucretius, who was himself a disciple of Archelaus' school of materialism, he underscores that all creatures of the universe have an identical fate, one which does not depend on man's ability to reason. Men is no different from the animals by demonstrating that animals approach humans and at times surpass them in their characteristics and behavior. If he still thinks that he is superior, then all the present deseases of civilization will follow: sickness, irresolution, affliction and despair.",
