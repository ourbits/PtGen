    "introduction": "Helmer of one of Argentina’s most remarkable filmographies, Fernando “Pino” Solanas ends his career with a documentary in which he explores the mysteries of creation alongside two other great artists who are in the final stages of their lives: actor and playwright Eduardo “Tato” Pavlovsky and visual artist Luis Felipe Noé. Talking about issues such as exile, political commitment, crises and desire, they share experiences and reflect on the origin of their ideas and the material exercise of creativity. As a closure that overflows with vitality and also looks at death right in the eye, Tres a la deriva del acto creativo is not just the end of a brilliant career, but also a true testament that reaffirms constant restlessness and curiosity as inalienable qualities for all those who want to devote their life to art.",
