    "introduction": "\"Piazza Garibaldi\" is a name found in almost any Italian town. It is a metaphor for the nation and its history. Like in the successful, award-winning \"La strada di Levi\", Ferrario sets off on a journey: this time, on the traces of the expedition of the Thousand. The aim: to verify the relationship between past and present, starting from Bergamo, formerly the \"City of the Thousand\" and today a bastion of Padania, and arriving at Teano. The voyage is full of surprises, meetings, reflections: a sweeping road movie through the history and geography of the country, seeking to answer a nagging question: why are Italians no longer able to imagine a future for themselves?",
