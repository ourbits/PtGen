    "introduction": "Adaptation of controversial real-life story from the 1950s.In 1953, five young men crossed the border from Czechoslovakia to East Germ any. They went to deliver a secret message from a Czechoslovak general to the US authorities, and they planned to join the US Army Special Forces in order to return and liberate Czechoslovakia. The three-day operation turned into “the largest manhunt of the Cold War” as thousands of East German and Soviet troops pursued the group for 31 days through thick and thin. Milan Paumer, Josef and Ctirad Mašín eventually made their way to West Berlin. And there, they created an anti-communist resistance group inspired by a World War II resistance leader, Czech general Josef Mašín, the brothers’ father. However, the siblings’ heroic legacy has been tainted by the group’s killings of six people. Czech public opinion is therefore divided over their status, with some regarding them as heroes and others as villains.导演是人物原型的远亲。",
