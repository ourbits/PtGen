Eventually, a respected family from Kolkata agree to an alliance, but upon one strange condition: the would-be bride should know how to knit a sweater. Tuku is sent to a relative's house to learn knitting, but here, she undergoes a transformation courtesy of the interesting friends she makes and Shammo, the impressionist she falls in love with. Will a reformed Tuku be confident enough to stand up for herself",
