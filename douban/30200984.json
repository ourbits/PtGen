Mert Turker at an interesting point in terms of location, notices the various oddities of the patients, the patients and the working people. However, in the first days everything is going on in normal course. His first patient becomes Esat Bey and realizes that he has interesting behaviors he has not seen in other patients. As Mert struggles to communicate with this patient, a young patient named Elif comes to the hospital. The first diagnosis of Elif is a hysterical psychosis, but the patient begins to claim that he is haunted by an entity during therapies. Although Mert initially argues that such an event is not scientifically feasible, it will eventually find itself in an unexpected state.",
