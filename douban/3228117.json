    "introduction": "The subject of this film was raised to live in an ideal society that was destined never to come into being. His left-leaning parents lived in the FRG but dreamed of living under socialism. A trip to the GDR soon shattered the myths and dispelled their illusions. A wry but tender look back at growing up during the heady years of the 1960s and ‘70s and the illogicality of life in both Germanys.",
