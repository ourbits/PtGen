    "introduction": "Rianne Angers has spent the last nine years obsessing over the vicious murder of Gwen Anderson. And it is understandable: Her brother Nick went to prison for the crime. Now that Nick is back, he needs her help to find who really killed the always smiling and happy Gwen. But Rianne is not thrilled with Nick's return: She has bloomed without her overbearing and charismatic brother and she is not willing to give that up. About to finish school and take the next step in her relationship, Rianne realizes she has too much to lose with her older brother pulling her back into the past.",
