    "introduction": "艾迪（J.D. Pardo飾）自小就隱約的感受自己的性別有些不同，他喜歡穿著母親的女裝與化妝用品，隨著青春期的來臨，他更感受到自己的特質，在男孩的身體裡住著一個女孩的靈魂。經歷了沈重的掙扎後，艾迪向母親傾訴想轉性的意願，並意外的得到母親的支持，十七歲的他改名為關，開始了身為女性的日子，然而隨之而來的是社會的不認同，最後關遭到三名少年虐殺活埋，這件悲慘的事件至今仍讓美國社會難忘，在這場漫長的訴訟中，她的冤屈將會得到洗刷嗎？Based on a true story. As a young boy, Eddie Araujo always felt different somehow. She started putting on her mom's makeup and wearing her mom's clothes, which her mom found odd. By the time she entered her teen years, Eddie could no longer hide the fact that she was a lot different, that she was meant to be female and not male. When she finally accepted it and with her mom's eventual support, Eddie changed her name to Gwen and started to live life as female until a tragic night changed everything. Written by r2k443In this movie, Gwen Araujo was born Eddie Araujo. But as she got older she started seeing that she was more of a female then a male. So she changed her name to Gwen when she was in high school and she was no longer a male. When she was 17 years old she was killed by 3 teenage boys after they discovered she was a male. They beat her for 5 hours before tying her up and throwing her in a grave. Two of the boys were convicted of second-degree murder, and one boy plead out to manslaughter. The judge and jury did not see this as a hate crime and none of the boys were convicted of one. Written by caitlin c",
