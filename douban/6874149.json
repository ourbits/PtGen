    "introduction": "Over the course of a balmy east coast summer, an introverted, bespectacled teenager is brought into the strange and delightful world of his bohemian neighbors. What unfolds, against the backdrop of lush flowerbeds and overgrown vegetable patches, is a mirthful story of unlikely and rekindled friendships. But for all of its wine-soaked, pot-infused dreaminess, Breakfast is firmly rooted in reality. The rambling purple house where the action happens is writer/director/co-star Laura Colella's, and her captivating cast is composed of her very own housemates and neighbors. Despite the homespun approach and unfettered narrative, Colella's tale has a distinct vision and clear intention, one joyously devoted to the pleasure principle.",
