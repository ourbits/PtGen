    "introduction": "Sad Sarah, the harpist of the Jerusalem Philharmonic, is married to Abraham the conductor of the orchestra. They have no children. When Hagar, a young horn-player from East Jerusalem joins the Western side Orchestra, Sarah's world changes... Harmonia is inspired by the biblical story from the book of Genesis, giving a feminine interpretation to the story of the \"mothers\" and their two half brother boys. By that, challenging the metaphoric origin of the historic clash between the two conflicted peoples, now seeking harmony through the world of classical music.",
