    "introduction": "The wars that have raged in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the past decade and a half have had horrific consequences for the nation's youth. A variety of organizations are putting into action their faith in the regenerative power of sports, music, dance, and the arts. Yole! Africa provides a space where young people can draw, play music, dance, and play the drums. The Association for the Support of the Oppressed organizes games, music, and theater activities for groups of children. And Promo Jeunes Basket helps instill values of respect and sincerity through playing basketball. This short film takes a brief look into the how these small, grassroots efforts are helping young people recover from the effects of a brutal civil war.",
