    "introduction": "Model, film star, muse, socialite, icon. Edie Sedgwick was the very first \"it\" girl of the Andy Warhol Factory scene. The arc of her life traced the rise and fall of the 1960s recklessness. After being the toasted by the whole of New York City, Edie died alone of a drug overdose in California at the age of 28. She was both the harbinger of celebrity culture and someone who stood entirely outside of it, an artist who painted life, bravely and spontaneously, with her own hand.",
