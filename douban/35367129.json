In an effort to teach Sam a lesson, her dad transfers her to a public school. Stripped of all privileges, Sam tries to prove to her dad that she can survive one whole year in this new environment. Then comes Jake, the less-privileged ladies' man from this new school. As Jake helps Sam adjust to the challenging life in Quiapo, the unlikely pair eventually finds love in this wild little world.",
