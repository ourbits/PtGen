    "introduction": "What do young people think about showering at school after gym class? Experiences from the same changing room can be very different. Some shower naked, some shower with underwear on, while others spray on a little extra perfume and hope for the best. Stories from the Shower is a short documentary that examines adolescents' experiences in school showers and changing rooms as told by themselves. Together, their stories create a picture of a complex time, where the changing room becomes an epicenter for young people's joys and challenges.",
