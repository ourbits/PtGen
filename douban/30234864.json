    "introduction": "The official documentary of the band DEVO. This new film takes you into the brains that created the concept, the music, and the spectacle of Devo. Devo the band was more than the highly stylized visual band of the New-wave era and early MTV. They were in fact a lot deeper, more subversive, and political than people realized. Through exclusive interviews and rare archival footage this documentary offers not only a funny and fascinating retrospective story but sheds light on the inner workings and meaning of one of America's most important, influential and misunderstood bands, DEVO.",
