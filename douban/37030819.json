He has suffered from hearing loss since the age of one, and without a hearing aid he cannot even hear the sound of an airplane passing overhead. Making a sound-sensitive stringed instrument requires extraordinary effort, and Dong-joon's family is worried and concerned about his decision to pursue a career as a musical instrument maker. Meanwhile, Dong-joon prepares to enter an international violin-making competition in Mittenwald, Germany to prove his skills.",
