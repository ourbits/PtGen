    "introduction": "A commercial actor takes on a job teaching Shakespeare to pay the bills and ends up finding his leading lady in “Reading, Writing & Romance,” a Hallmark Channel Original Movie World Premiere Saturday, August 10 (9p.m. ET/PT, 8C). Eric Mabius (“Ugly Betty”) and Virginia Williams (“Fairly Legal”) star alongside five-time Golden Globe(R) and two-time Emmy(R) nominee Stefanie Powers (“Hart to Hart”), three-time Emmy(R) nominee Meredith Baxter (“Family Ties”), Martin Mull (“Two and A Half Men”) and Adam Kulbersh (“Wake Up, It’s Tuesday!”) in this lighthearted romantic comedy. Struggling actor Wayne Wenders (Mabius) is comically famous for starring in a low-budget commercial for Irritable Bowel Syndrome medication, a reputation he is hoping to change when he finally lands a starring role in a national root beer ad. But when the paycheck for his big break is delayed, Wayne looks for other options to pay his increasingly late rent and ends up interviewing for a gig teaching Shakespeare at the local high school. Principal Brenda Post (Powers) hires Wayne for his natural theatrical talent and enthusiasm, but Wayne is soon surprising himself with his love of the job – and for fellow English teacher Amy (Williams), an attractive woman, who is immediately impressed with Wayne’s passion and his idea to teach the students with an exciting film project.",
