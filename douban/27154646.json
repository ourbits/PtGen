In an attempt to conceal her separation, Alice forces her EX to put on a united front for appearance sake. Tension weaves itself in and out of each interaction, each look, every exchange of words, a constant reminder of the truth Alice so desperately wants to conceal.  This web of deceit entangles these three characters deeper and more tightly as the night progresses.",
