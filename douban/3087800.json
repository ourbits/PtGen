    "introduction": "Belinda Tyler (Scout Taylor-Compton) wants to be a doctor, but women were not usually permitted careers, especially one in the medical field. But Belinda deeply wants a career as a doctor, and feels God has called her to be one. She learns to show her abilities while helping out a local doctor and caring for Mrs. Stafford-Smith (Nancy Linehan Charles),an elderly woman who recently had a stroke. Belinda nurses her back to health and helps her regain the use of her right arm. Belinda meets the nephew of their deceased neighbor, Drew Simpson. Drew (Patrick Levis) comes to town to get his uncle's farm in shape to sell and then return to New York to join his father's law practice. He does not want to stay in this small, unsophisticated town. But after meeting Belinda, he has second thoughts about staying. Belinda also feels something for Drew, but she is conflicted because she wants to become a doctor and then move back home so her loved ones can still get medical care from her. Even though most women of the time only married and had children, Belinda wants more. She has a calling and a great mind for medicine. Determined that it won't work between her and Drew, Belinda plans to leave to study medicine in Boston, with financial help from Mrs. Stafford-Smith. But after hearing Belinda's grandfather share how he felt about his wife, Marty, and how he knew of his feelings for her, does Drew realize he can't live without Belinda. Just as Belinda boards the stage coach, Drew arrives telling her he loves her, is willing to practice law in Boston while she is in school, and wants to move back to this small town with her once she becomes a doctor if that's what she wants. He asks for her to marry him. Knowing she feels the same way for him, Belinda accepts and finally admits to Drew that she loves him too. She and Drew are married with her family and friends present before they move to Boston together",
