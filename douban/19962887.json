    "introduction": "Racketeers, led by Moran, set up what they call the Creamery Betterment Association. They quietly coerce dairy producers to join the association, which will control the dairy market by raising milk by three cents per bottle, one cent of which will go to the association. Moran's ultimate goal is for all three cents to go to the association. Those dairy producers who refuse to join are more forcefully coerced until they feel they have no other option but to join. The higher price of milk has a profound affect on consumers, some who can no longer afford this important product. One dairy producer who holds out of the association is Paige Creamery until Moran's gang threatens Paige's family. The police feel powerless to act until they have more concrete evidence. They convince Paige to continue to hold out so they can use his company as a front for their sting operation of Moran and his gang.",
