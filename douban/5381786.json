    "introduction": "This 16mm Abstract Movie by the Ed Emshwiller is a masterful piece of Pure Cinema. It's wonderfully conceived, beautifully shot, tightly and lovingly edited and put together with a poignant gentle musical score. The optic/in-camera mechanical celluloid visual effects are emotionally Cinematic. This is a visual tone poem, a romantic poetic Love Letter to the movie maker's wife, Carol Emshwiller. The visual textures of the tree barks and the leaves on the branches being gently blown in the wind being double-exposed with the visual texture of Carol's facial skin is sensually pleasurable and expressive. The movie's pacing from a gentle slow rhythm to a kinetic and kinesthetic visual cascade of flashing and flickering colors and explosive motion and bright lights contrasting with dark shadows and shapes in super fast alternating spirals and bursts is exhilarating visceral emotionally intense cinema.",
