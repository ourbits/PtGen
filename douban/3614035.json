    "introduction": "DRANCY AVENIR offers three compelling stories beginning with the last Holocaust survivor, who laments not leaving behind an account of the past he witnessed. In the second tale, a young historian doing research on the concentration camp that operated in Drancy discovers that the site of the camp is now occupied by a low-cost housing project called La Muette (the Silent). In the final tale, a ship's captain recounts a journey up an uncharted river towards a little-known civilization.The mark left by the Holocaust on France is the subject of this triptych of stories from director Arnaud des Pallieres.",
