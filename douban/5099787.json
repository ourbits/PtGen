    "introduction": "The 1960's counter culture limped into the 1970s dragging with it a legacy of social confusion, dependency on drugs and promiscuity. In STAGE FRIGHT, shot in Baltimore, the era is satirized in a story of a store-front theatre and its company of diverse, rootless characters. Everyone in this intriguing dark comedy shares a mutual dread of life. Sold a bill of goods in the 60s, they now have Stage Fright.",
