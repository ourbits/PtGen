He's inherited his unknown father's gorgeous beachfront house and club in the Caribbean island of Nevis, West Indies, and he wants her and the old crew to join him for a week while he absorbs this news. In love with the island, and thrilled to be back together again like the good old days, they unanimously decide to stay for year-one year off to reset their lives. Working together, they host gorgeous beach weddings: the first, beginner's luck, the next a dismal failure. Suddenly, there's trouble in paradise. Can magical Nevis transform them and help old wounds heal and love blossom under the sun in this heartfelt comedy?",
