    "introduction": "Following on from The Larkins’ series finale in mid-November, the entire family will be back on our screens over the festive season for a feature-length special. The story sees Mariette and Charley return to Kent for Christmas, the latter bringing his parents with him for a formal introduction.However, things quickly go wrong when a power cut leaves the entire village without lighting or heating, which is particularly bad timing when residents have been suffering a recent spate of burglaries. The synopsis teases that “chaos descends on the Larkins’ farm”.It’s not all bad news though, as people are eagerly anticipating the premiere of a local pantomime, while love is also in the air as Mariette and Charley prepare to “take their love to the next level”.",
