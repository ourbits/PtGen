A strange gentleman appears in front of the both of them who are sick of failing at these auditions and suggests something to them. Meanwhile, Ayaka comes to Korea with her best friend Saori to meet her fiancé, Min-joon's parents. She runs into Dong-hyeon and Yong-joon who ask her to star in something and although she's not up for it, she's ushered into doing it by Shiori who loves handsome men. They move locations to a run-down facility and suddenly all exits are blocked and the four of them are trapped. Ayaka looks for an exit but instead finds cameras put up everywhere and gets the feeling that they are being watched. She suspects Yong-joon and Dong-hyeon of being behind this.
