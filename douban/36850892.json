    "introduction": "It is not enough to see or hear something once, there is always the need for repetition. Aside from maintaining a detailed diary, I continually document fragments of everyday life with my camera. The images I record never satisfy lived experience, they are simply marks that are barely able to prevent memory from completely vanishing. I never anticipate what images I’ll be able to capture. I only save them as a sign that something was there, or that I was there. “Recollection” is a troubling thing. What is filmed fails to supplement memory. Recorded images are left to haunt the mind, rendering true recollection impossible. In spite of this, I can’t help but rely on these images derived from reality, observing them over and over again. Perhaps, waiting for them to fulfill a potential some 60 years from now. Even if the image is a corpse, the work itself is a living thing. For in the end, there is always the need for repetition.",
