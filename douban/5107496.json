    "introduction": "In the summer of 1947, in a mountain village, a former gendarme captain and legionnaire, hidden in the mountains, terrorizes an entire village.The action takes place when Visarion Olteanu, a former captain of the Gendarmerie, upset by many injustices that have been brought to him over time, begins to terrorize the population of a quiet and secluded village in the Carpathian Mountains. And in order for the cutlery to be complete, it does not work on its own, with the help of a priest from the religious sect \"Jehovah's Witnesses.\" Of course, the two did not do these things just for fun, especially the priest, who through these fears wanted to make the world go away so that he could regain possession of forests that had been nationalized at the time. Did the two of them have a chance to win this battle with an entire village?",
