    "introduction": "Sacris Pulso departs from the dismemberment of another film, “Brasiliários” (Sérgio Basi, Zuleika Porto, 1985), a filmic adaptation of Clarice Lispector’s chronic “Brasília”, a visionary text that looks at the inaugurated capital as a ruin of the future. Through the assemblage of “Brasiliários” with a body of 8mm found footage depicting rituals of travel and family life in Australia (where Ana was studying film), “Sacris Pulso” takes the form of a voyage of memory and fiction, of past and future time calling upon the spectral ghost of Brasília sewed through the ties of a family fiction.",
