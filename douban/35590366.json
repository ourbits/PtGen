    "introduction": "The right to happiness is a tender and profound story at the same time. It is the story of a friendship between different generations, different nationalities, different life experiences. Libero is a passionate used books seller and Essien is an immigrant boy who has been living in Italy for a few years. The friendship between the two passes through the books that Libero lends to Essien and the complicity between them grows parallel to the emotions that each of these novels can give. Essien meets the West through its literature, Libero fulfills the meaning of his name by trying to make Essien a free man. Life, with his commandments, will bring a melancholy ending, but nothing is lost where there is complicity and affection.",
