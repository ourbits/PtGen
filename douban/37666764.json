    "introduction": "Shot in inner Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, in a landscape transformed by the monoculture of mostly transgenic soy, maize, and sugar cane, the film follows the process of transforming soy crops into biodiesel, from the moment of harvest to the workflow of one of the main biodiesel processing factories in the region. A series of notes and reflections taken by the author are overlaid on the moving images. They ask: What kind of life lies in transgenic seeds? And what does it mean to live with the enemy?",
