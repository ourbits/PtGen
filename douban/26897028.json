    "introduction": "Khoomei or Tuvan throat singing is an ancient vocal tradition originating in the remote Republic of Tuva, which is located in the center of Asia in Siberia, and now, part of the Russian Federation. Considered to predate modern linguistics, Khoomei, involves a remarkable technique for singing two or more pitches simultaneously. The sounds are said to come form the land and harmonize with nature itself. The Alash Ensemble are masters of this vocal art and have been touring the world, sharing their music with other cultures, for years.Shodekeh, a beatboxer and vocal percussionist from Baltimore, with a vision for creating an 'oasis of unity through musical collaboration,' has spent his life mastering new sounds and using them, while fostering seemingly unlikely collaborations. SHU-DE! is the story of what happened when these artists came together, utilizing their common instrument: the voice and the body.SHU-DE! (Tuvan for \"giddy-up\" or \"let's go\") is a sensory experience of music and landscape that takes the viewer on a journey through the vastness of Tuva and that of the human voice, revealing the sounds that unfold with collaboration.",
