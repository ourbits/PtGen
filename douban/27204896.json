    "introduction": "89 tells the incredible story of one of football's greatest triumphs: when against all odds Arsenal snatched the Championship title from Liverpool at Anfield in the last minute of the last game of the 1988/89 season. It's a universal tale of a band of brothers who, led by a charismatic and deeply respected manager, came together to defy the odds and create history. Mixing archive and previously unseen footage with revealing interviews, insights and memories from the original squad, game officials, famous fans and the people who were there on the night this is the definitive account of a watershed moment in football and a must-watch for any sports fan.",
