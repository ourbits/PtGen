    "introduction": "Warbringers - JainaJaina Proudmoore has made many difficult decisions, but no choice weighs more heavily upon her than the decision to step aside when her father fought the Horde years ago. She believed then that he was consumed by irrational hatred. But now . . . she wonders if she should have listened. A new war between the Alliance and the Horde rages across Azeroth. This time, Jaina will not stand aside.Warbringers - SylvanasSylvanas Windrunner, warchief of the Horde, leads her forces to victory against the night elves of Darnassus and moves to conquer their home: the World Tree, Teldrassil. But a chance encounter with a dying young Sentinel who questions her motives and tells her that she cannot win the war she is truly fighting—a war on life itself—leads Sylvanas to make a decision that will change the course of history on Azeroth.Warbringers - AzsharaTen thousand years ago, the lands of Azeroth were torn apart by the Sundering. As the continents cracked open and the ocean rushed in, the Highborne elves and their great queen, Azshara, seemed doomed to a watery grave. But what she found in the deep was not oblivion . . . but opportunity.",
