    "introduction": "A family longs to be on a TV show which does an in-depth expose of a different real-life family every week. When they are finally selected they decide to change their lives completely so that the audience sees them as they want to be seen, not as they really are. This a small peruvian film and one can see that just by checking out the locations. However it works perfect, as it reflects the experiences of a low class family who have the ambition of appearing in a tv show as the family of the week. The acting is adequate and even though many of the jokes might only be enjoyed by peruvians, it still beats any stupid Adam Sandler movie.This Peruvian comedy takes a poke at Latin living and at the power of the media. The story centers around the troubled family of Carmen Huambachano, who never miss Lima's popular weekly TV series \"We Are All Stars.\" In this show, a typical family is first interviewed and then given the opportunity to win prizes. The Huambachano family is chosen, a TV crew is at the door, and now the family must decide how they are going to present themselves on national television. They rally together and quickly begin repainting and redecorating the house, finding their best clothing, and finally looking for a suitable \"husband\" for Carmen. Her real husband, a \"no good rat\" left her years before.",
