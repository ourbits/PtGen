Two partisans, lovers betrayed by an informer, are remembered and re-examined by their daughter many years later; a fugitive saved by two couriers crosses the canals of the Po Delta; Micol Finzi Contini returns to her childhood haunts in Ferrara, the Jewish cemetery, and her house, a ghost who relives in the pages of Giorgio Bassani's novel; and lastly, a fisherman from Pila is caught in his own net of illusions, when he thinks that the loveliest woman in the village, who is married, can no longer resist him.The canals and wetlands, the fog and the plains, Ferrara: holdovers unsullied by time's passing, the backdrop to phantom love stories and desires poised between life and death.",
