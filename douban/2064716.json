    "introduction": "The Doors' Soundstage Performances features live footage from three rare TV appearances during the height of their career from US, Canadian and Danish TV. Material also includes personal commentary and perspectives by band members Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger, John Densmore and manager Danny Sugarman.Culled from three television appearances at the height of the band's career, THE SOUNDSTAGE PERFORMANCES includes 12 songs and extensive interview footage of the band. There are never-before-seen live TV performances from Canada, Europe, and the US, from 1967-'69, including the epic show stoppers \"The End\" and \"When The Music's Over,\" Brecht-Weill's \"Alabama Song (Whiskey Bar),\" and the Willie Dixon blues \"Back Door Man\" among others. Also included is one of Jim Morrison's only on-camera interviews, shot not long after the notorious March 1969 Miami concert where the charismatic front man was arrested for \"lewd and lascivious behavior.\" Additionally, the film includes latter-day exclusive commentary from the surviving Doors. With their genre-colliding sound and boundary-breaking poetic exploration of psychological, sexual, and political frontiers, the Doors are a fascinating gem in the '60s rock crown.The film includes footage from Toronto in 1967, Denmark in 1968, and New York City in 1969.",
