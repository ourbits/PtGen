    "introduction": "In 1933 Eugeniu Botez, an engineer by profession and a commandant of the harbour of Sulina, wrote a novel. He entitled it 'Europolis' and signed it under the name of Jean Bart. A year later he died. In this strange novel Jean Bart prophecies that one day nothing will be left from the town, once full of life. With the death of Europolis Europe will be slowly dying in pains. A few years later his prophecy started to come true.",
