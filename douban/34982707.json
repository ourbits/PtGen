    "introduction": "A campervan is parked in a lay-by in a small town in southern Germany. Two people live in it: a boy and a child. Often they go to eat in a restaurant, but the boy’s behaviour is so strange that the owner became suspicious and decided to film it with the CCTV. The restaurant owner is from South Tyrol and he has heard the child say a few words in Ladin. He tries to talk with the girl to get some information. The child reveals that the boy is not her brother nor even a relative. The couple disappear the next day. The restaurant owner decides to send the film to the police.There is a policewoman in Italy who works with the Post and Communications Police in Rome and among the many horrible things she sees during her hellish days at work in which she has to identify the victims and perpetrators of crimes in on-line material, there is one particular face of a girl she cannot forget, that haunts her. In that video the girl really seems to be asking her for help.Who was watching the girl? Who was behind the camera?What did he look like, what does he look like, what might someone who does something like this look like? This is what the policewoman keeps asking herself.",
