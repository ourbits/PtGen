    "introduction": "THOMAS OUTSIDE is a erotic metaphor of the naked body in communication with nature.In this film the Danish video artist and photographer Thomas / Grundvold uses his mobile phone and a photo camera to make videos that look like old paintings, presenting us his body like it was a piece of clay to mould sculptures from.“Making self portraits has definitely helped my self esteem and helped me love my own body. When I am making nudes of myself I sometimes get sexually aroused, which for years has confused and has made me feel somewhat ashamed, but lately I’ve learned to embrace it. ” Grundvold",
