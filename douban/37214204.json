Athens (Greece) 2019, a part of a generation lost in no man's land, wandering outside of the classroom and the labor market amid a booming sharing economy and expanding gentrification. Five youngsters avoid waiting for an empty future by seeking entertainment in the luxurious Airbnb establishments that one of them is cleaning for a meager fee. On the rooftops they look out over a city in turmoil, daydreaming about a world of possibilities.",
