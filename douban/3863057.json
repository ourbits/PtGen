    "introduction": "While some Italian crime films (particularly post-1977 ones) are just mindless violence (particularly violence against women), many pre-1977 ones are serious commentary on corruption and the justice system in Italy...and by extension to other Western countries. THE BIG FAMILY is such a film. The Mob is in charge at the film's beginning, the Mob is in charge at the film's end. Anyone who challenges it is killed or somehow taken out of the picture. A police inspector or prosecutor who is making progress may suddenly get the offer of a significant promotion...to another part of the country. Every branch of the government...and the church...is compromised. American businessman Richard Conte can come to Sicily hoping to do some construction projects and thinking that his friendship with the Don back in New York will help him here and that he doesn't have to play by the local rules. An honest cop works hard and makes countless sacrifices, and many good people die because he keeps on his quest. Eventually, he nabs the top man...and it turns out he has achieved nothing and he is back at square one. Even the top man is expendable to the overall survival of the big family. I was impressed by this film when I saw it fifteen years ago, and I'm still impressed with it today. It has enough action to satisfy any fan of 1970's Italian crime films, one of the most exciting genres in film history, but it also has a sobering message, one that is relevant to anyone watching the film anywhere. Although both CROSS CURRENT and GREAT TREASURE HUNT have their moments, THE BIG FAMILY is probably Tonino Ricci's most successful film as a director (I haven't seen his recent family films, although I especially want to see the Buck film with John Savage, nor have I seen the shark film with Treat Williams). Highly recommended to fans of the genre and those willing to see the value in a dubbed genre film.",
