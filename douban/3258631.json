    "introduction": "An innocent young man installs CCTV cameras for a living, and impulsively places one above the mirror of a beautiful dancer to watch her secretly. His gaze is chaste and he always shuts off the camera before he sees too much. But his employers have other ideas, as does a film director out to exploit the dancer for himself. Here, the camera doesn’t just capture - it possesses. Poet, novelist, and filmmaker Buddhadeb Dasgupta (CHASED BY DREAMS, 2nd HKAFF; MEMORIES IN THE MIST, 3rd HKAFF) brings us this seemingly light-hearted film where urban isolation and technology can pervert even the purest of emotions.",
