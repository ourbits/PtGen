    "introduction": "Two decades after the war, a former camp inmate refuses to testify against a war criminal, her torturer from the concentration camp. Unable to find peace and forgetfulness in the post-war world, weighed down with anonymous neo-Nazi threatening letters, in spite of support which an ex-friend gives her, in the moment of disorder, she escapes to death. Produced by Aleksander Krstic, Artur Brauner, Peter Hahne, Die Zeugin aus der Holle is a 1967 Drama film directed by Zivorad 'Zika' Mitrovic, starring Irene Papas, Daniel Gélin, Heinz Drache and written by Frida Filipovic, Michael Mansfeld.The prosecuting attorney Hoffmann from the central office of the regional administration of justice for the enquiry into national socialist crimes in Ludwigsburg visits the writer Bora Petrovic in Belgrade who, shortly after the war, reported in a book about the crimes in German extermination camps which mentioned the statements made by Lea Weiss. Lea Weiss must now repeat her statement which she gave Petrovic in court as a witness against a concentration camp doctor. She refuses and claims that her starements were purely fictional. Hoffmann asks Petrovic to come to Germany with him to try and change Lea Weiss`mind. But all of Petrovic's attempts are in vain. The victim`s sense of shame is too large, in contrast to the notoriously good conscience of the perpetrator. In the concentration camp, Lea Weiss was forced into sexual activities with the camp commander and was later abused at medical examinations. 20 years after the end of the war, suicide becomes the solution to her desperate situation. The film reacts to the Auschwitz trial in Main from 1964-1965 in great detail.",
