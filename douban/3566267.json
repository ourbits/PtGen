    "introduction": "The Soviet Union in the 1960s. A little Nenets girl, Neko is taken against her will from her home tent to a boarding school in a remote Russian village. Forced to adapt to a foreign culture and new customs, she rebels against the Russification and gets bullied by her schoolmates and teachers. The story is framed through memories of Neko’s prototype. Now she recalls the moment that ended her childhood and started her life as a part of a different society. This is the final instalment of the second Nenets trilogy, formed by fiction films interwoven with autobiographical motives from Lapsui’s life.源自：https://doclisboa.org/2023/en/filmes/pudana-last-of-the-line/",
