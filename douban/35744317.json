    "introduction": "Putting in dialogue photographs and films of the period with the voice of Céleste Albaret and readings of extracts of his work, Thierry Thomas leaves, in the steps of the writer Marcel Proust, who disappeared almost a century ago, in search of this \"lost time\" that he saved from oblivion. Surveying the Parisian district of the Madeleine, the promenade of Cabourg or even the writer's childhood resort in the vicinity of Chartres, renamed Illiers-Combray in his honor, this documentary plunges into a bygone era to bring to life the monument of literature that has come to embody it all in the imagination.",
