    "introduction": "The dry season is always a struggle for the animals in the in the Luangwa Valley in Zambia - forced to share the last remaining water in the river. This is most strongly felt by the hippo population as they continually need to submerge their overheating bodies. This year the low river will be the least of their worries: An unseen killer is waiting to attack. The congested river and extreme circumstances provide the perfect conditions for an Anthrax epidemic to strike. Before the return of the rains the dominant hippo bull will witness the devastation of a fifth of his pod. This season a young mother and her calf and two brothers must negotiate these terrible odds and try to survive this...Hippo Hell.每年的前半年，位于赞比亚的卢安瓜河谷都是一片郁郁葱葱；但是随着气温的升高，到了旱季，那里就会出现炙热干涸的景象。然而这个旱季与往年不同，对于生活在这里的世界上最大的河马群来说，阳光是这个旱季最小的问题，因为潜伏在暗处的安静的杀手，将会对它们的生存带来最大的挑战。",
