    "introduction": "The movements, routines and gestures that compose an ordinary day in the life of an ordinary housewife, recorded in the minutest every more oppressive details, become a sort of catalyst by the unique and simple means of having the woman played by a man with long hair and a slightly androgynous look. For one of the most troubling aspects of this man’s performance is that, with his gestures, he offers a brilliantly precise imitation of a woman without ever resembling a woman, which makes the daily tasks, the repetitions and habits of an “average housewife” appear both surreal and terribly familiar.",
