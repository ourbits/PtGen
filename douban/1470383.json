    "introduction": "Interestingly, in 1995, two 10 hour mini series about the history of Rock & Roll aired on television. One was this (produced by Time-Warner), and the other was PBS' \"Rock & Roll\". It is important to know that this is not the documentary that was aired on PBS. This is a lighter take on the history of rock & roll, focusing more on the entertainment aspect as opposed to the more \"documentary\" orientation of the series that aired on PBS.This is the first of 10 part series on history of Rock n Roll. Each of the parts are arranged in chronological order and this episode deals with the very beginning of Rock n Roll from early '50s to mid '50s. All time early Rock n Roll greats like Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Louis appears to show the formative years of Rock n Roll.Rock music in the beginning was not widely accepted due to all of its players being of black ethnicity. Sam Phillips of Sun Records were recording black rock n roll musicians but couldn't break the barrier, until Elvis Presley walked in the door. Sam Phillips immediately knew that this was his ticket, and attached a band to Elvis to promote him as his star.The first episode is based on these developments, as rock music gradually finds its way into mainstream America",
