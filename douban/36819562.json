    "introduction": "Good Morning Kandahar introduces us to young men and women torn between a deep desire to help Afghanistan and fear that things will never change. Some are enthusiastic. There’s ‘Dewa’, who broadcasts pop songs, recipes and beauty tips to Kandahar on RANA-FM. And Yahseer. who enjoys the freedom of Canada’s nightlife, but by day broadcasts to tradition-bound Kandahar – mostly good news, plus warnings to keep back from NATO convoys.Good Morning Kandahar is a moving and rich film that brings a badly needed personal perspective to a painful controversy.Good Morning Kandahar was produced as part of the Reel Diversity Competition for emerging filmmakers of colour. Reel Diversity is a National Film Board of Canada initiative in partnership with CBC Newsworld.Ratings",
