The stories in the films were told to us by children, they share their thoughts about various world affairs with the viewers. We see and hear what children like and dislike, what they fear, hope and dream about. Also, the artwork of the films is inspired by children's drawings. At the screening, 2 episodes of the 6 episode animated series of short films will be screened.",
