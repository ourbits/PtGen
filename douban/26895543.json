    "introduction": "The Halfmoon Files is an audio-visual research project on the entanglements of politics, colonialism, science and media technology. It investigates an elusive archive of audio and film recordings documenting Indian and North African prisoners who were interned in the Halbmondlager (or “Halfmoon camp”) near Berlin during World War I. It is a film about gaps, omissions and the construction of history. A film whose protagonists are not visible – but whose presence can be sensed. In short: a ghost story.",
