    "introduction": "Maryam d'Abo suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage in 2007 and is lucky to be alive. Her experience inspired this film and leads the viewer on a personal journey of recovery, giving a sense of hope to those who are isolated by their condition that is not seen therefore often misunderstood. Many first hand stories celebrate man's life force and his will to survive. The film concerns all human beings, dealing with the fragility of the extraordinary brain of which we know surprisingly little.",
