    "introduction": "Dee, a non-binary freelance illustrator, is locked into a lease they can't afford. Dee's younger sister, Amy, enacts a plan to find the perfect roommate. Enter Rachel, a queer British bartender eager to fit in as a Canadian. Months later, things go from cool to not-so-cool when Rachel reveals a startling secret - she's claimed Dee as a common-law partner to evade being deported. Amy prompts the pair to create a YouTube channel to prove they are madly in love, and definitely not faking it. Will Dee and Rachel make a convincing couple after all, or are they just couple-ish?
