    "introduction": "\"El Último Bandoneón\", a film recently premiered in Buenos Aires theaters, can be understood as a generational bridge, but also as a window to Buenos Aires' state of mind. Directed by Alejandro Saderman, this film may lead to some confusion, as it uses a fictional \"excuse\" to create a documentary about tango and -essentially- about the city that shelters that instrument. The \"fictional excuse\" is also based on a true story: Marina Gayotto plays a struggling young bandoneón player; while Rodolfo Mederos plays himself, an experienced musician who extends time bonds with the past and the future, and dreams of starting a typical orchestra with young musicians. With these tools, Saderman develops a credible, delightful story.",
