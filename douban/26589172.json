Similar to the live casting specials featured in the first two seasons, the first three episodes consisted of separate regional auditions before proceeding to the official national-level competition. Shane Sparks did not return as a judge this season, due to his arrest, and was replaced by Omarion.[1] In the live finale, which aired on April 8, 2010, Poreotix was declared the winner.",
