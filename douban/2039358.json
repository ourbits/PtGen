    "introduction": "每个人在某个地方总有一个属于你的人存在。“我心狂野”就是让这种信念实现的故事。它讲述的是拉忽尔，一个不相信爱情的人的故事。拉忽尔不太理解人们是如何能够在一起相处一生，难道真的有人是属于他的吗？这又是关于坡佳，一个相信一定有人是属于她的，而且她一定能遇上那个人的女孩的故事。这还是关于妮莎，一个认为爱情就是友谊，终有一天她的梦想会实现的故事。这部电影还有出色的音乐献给那些有梦想而充满热情的人们。他们的梦想能实现吗？他们能找到他们的真爱吗？影片将让我们相信每个人在某个地方总有一个属于你的人存在。Dil to pagal hai is a fantastic film. Its my all time favorite.I love to watch Yash Chopra films and among them its the best one. Since the year it released i.e 1997 no other film has touched me like this.My extreme love for DTPH is because of following reasons.. ->Its tag line touches me i.e someone somewhere...is made for you. ->Its story line and Yash Chopra's perfection as a director. ->Its superb music by Uttam Singh and above all LATA MANGESHKAR's melodious duets with Udit Narayan.I love its songs; and in them, Lataji's voice (even more than old songs of Lataji) ->Uttam singh's background instruments rock me whenever i listen to the numbers. ->Shahrukh Khan's first performance in which he didnot deliver dialogs in the way like he earlier used to.He was very serious and his acting was quite,calm and mature.For the same reason he got several awards for this film. ->Madhuri's performance was great and so was of Karisma.Both got awards and Karisma also got her first National Award. ->I love its screenplay specially in the shots having an acting stage within the film.(See its climax to confirm what i said.) MUST SEE IT AFTER READING MY COMMENTS IF YOU ARE NOT SATISFIED WITH ME. I AM SURE YOU WILL ALSO BECOME A DTPH FAN LIKE ME.",
