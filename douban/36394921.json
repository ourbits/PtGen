Paralyzed by her life wrangling cattle in Alberta, Canada, Charlotte jumps into her Ford Bronco, flees her over-controlling husband, and lands back in her childhood Park Avenue apartment where she takes refuge with her mother Kit. Rediscovering the boy she loved, now her grown doorman Anders, and the life she left at 18, the mother and daughter explore shared history, unshared truths and find a way to face both love and loss.",
