    "introduction": "Eakam a philosophical fiction thinly based on the life of Shiva. This type of genre is never been attempted in Telugu. It's has been shot at a record span directed by a debutant B Varun Vamsi under the banner Ananda Thoughts production company and A Kalyan Sastry's Samskruthi Productions. Though there were certain limitations we roped in a young team and shot in various different locations in and around Hyderabad. The undercurrent of the film is a spat on the current stereotypical society. It's a new age drama which follows the five elements of nature viz. Earth fire wind water and sky. The 5 main characters represent each element n how the story unfolds by the jobless god talking about oneness of human souls is the crux of the film.",
