    "introduction": "Part 1: Did God Create the UniverseStephen Hawking unfolds his personal, compelling vision of the biggest question of all – who or what created the universe in which we live? In this programme, physics and cosmology become tools to answer questions that philosophers have struggled with for thousands of years.Stephen Hawking unfolds his personal, compelling vision of the biggest question of all: Who or what created the universe in which we live? The groundbreaking series Into the Universe with Stephen Hawking combined cutting-edge CG with Hawking's witty, distinctive and incisive worldview. Now, we take the journey a step further, as physics and cosmology become tools to answer questions that philosophers have struggled with for thousands of years.Part 2: Alien Invasion are We ReadyWe've read the books, we've seen the movies. War of the Worlds, V, Independence Day. But they're all fiction, right? Well, probably not. New science is suggesting that aliens may be very real, and that they may not be as cuddly as E.T. Host Michelle Rodriguez (Avatar, Battle: LA) brings together top scientists and military strategists to dramatize what would happen if and when aliens attack.Part 3: Why is Sex FunOrgasm - one of the most intense pleasures we can experience. But what are orgasms actually for? In men, the answer's simple - reproduction. But women don't need an orgasm to get pregnant. So why have them? With cutting edge science and research, Maggie Gyllenhaal hosts this revealing investigation into the mystery of the orgasm.Part 4: What Sank TitanicIt has been almost 100 years since the sinking of the Titanic. We think we know the story, but how much do we actually know about what went wrong? In the aftermath of the disaster, a full trial was conducted. This Curiosity Volume 1 DVD gives us a unique take with harrowing first person testimony from those who survived. This special will take those highly emotive human stories and for the first time use them as pieces of an enormous detective story. We will forensically piece together the precise mechanics of what went wrong and answer this question: How was the greatest piece of structural engineering in human history defeated by one of the simplest elements on the planet - water?Part 5: Whats Beneath AmericaEverything which has made America bountiful and powerful is a product of forces which date back billions of years. How have earth's ancient forces made America what it is today? How did they create the gold that set California on a course to become the richest state in the Union, and how did vast sheets of ice enable Kansas to produce enough wheat to give six loaves of bread a year to every single person on earth? Using an array of dazzling visual effects, we connect past and present, showing how ancient geology has shaped modern America and its people.Part 6: How Will the World EndThe Mayans tell us it will happen next year, on 21st December to be precise. And terrible recent events from Indonesia through Haiti to Japan seem, to some, evidence of impending global doom. But just how likely is a global apocalypse – from a scientific point of view? When will it happen, if at all? Where? And how? Samuel L. Jackson hosts this CGI spectacular which examines the most likely ways the world might end, and uses the latest geological, seismic and telescopic devices to put a number on the likelihood of their occurrence, the timeframe within which they’ll take place, and even the potential casualties. It’s almost certainly not going to happen in our lifetimes, nor in that of any of our children or grandchildren…Part 7: I Caveman Back to the Stone AgeWere we better off as cavemen? Morgan Spurlock (\"Super Size Me\") joins nine ordinary men and women in an attempt to survive in the wild using only stone-age technology. Cold, dehydration, and hunger threaten to derail the experiment from the The last ten thousand years have seen change on a scale previously unimaginable. From the first settlements around Ur and Catal Huyuk through the latest innovations in medicine, technology, travel and connectivity, we live in a world that would be utterly unrecognizable to our early ancestors. But alongside all this technological change, how much have we, as humans changed? Our bodies? Our minds? In this extraordinary social experiment, ten modern humans travel back in time to live like our earliest ancestors.Part 8: I Caveman the Great HuntEating only what they hunt and gather, wearing only what they tan and weave. With only a cave for shelter and only each other for company, they will use nothing but paleolitic techniques and technology as they attempt to survive for a month. Will they rise to the challenge of caveman living, or race back to their centrally heated, super-connected lives? Welcome to the ultimate exploration of human evolution and technological advancement. Will they rise to the challenge of caveman living, or race back to their centrally heated, super-connected lives? Welcome to the ultimate exploration of human evolution and technological advancement.Part 9: Can You Live ForeverWill we one day be able to live forever? If so, when? In 2011, Adam Savage was 43. Now it is the year 2967 and he is 1000 years old. He looks back on his long life revealing how medical science in the 21st century transformed his body, creating a supercharged cyber-human, allowing him to love forever. Along the way, we’ll learn about transhumanism, brain downloads, self-regenerating organs, and full body transplants – all in the name of becoming the world’s first 1000 year-old man.looks back on his long life revealing how medical science in the 21st century transformed his body, creating a supercharged cyber-human, allowing him to love forever.
