    "introduction": "Adapted from the acclaimed book ‘Bloody April’, and chronicling the same period of history that inspired the Hollywood smash-hit, 1917, this hard-hitting feature explores a decisive period in the history of World War 1, namely, April 1917.  In this single five week period, the Royal Flying Corps suffered huge losses, but displayed a courage, tenacity and fortitude that would ultimately lead to success, but at great cost.Examined in astonishing detail is the brave new world of dogfights, aerial reconnaissance and bombing missions, all seen through the eyes of those pioneering men in the air and the many thousands fighting in the trenches below.Reconstructing stories from the real-life letters, diaries and interviews of World War 1 veterans through stunning VFX and exclusive access to replica aircrafts, explore the incredible true story of the Royal Flying Corps’ struggle for air superiority over the Western Front like never before.E1.
