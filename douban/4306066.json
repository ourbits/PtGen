    "introduction": "León Gieco 09阿根廷巡演纪实.Mundo Alas is a road movie showcasing a special group of young artists accompanied by singer León Gieco on a tour through different provinces of Argentina. Musicians, singers, dancers, and painters with different disabilities present their vision of the world in a show where rock, folklore, and tango have a prominent place, along with León Gieco's songs. Throughout the tour we have a glimpse of their life’s stories and artistic evolution and relationships that show that integration is possible.Mundo Alas is a movie about freedom, love and music. Many believe it is a claim about how much disabled  people suffer. However, it is an extremely happy film and I think that people cry because of the impotence they feel when they realize they have been complaining about silly things all their lives.",
