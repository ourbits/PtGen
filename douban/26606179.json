    "introduction": "It is summer and five overly-seasoned college students have been given the task of writing a group paper on Franz Kafka\"s \"The Country Doctor.\" At first they are reluctant, but in a cloud of hashish they come up with the idea to film the story instead. Their film location is a campsite in Sicily, which they had already booked ages ago for summer vacation. The technical department consists of a couple \"unique\" men from the Vienna film scene. To everyone\"s surprise, they even manage to get Kafka himself to play a supporting role in the film. KAFKA, GANJA, MANIACS parodies bizarre artists in a crazy road movie with some animation, video clips, and musical interludes mixed in. Incidentally, Kafka himself also gets the chance to revise his life story and finally live out the rest of his days in happiness.",
