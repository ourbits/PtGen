    "introduction": "POLISARIO, UN PEUPLE EN ARMES, a documentary made for TV co-produced with Algerian television is Med Hondo’s second film devoted to his support for the Saharawi people’s right to self-determination in Western Sahara. Shot in one of the rare former Spanish colonies in Africa, the film chronicles a last clash between Morocco (that has occupied much of the Western Sahara after Spain ended its colonial rule in 1975) and the Polisario (The Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and Río de Oro) before the signing of a ceasefire.Relying more on images than words, the film foregrounds actual battle scenes in which the crew found themselves in this context of armed struggle of a people sacrificed on the altar of geopolitical interests.",
