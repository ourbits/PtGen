    "introduction": "The film will introduce the world not only to famous filmmaker Roy Andersson, but also to his brothers. Directed by Andersson’s niece, Johanna Bernhardson, the film promises to be “intimate and humorous”, even though the siblings in question lost contact and rarely speak to one another. “Their relationship is tense, but Johanna is determined to unite them again before it is too late,” stated the team, adding that despite their differences, the brothers still have one thing in common – they all drink too much.",
