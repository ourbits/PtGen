    "introduction": "Isolated in his residence room, an old man does everything in his power to see the woman he loves one last time. Quebecois filmmaker Robin Aubert (known for À l'origine d'un cri and Les Affamés) pays a touching and unprecedented tribute to the elderly, healthcare workers, and volunteers in long-term care homes (CHSLD) who acted in the midst of the pandemic. It's a beautiful and unconventional work that disarms those who delve into it. A strong and socially engaged narrative about the state of the healthcare system, it delves into an essential topic that concerns us all: the end of life.",
