    "introduction": "A poetic portrait of an Iranian watchmaker, whose philosophical musings on craft invite us to reflect on how we engage with time in a fast-paced world. Moving between his colourful pared-down home and workshop, and the streets and windswept marshes of East London, we discover the horologist's ascetic and beautiful private world.",
