    "introduction": "SKAM ESPAÑA is a portrait of the generation of boys and girls born since the year 2000. Their doubts, their problems, their feelings, what they think, what they want and, above all, what they don't say and what they are ashamed of. The series accompanies a group of 16-year-olds on the journey of their life following their day to day in real time. Dependence on social media, how they face sex, love and ruptures, the search of their identity and the need to fit in. Since its premiere in 2015 in Norway, SKAM broke audience records, it was praised by critics and audiences, swept Norwegian television awards and has been sold to the US, (Skam Austin, broadcast on Facebook), in addition to France, Germany, or Italy, among other territories. The rights for Spain were acquired by Movistar +, which decided to trust Zeppelin (Endemol Shine Iberia) to develop SKAM ESPAÑA.",
