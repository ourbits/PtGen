He follows the fortunes of rare black-throated divers and white-tailed sea eagles, which both breed there, while capturing the red deer and salmon whose lives also revolve around the loch.With an evocative score provided by local musician Phil Cunningham, this enchanting film captures the magic of a very special place.",
