    "introduction": "Ralph Arlyck has never denied his urge to pick up a camera and document his life on film. Now, as he approaches his 80s, he delicately stitches this archive together to craft a compelling reflection on mortality, community, and the passage of time. Like having a conversation with an excellent interlocutor, I Like It Here meanders through a life well-lived; guiding us through portraits of Arlyck’s loved ones as he ponders on the undeniability of aging and death. Layers of time and connection unfold as footage shot across multiple decades interplay with each other; blurring the firm boundary between past and present. From an influential figure in American independent documentary, this gentle and personal essay embraces the beauty of everyday life, reminding us of the simple pleasure of being alive.",
