    "introduction": "Of all operas, perhaps the one that least needs ingenious extra musical assistance is \"Tristan,'' this aurally erotic work that speaks so vividly to the listener's inner eye. Wagner's score is simply more illustrative and sensuously pictorial than any series of stage pictures could be. With Ren茅 Kollo and Gwyneth Jones in the title roles, this DVD represents a historical milestone and document of highest value in the reception of Richard Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde.\" \"Here are no bounds to the longing, the desire, the bliss, and the anguish of love. The world, power, fame, glory, honor, chivalry, loyalty, friendship...all are swept away. Only one thing is left alive...yearning, yearning, insatiable desire....\" Richard Wagner Recorded live during a guest performance by The Deutsche Oper Berlin at The NHK Hall, Tokyo, 1993.This release captures a performance of the Richard Wagner opera Tristan and Isolde recorded at the Deutsche Oper Berlin, and stars Rene Kollo and Gwyneth Jones in the leading roles. Supporting players include Gerd Feldhoff, Robert Lloyd, and others.This is the only Shuji Fujii video.",
