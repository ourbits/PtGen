    "introduction": "When we meet George (Ken Finkleman) again, he's no longer trying to be... well, such a good dog. Ditched by his live-in girlfriend Claire, it's onward and upward for George, who reconnects with old flame Virginia Hailwood (Lolita Davidovich, Gods and Monsters, Play it to the Bone), the socialite daughter of a very wealthy - and very conservative - media baron. When opportunity knocks, George answers, and quickly finds himself the head of Daddy's newest concern: the yet-to-launch Canadian arm of a right-wing American TV news network called Right News. Never one to let a simple clash of ideologies get in the way of a chance for a private executive bathroom, George is sure he's up for the challenge at work.",
