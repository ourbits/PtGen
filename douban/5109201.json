Just because they are chosen to find the Philosopher's Stone. During their journey they find even more. Maybe it's love, but maybe it's just a feeling that will disappear with the dawn. Who knows? \"Love in this case will prevail over all,\" says Jan Němec, \"is neither defined nor filled.\" The story takes place not only in today's Czech Republic, but also in the real seat of power - Washington, DC Are part of the film and documentary footage of the recent past in which the creator reveals their true historical context.
