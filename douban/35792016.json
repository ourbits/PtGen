    "introduction": "This broad-ranging documentary film series by Filmaattiset Ltd covers the history of Finnish ice hockey from the late 1920s to the 1995 World Championships. The series familiarises us with the early years of Finnish ice hockey and with the general development of the sport. We also get to see some of the Finnish national team’s most bitter defeats and greatest triumphs, and to hear reminiscences by a host of hockey icons from Ketola to Koivu and From Kummola to Kurri.",
