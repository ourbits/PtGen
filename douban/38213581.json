    "introduction": "When Sarah Millican was a bairn, she wouldn't say boo to a goose. Quiet at school, not many friends, no boobs 'til she was 16. Now? NOW she is loud, with good friends, a cracking rack and goose booing all over the shop. In LATE BLOOMER, Sarah's seventh stand-up special, she explores how one became the other. Plus, lots of stuff about dinners and lady gardens. Laugh at her, with her, beside her.",
