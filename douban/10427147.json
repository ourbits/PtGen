    "introduction": "Twinkletoes is sleeping on the counter at the \"Wide-Awake Delivery Service.\" when Mysto the Magician telephones and wants his magical paraphernalia picked up at his home and delivered to the theatre in five minutes. The twinkly-one runs to the magician's house, picks up the heavy suitcase and flitters off in a hurry. But the case pops open and out pops Mysto's magical hat and other tools-of-the-trade. The rabbit escapes from the hat and Twinky has to chase it, while being flabbergasted at the magical display going on all around him. Will he get to the theatre on time?",
