    "introduction": "André, Daniel and Michel were physically and emotionally abused as children in a Catholic institution. Clémence Davigo documents their process of coming to terms with the past and the demands for compensation and recognition in carefully chosen camera perspectives and sensitive montage. We see how the three men face their past and how much their friendship helps them to do so - while the institutions fail to provide real support or to make amends.源自：https://www.kasselerdokfest.de/en/screenings/s-d3755a69-d12d-9243-a0c2-8cb372d54dee",
