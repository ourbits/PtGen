    "introduction": "In 2000, Riefenstahl returned to East Africa to revisit the Nuba she photographed in the late 70s, whose pictures restarted her career. Of course, this was not as simple as it sounds in war-torn Sudan and might easily have been her last trip. Her helicopter crashed and she was briefly reported dead. This is the story of her voyage and what she found there. The film maker also takes a closer look at her private life. It features many of Riefenstahl's well-known Nuba photos and some Nuba film explained by Leni, all of it in contrast to the realities of modern Sudan.",
