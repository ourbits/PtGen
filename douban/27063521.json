    "introduction": "THE SINGING NAPKIN is the first full-length feature film in art school history which is also the diploma of fourth-year acting students from the POLISH NATIONAL FILM SCHOOL IN LODZ. The film's director, who is the rector of the School, Mariusz GRZEGORZEK created with young actors a beautiful, moving and ambiguous film. WHAT DOES THE NAPKIN SING ABOUT? ABOUT COURAGE - the young actors were not afraid of restrictions, they told their stories from their hearts - stories which tried to be both authentic and wise as well as crazy and silly. ABOUT ASKING QUESTIONS, IN ORDER TO TOUCH MYSELF IN ORDER TO TOUCH YOU.",
