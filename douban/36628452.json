    "introduction": "The SPACE KNIGHTS are a group of slightly outdated superheroes who drive Honda accords that when linked together, can transform into a variety of giant robots, from a pterodactyl, to a giant T-Rex, to a saber tooth tiger. They use these and other powers to stop a never ending stream of bizarre creatures and insane villains. The irreverent comedy follows the misshapen adventures of the crime-fighting team who must battle bickering and in-fighting almost as much as the external foes they face.",
