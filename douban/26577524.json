    "introduction": "Things get under way with \"The Haunted House,\" a dark tale of a murderous suitor with a penchant for killing pretty young girls. The second story details the frightening events that unfold when a young innocent named Sarah ventures into the bone yard to recover a walking stick. Caught under the spell of a creature too horrible for words, she is helpless to resist its diabolical charms. The third story, entitled \"Little Billy's Bones,\" finds the son of a woodcutter falling prey to his murderous new stepmother, and things wind to a close in \"White Wolf,\" in which a small town butcher makes a mint ridding the streets of wild wolves. When he reaches 500 kills and retires with money to spare, he finds himself faced with the prospect of hunting one last wolf.这个是由三个故事组成的电影，我也懒得翻译了",
