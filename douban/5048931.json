Bayo's mother wants to move to Toronto and leave their tiny village. But once ashore, Philip feels driven back to sea - on his own terms. And Bayo wants to remain in Tickle Cove with his grandfather and mother. As opposing plans clash against each other, all three learn to come to terms with themselves, with each other, and with their destiny.",
