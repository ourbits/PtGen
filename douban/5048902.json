    "introduction": "A lonely, striking older woman and a shy young student who delivers flowers as a part-time job are attracted to each other in this engaging story. It is the mid-1960s and Hermann (Torstein Hølmebakk) buys Beatles records like everyone else, he also indulges in an erotic magazine or two to satisfy a growing curiosity about sex, and he is not actively pursuing his occasional date Unni (Karoline Waal). Instead, Hermann's imagination has been quickened by Rose (Lise Fjeldstad), a woman who orders flowers for herself on a regular basis. As Rose tells Hermann the story of how she used to work in the circus in a trapeze act but was deserted by her lover when she became pregnant, Hermann is even more enthralled by her appeal as a woman...and a close encounter of the traditional kind seems almost inevitable.",
