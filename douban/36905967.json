    "introduction": "Only a few tracks remain today of the first railway line built in 1827, hidden in the wild grass near Saint Etienne…The saga of railways is an invitation to travel through two centuries. This documentary traces the way railways transformed our country and our way of life. The story is told by railway workers who know the whole adventure from the inside and pass it on from one generation to the next.In an epic tale that mixes technological miracles, historical events and personal testimony, we discover that the train has a unique capacity to tell us about France, the French and the country as a whole.[Credits]PHOTOGRAPHY: Jérôme ColinSOUND: Yolande Decarsin, Jean-Luc CescoEDITING: Laure-Alice HervéORIGINAL SCORE: Pablo PicoPRODUCTION: Agat Films · Muriel MeynardPARTNERS: France Télévisions · Procirep - Angoa · CNC",
