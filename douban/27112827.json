    "introduction": "Buenos Aires is the psychoanalytic capital of the world boasting twice the number of therapists per head than New York. Through years of state terror and economic disaster millions of Argentines have sought refuge on the analyst's couch. Such a demand for an expensive and time consuming exercise suggests a neurosis on a national scale. Like the analyst, this film puts Argentina on the couch to find the roots causes of this unique obsession.- Written by Simon Deeley",
