    "introduction": "Lausanne, Switzerland. In a downtown building about to be demolished, the workers and construction noises are everywhere. Julian, barely twenty years old, not only lives here, but is also responsible for the last resident, Stefan, whose apartment is leaking with water. He needs to find a solution so that neither of them will end up on the street. Julian is both the prophet of doom and the representative of a powerless authority who can only make empty promises. They are merely out of childhood and dealing with a situation too big for them.",
