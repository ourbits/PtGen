What these stories have in common is their expression of the way relational dysfunction prompts people to enact physical and/or emotional violence against themselves, each other or society. This common theme may be represented by a physical object or act that is not necessarily relevant to the plot, but which serves as a visual metaphor for the challenges facing different characters in different situations, who are confronted by the same problems.",
