    "introduction": "Aidan, a young man crippled by loneliness and insecurity, wants nothing more than to experience love, but he compulsively ghosts any connections he makes through dating sites. Aidan's co-worker Elaine, generous with her advice and kindness to a fault, encourages him to put himself out there -- although, in her heart of hearts, she wishes he would pick up on her feelings for him. Everything changes when Chelsea, beautiful and distant, moves into the apartment across the hall from Aidan's. The two feel an instant connection based on their refusal to engage in social norms, and bond over an unusual hobby. This chance encounter throws Aidan into a spiral of dangerous infatuation that will alter all three of their lives. Touching on themes of loneliness, obsession, and the brutal nature of relationships, We Die Alone assesses the aftermath of what happens when three isolated people with different ideas of love become dangerously entwined.",
