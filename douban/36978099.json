    "introduction": "Julian Cabeza is a rock musician who released his first album at the turn of the century, which became cult over time. Of a selfish and difficult character, he has moved away from the public light; his blows to the ego and his fear of failure have led him to complete musical silence. All of the above has meant that his 20-year relationship with Aline, his great love, is almost in total ruin. Isolated in his cabin on the coast, he will meet a couple in their twenties - Isabel and Dario - who carry their own conflicts and doubts. A friendship of a few days will arise between them, while they share stories, memories, disappointments and losses.",
