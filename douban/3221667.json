    "introduction": "又是一部超经典超有趣的委内瑞拉黑色喜剧片，同样来自委国最知名的喜剧片导演Alfredo Anzola，还记得上次那部纯拉美爱情风味的《安妮塔怎么会去倒追马里奥呢？》（1986）吗？这个导演的作品片名取得都挺古怪的，很有意思！：）5+A chef is shot and killed in the kitchen of a restaurant. They put his body in the walk-in freezer and it is life and business as usual.I saw this comedy by the time it was release (1984) and I always remembered it. Is a funny story that takes place in the \"Dia de las secretarias\", a sort of holyday for the secretarys and the invitations to have lunch and \"something more...\". In this film release in \"Beta\" format and I guess never in DVD, there are several couples in a restaurant for lunch and most of all the plot takes place in there, when a frustrated robbery take place. Is a good plot without to much ambition but plenty of funny situations and good acting. The director (Alfredo Anzola) who direct \"Fiebre\" in 1976, \"Manuel\" in 1979, and \"El misterio de los ojos escarlata\" in 1992, achieve again a good work in this one, as he did in all his movies. This time with several actors and actress like Alejo Felipe, Luis Rivas,Victor Cuica,Elba Escobar, Cecilia Todd,Alejandro Corona, Yajaira Paredes,Asdrubal Melendes,Julio Mota,Graciela Alterio, Miguel Angel Landa,Elisa Escamez,Jose Rodriguez, Alba Roversi,Isabel Hungria, Lupe Gehrenbeck,Luis Carmona, Hector Campobello,Yenny Noguera,Adriana Villalba, Homero Garcia, Claudio Nazoa,Rolando Pena, Edmundo Rodriguez, Miguel Angel Perera,Mary Jubes,Edmundo Blanco, Josefina Acevedo y julio Neri all of them TV stars in that time. The story (Writer) is Pilar Arteaga, the photography made by Andres Agusti. Sound by Mario Nazoa and the music by Italo Pizzolante. A good light venezuelan comedy 8/10 BTW is a pity can't find it in DVD unless a copy from Beta.",
