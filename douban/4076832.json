    "introduction": "One winter night, Gulnara meets a novelist by chance, brings him home to her house, and spends the night with him. The writer tells Gulnara an interesting, original story that he wrote and Gulnara also tells him a story in response. It is about her past when she was in love with two men at the same time. But as they exchange their stories, the boundary between truth and fiction gradually become hazier and their obscure, yet sexy ‘Arabian Nights’ unfolds on screen. With films like [Revenge and The Place on the Tricome], Director Ermek Shinarbayev has already won many prominent awards at various international film festivals and has visited Pusan on several occasions. His latest film follows the two main characters arguing back and forth on something that happened in the past. And the main character Gulnara’s irresistible appeal will captivate the audience.
