    "introduction": "The revolutionary fervour that swept through Latin America in the 20th century owes much to the participation of millions of Christians who engaged in political struggles in the name of their faith. Driven by liberation theology, they paid a heavy tribute for undermining the traditional relationship between Church and Power. Far from Marx’s idea that religion is the opium of the people, here the people fought for the advent of the Kingdom of God on earth rather than in heaven.",
