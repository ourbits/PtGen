    "introduction": "Warfare in Algeria, 25 March 2015Author: GUENOT PHILIPPE (philippe.guenot@dbmail.com) from France*** This review may contain spoilers ***What a true masterpiece speaking of a war that very few movies have talked about. War in Algeria which France is not so proud of, if you compare the USA and the war in Vietnam. I only remember Yves Boisset's RAS and Florent Emilio Siri's L'ENNEMI INTIME, actually french productions to find any accurate and fair point of view about this horrible war. OK this one I talk about today is an Algerian film, with some french actors, but it is very powerful, describing the facts as they really occurred. The french authorities repression in the villages, the use of napalm and other atrocities. Some weird editing, where no real lead remains. The story focuses on some characters, for instance Jean-Louis Trintignant - the french deserter - or the Young Arab rebel, and then they suddenly almost disappear...Weird, but why not? A powerful gem from Algeria available on you tube video and old VHS tapes. And only there. Unfortunately. The director already gave us a TV movie that I commented five years ago: C'ETAIT LA GUERRE. Worth too.",
