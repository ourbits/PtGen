    "introduction": "While studying Rossini’s 1816 opera The Barber of Seville, a group of teenagers in Paris reflect on what love means to them.In a suburb of Paris, a high school class are studying Rossini’s 1816 opera The Barber of Seville. Engaging with a world so far from their own, they raise questions of what it meant to love back then, and what loves means to them now.With great trust between the filmmakers, the kids, and their teachers, Hearts sensitively unfolds their opinions in a series of interviews and intimate breaktime sequences, revealing how culture, class, religion, family, and education frame their perceptions, and how they slowly find their own paths.",
