This is another one of those ultra low budget Italian Westerns filmed on the ramshackle sets & familiar gravel pit owned and made by genre star Gordon Mitchell with his own resources and bare hands that served as the backdrop for about three dozen similar efforts made between 1970 and 1973 or so, a story that is actually more inspiring than the interchangeable threadbare plots of the films themselves.",
