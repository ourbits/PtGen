    "introduction": "This movie did not have too many spoken lines, it's main focus is on showing the viewer how the two people are bonding, becoming one, by their actions. You must have a tough stomache to endure the extreme gruesome scene in the movie. I couldn't eat for a few days after watching this movie. Most of all, it plays with your mind on a psychological level, so be extremely mentally strong in order to watch this. For those who are hard core horror fans, like myself, just thought that you should know that this movie is not a horror. It's about a human being's desires and executing those desires in real life. Bon Apetit!!",
