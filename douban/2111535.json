    "introduction": "When Peep Show arrived on our screens back in 2003, we were treated to a unique and original comedy by its partakers David Mitchell and Robert Webb. Now, two series later, Peep Show has become somewhat of a cult hit. Well, here’s an opportunity to see where it all began back with series one--possibly the best of the lot.Mitchell and Webb have been performing together for some time and it really shows; their comedic timing and on-screen relationship allowing you to feel for Mark (Mitchell) and Jeremy (Webb) as they plunders through their lives, trying to find love, and sex.But the real joy of the first series is in watching how their idea--to follow the story through the eyes of the two main protagonists, Mark and Jeremy--comes to fruition on screen. It’s a marvellous concept that works so well, being both unique and riotously funny at the same time.It’s helped by a strong supporting cast--notably Olivia Colman (starring as Mark’s lusted after colleague Sophie) who has since gone on to star in series such as the equally successful Green Wing.Peep Show is unique, different and, most importantly of all, a hoot. And with a bunch of decent extras on the disc, this is well worth picking up.--Mark Oakley",
