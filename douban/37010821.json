    "introduction": "Martial Roy has just married Louise Letarte, with whom he is madly in love, but now he is experiencing erectile problems, even though he was so vigorous. Martial and Louise are a modern couple in a Quebec (Canada) in the midst of a sexual revolution, so they talk openly about the problem. They use a variety of books, aphrodisiac foods, sensual dances, hypnotic sessions, sexy costumes, naughty friends and erotic decorations to revive Martial's libido. The couple's friends and family get wind of the situation and twirl around the couple, each one offering their advice and opinions. Martial, on the other hand, gets back in touch with a former mistress and ends up consulting a female doctor. While our protagonist is thinking about marriage annulment and suicide, he meets an eminent eccentric professor who has his own theory on the subject.",
