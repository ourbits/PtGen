    "introduction": "After an almost 10-year hiatus, the multi-award-winning Winnipeg filmmaker is back with a bold new outing: a two-hour, 20-minute film in 25 languages with few subtitles. Diaspora is an endearing, fascinating work with a remarkable premise. Taking the form of a daily chronicle, the film follows Eva, a young Ukrainian woman newly arrived in Winnipeg’s North End to build a new life. In this ghost town — where according to Guy Maddin, everyone walks to where they dream and is always lost — Dawson constructs a delightful theatre of the absurd where no one speaks the same language and communication is impossible.",
