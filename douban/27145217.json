    "introduction": "Karen celebrates the success of her first client, novelist Bridie Sellers, at a launch party - unlike David, who, after the scandal, is reduced to selling life insurance to old ladies. Pete, however, offers him an escape route, as financial advisor to wealthy Nikki Kirkbright, though his first day could have gone better. Adam secures IT work with charismatic American CEO Sarah Poynter and moves back into his old house with Matthew and David as his lodger. After initial hesitation Tina also joins them whilst Jenny fears the sack for whistle-blowing but is promoted instead.—don @ minifie-1",
