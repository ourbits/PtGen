    "introduction": "Brought up as the child of two ministers, Evangelical pastor Jana is struggling to practise what she preaches to her rural Slovenian parish. Extolling the virtues of sacrifice and commitment, she pursues her church career while her husband raises their daughter at home. But, as she ministers unconditional forgiveness to her followers, she struggles to turn the other cheek to her own traumas, both past and present. The patriarchy Jana serves requires that she, like many women, turn her reflections inward and find purpose in her suffering. How much healing can faith provide before her shame and sins trespass against her? Raw, emotional and completely relatable, one woman’s crisis of belief underscores a far more universal fight for accountability from those in power.",
