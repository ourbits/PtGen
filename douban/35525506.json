Faced with a shortage of teachers, and increasingly demanding parents, the board hires an interim head to get things in order. Pretty soon e-teaching takes over, with an actual robot replacing the teachers, and CCTV enabling over-involved parents to keep a constant eye on what's happening. Finding themselves up against this heartless new regime, pupils and teachers decide to join forces and rebel.",
