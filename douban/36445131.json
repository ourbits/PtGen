    "introduction": "The House of the Chosen is a criminal novel, a search for an intellectual guru of Poland who disappeared in unexplained circumstances. At the same time, on TV, a reality show \"The Mill of Hope\" that he invented is being realised.The House of the Chosen is also a story about the love experienced by the characters and the question of what it is and can be like in an era which makes it a fetish, while at the same time refusing its supraindividual source. In the novel, we look behind the scenes at the activities of the people within the media, its heroes, who prepare for us a picture of the world.",
