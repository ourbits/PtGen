    "introduction": "Terry and Tessa are married ex cult deprogrammers living in the San Francisco Bay Area. A \"deprogrammer\" is a professional contracted by families to kidnap people away from dangerous cults to counsel them back into their previous lives. Terry and Tessa's cryptic motto during their often verbally and physically abusive deprogramming process: \"For those who'd rather not drink the Kool-Aid, raise your kids on seltzer, bubble per bubble!\" For the last fifteen years, to make ends meet in an age when cults have become less prevalent, they have produced stylish, unintentionally humorous corporate media. When Terry and Tessa are suddenly called back into their old business, they realize they are rusty, and are hereby doing more harm to their new subject than good. Their unusual marital relationship, itself built on a number of strange domestic rituals, soon begins to unfurl...and reconstitute itself in a way that they did not expect.",
