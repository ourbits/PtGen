    "introduction": "Still move is a portrait of the Japanese choreographer Saburo Teshigawara, covering his famous piece » Absolute Zero « as well as his new work for the camera in the feature film » Bound «. The creation of a choreography is closely watched and talked about from the first day of rehearsal to the last day of principal photography. Teshigawara’s philosophy of dance and life from Zen to classical ballet is discussed in many interviews and debates. Still Move is an insight in the philosophy of one of the most important choreographers of our time.",
