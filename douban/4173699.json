    "introduction": "Long before the Internet escaped from the lab, connected the planet and redefined what it meant to use a computer.......there was a brave and pioneering band of computer users who spent their time, money and sanity setting up their home computers and phone lines to welcome anyone who called. By using a modem, anyone else who knew the phone number of these computers could connect to them, leave messages, send and recieve files.... and millions did.They called these places \"Bulletin Board Systems\", or BBSes. And their collections of messages, rants, thoughts and dreams became the way that an entire generation learned about being online.When the Internet grew in popularity in the early 1990s, the world of the BBS faded, changed, and became a part of the present networked world.. but it wasn't the same.- Baud introduces the story of the beginning of the BBS, including interviews with Ward Christensen and Randy Suess, who used a snowstorm as an inspiration to change the world.- Sysops and Users introduces the stories of the people who used BBSes, and lets them tell their own stories of living in this new world.",
