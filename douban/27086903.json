    "introduction": "Filmed by numerous Avengers and edited by two of them—Janet Baus and Su Friedrich—The Lesbian Avengers Eat Fire Too offers a rare insiders’ look at the New York group’s first year, from their initial groundbreaking demo in front of an elementary school in ‘92 to the incredible Dyke March in DC, where the Avengers ate fire in front of the White House, cheered on by an enormous crowd.The video supplements footage of actions with compelling portraits of real-life Avengers still giddy with their first experiences of taking to the streets as out dykes as well as hilarious interviews with puzzled tourists trying to answer the question, “Who are the Lesbian Avengers?” This film goes a long way towards providing an explanation.More than a historical document, the video also offers important insights about how to organize successful actions and motivate participants. Released shortly after the Avengers exploded nationally in 1993, it was an essential tool for sharing activist skills and recruiting members. Even today, it inspires as much as it does instruct. If they can do it, I can, too.",
