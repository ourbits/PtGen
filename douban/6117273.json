    "introduction": "Wonderfully archived, and told with a remarkable sense of intimacy, visual style, and musical panache, Susanne Rostock's inspiring biographical documentary, SING YOUR SONG, surveys the life and times of singer, actor, and activist Harry Belafonte. From his rise to fame as a singer--inspired by Paul Robeson--and his experiences touring a segregated country, to his provocative crossover into Hollywood, Belafonte's groundbreaking career personifies the American civil rights movement and impacted many other social-justice movements. Rostock reveals Belafonte as a tenacious hands-on activist who worked intimately with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., mobilized celebrities for social justice, participated in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, and took action to counter gang violence, imprisonment, and the incarceration of youth.",
