    "introduction": "Le Temps Suspendu (Frozen in Time) retraces the life and work of Marius Borgeaud (1861-1924), one of the most talented Swiss painters of his generation, next to Hodler and Vallotton. From Lausanne, where he was born in 1861, to Paris, where he died in 1924, to Brittany, where he painted most of his canvases, the film brings this inimitable artists story into the light. A privileged approach of the work of this outcast who managed to create a remarkable universe, unique and eternal. The film offers an opportunity to reflect on painting and on the process of creation as time goes on.",
