The two women barely tolerate one another and the son, a doctor simply turns himself off to avoid any confrontation with either. Into this environment, an armed intruder (Joe Lando) breaks in. He is eventually revealed to be an old family friend who was sent to prison for murdering his father, but he insists that the older woman's husband, now deceased, was the actual murderer. Slowly, all the characters have to explore past hidden secrets about themselves.",
