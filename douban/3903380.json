An odd film made by a Toronto filmmaker who interviewed record collectors in their homes and in their favourite haunt - the record store. For those who enjoyed High Fidelity and thought that Nick Hornsby's novel was a rip off of their life story, wait until you see this one! The director's thesis is that record collectors are obsessive compulsive and are using this pursuit to make up for something that is inherently missing from their lives.",
