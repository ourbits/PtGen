    "introduction": "The Confession is a Danish film, an intense chamber drama infused with a twist of underlying humor, that delves into the boundaries of guilt, consent, and memory. Loui and Jacob, old friends from film school, meet in an anonymous hotel room. What Jacob doesn't know is that Loui has planned the evening as a confrontation: he wants to challenge Jacob with an accusation of a sexual assault he may have committed against their mutual friend, Sofie. As the night unfolds and their versions of the truth collide, the confrontation escalates into a gripping and emotionally charged battle over guilt and responsibility. In the final act, Sofie, the central figure in their conflict, enters the story, adding unexpected perspectives to an already complex narrative. The film, a Danish adaptation of Richard Linklaters's Tape, written by Stephen Belber, balances its heavy themes with subtle humor, challenging the audience to reflect on what defines an assault and who owns the truth.",
