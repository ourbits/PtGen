    "introduction": "Can a twelve minute, black and white short, convey any true sense of the devastation wrought by the lengthy Belgian occupation/colonization of the Congo, and its disregard for its people in the aftermath of the civil war that put Patrice Lumumba in power, and then the machinations that led to his death? This one gives it a very fair shake.Eau (1997) won the prize of the French Community of Belgium at the International Film Festival of Namur, the Prize for Photography at the Media 10/10 Festival in 1997 and at the Festival \"Court Toujours\" in 1998.",
