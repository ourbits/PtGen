The time spent in Subotica will change Sonja’s life, especially after she and her ten-year-old daughter start having terrifying nightmares that sometimes come true. Accepting her unusual gift will help Sonja uncover a dangerous conspiracy hidden behind the alleged suicide – as well as a deeply buried secret from her past.",
