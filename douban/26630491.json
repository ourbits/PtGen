The series follows his attempts to find out why she has left him and how he can win her back... though it's less a journey than a floundering stumble in the dark towards the prize of returning his life to something approaching normality. Friends, family and colleagues are only too ready to offer advice to Murray about what he should do, and each week sees him adopt a new strategy to achieve his goal.",
