    "introduction": "Very popular Soviet Armenian musical about a talented singer, spoiled by his success. Old Yerevan courtyard with its own Universe. Young singer Arsen is not able to do with easy and early success. His family breaks up, his voice is strained. Vartush, loving friend of Arsen's family and his wife Ruzanna, helps him to regain his confidence, his career and his wife.Director Yuri Yerzinkyan had completed almost half of the film when censors from Moscow decided the tape was flawed and assigned a second director, Laert Vagharshyan to complete the film. However since both directors were close friends, they continued to work as a team.4 songs were composed by the then-almost-unknown composer Arno Babadzhanyan specifically for this film. According to surveys, up to now not a single day passes without one of these songs being broadcast by one of the Armenian radio channels.The movie was a vehicle for the starting actor Khoren Abrahamyan, who later received \"tons of love letters\" from young girls.",
