    "introduction": "The dead body of an unidentified man is discovered in the botanical garden of the National Museum in Sarajevo. Senior Police Inspector Edib Pašić is called to the scene. Pašić and his young colleague, inspector Medo Zec, do not place much importance on what they first believe was the accidental death or murder of a migrant, and the case initially draws no media attention. However, Ajla Pašić, who works as a journalist for local news site SLOBODA, stumbles upon the crime scene by chance. That same day, Edib’s war-time friend, Senči, returns to Sarajevo after a stint in prison. The disappearance of the body from the morgue and the ulterior motives of the museum’s employees draw the inspectors into a corrupt, pressure-filled network of personal grievances, hopelessness and international crime. As they investigate the case, they must dive into the present-day Sarajevo and make decisions that are hard to justify – but easy to understand.",
