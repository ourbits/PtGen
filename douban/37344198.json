    "introduction": "Flug 401 is a unique documentary short that follows flight attendants on a trip to New York. The film explores feminist themes and embracing new-wave cinematic aesthetics rarely seen in Icelandic film. Commissioned by Loftleiðir Airlines in 1966, the film portrays the attendants’ professional and personal lives during their New York layover. Beyond its observational content, “Flug 401” thoughtfully engages with themes of women’s liberation, stylistically reminiscent of French New Wave classics such as Agnès Varda’s “Cleo from 5 to 7” (1962).",
