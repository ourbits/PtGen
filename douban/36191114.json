    "introduction": "Dutch artist Guido van der Werve describes his first feature film as “autofiction”. Like a piece of classical music, it is structured in a series of movements and is an autobiographical story in which past and present are intertwined. In 2016, following a serious car accident, Van der Werve remained in a coma for a month. Nummer achttien recounts his difficult and miraculous rehabilitation also recalling scenes from childhood from which the difficult relationships with his parents emerge. It is composed of numerous elements: 8 mm films and paintings made by the artist’s father, a choir and an orchestra that occasionally enters the scene (in a cemetery, in a supermarket), an alter ego of the artist himself impersonated by a little red-haired girl. Locations from other previous videos by the artist appear, such as the family home in Papendrecht in the Netherlands, his home in Finland and the medical center in Berlin where he stayed after the accident, and immediately started to film his rehabilitation. The film is pervaded by a sense of melancholy even if there are moments of humor, and delves into the depths of human existence: how life can be fragile and, sometimes, absurd.源自：https://www.schermodellarte.org/en/film/nummer-achttien-the-breath-of-life/",
