    "introduction": "30 Years of history in 2 hours! El Juego de Arcibel clearly resembles the situation in many Latin American countries with a delicate metaphor. The story is quite smart, because resembles the stupidity of military power in the civil-war caused by the growing economical crisis, created by the interests of a bad management of the executive power. Another plus point I considered, was the ability to create a new country, the actors chosen for that (some of them are Premium really), among all the countries, gave the movie an incredible virtual sub-language of Spanish, merging the talking styles of Chile, Argentina, Spain, etc... The photography is clearly very professional, good scenery, some time swaps/dreams with non-expensive effects create a very nice atmosphere. The dialogs chosen are very complex, nice words, good use of Spanish language (something I appreciate very much cause that's my native language). Some people would say this movie is rather slow or boring, but's not a mainstream movie, even though it's OK and worth watching in my opinion if you want to have some fun, the movie itself is not boring and not very complex on the first read, the story is quite interesting and catching.",
