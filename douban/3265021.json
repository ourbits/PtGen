    "introduction": "Story begins in an unnamed German city where heavy-handed crosscutting introduces the two leads. Broke and desperate for the money to go home, washed-up American singer-songwriter Tom Brackett (Thomas) accepts an offer from his slimy agent (Bela B. Felsenheimer) to tour Russia and the Baltic States.On the road to Kaliningrad, Tom meets Russian Natascha (Bjorklund), who’s on the lam, having dumped her glowering Central European mafia don fiance, Karl (Helmut Berger), at the altar. Natascha is being chased by Karl’s thugs and so she steals Tom’s two most prized possessions, his Russian Gaz-13 “Tchaika” sports car and his Gibson guitar. But after listening to his CD on the car stereo, she falls in love with his music — pic’s first hint that the narrative is based on the Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice.Tom hitchhikes to Kaliningrad where he finds Natascha waiting, offering her services as tour manager. Inevitably, the odd couple’s bickering morphs into attraction, stimulated by vodka and a bout of nocturnal skinny-dipping. He learns she was raised on a bee farm and nicknames her “Honey Baby.”Cheesy, quasi-hardboiled narration by Tom occasionally points out the blindingly obvious. But film also injects some artery-clearing wit, as when Tom and Natascha find he’s been replaced by a Tom Brackett impersonator.Losing the car and all their money and possessions in an escape from Karl’s thugs — although Natascha somehow manages to generate a new wardrobe — the two, by now deeply in love, join a Russian circus.",
