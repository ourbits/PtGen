    "introduction": "Shababnikim, features a group of four Haredi students who study at a yeshiva in Jerusalem. One of them, Gedalya, is on the straight and narrow, while the other three prefer their Talmud study with a side of hanging out in the park, shopping at the mall and general goofing off. Shababnik is a Hebrew slang word for a Haredi youth who is off the path - but not entirely. Shababnikim don't leave the community, but stretch the limits of appropriate behavior and dilute the focus on intense study.",
