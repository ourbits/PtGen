    "introduction": "In Nummer veertien, home Guido van der Werve runs, bikes and swims nearly 1,200 miles, from the Church of the Holy Cross in Warsaw to Père Lachaise in Paris. The Parisian cemetery is the place where Frédéric Chopin is buried, minus his heart, which his sister secretly took to the Polish church to fulfill the composer’s last wish. Dressed in a black wetsuit and goggles, Van der Werve embarks on a journey back from Poland to France as if it were a triathlon, alternating running, swimming and cycling. The film is a requiem in three movements and twelve acts (the music was composed by the artist himself) in which three narratives intertwine: the journey completed as an Ironman marathon, an unreal return to his native Holland and some scenes inspired by the journey that Alexander the Great made from Macedonia to his final resting place in Babylon.源自：https://www.schermodellarte.org/en/film/nummer-veertien-home/",
