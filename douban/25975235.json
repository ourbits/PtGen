    "introduction": "Sangpae-dong Public Cemetery has served as a burial site for more than 5,000 unidentified deceased since the colonial era. These “unidentified” deceased belong to many different kinds of minority groups that have drifted in and vanished out by the political shifts in the history of Dongducheon. They include sex workers, smugglers, gangsters, drug dealers, “migrant” laborers, illegitimate children of the US soldiers and simply underprivileged Koreans. Apparently a peaceful flow of natural images and sound, this video piece is a delicately edited sequence knitted by the rules of formal interrelation, conceptual resonance and semiotic logic. An underlying tone is keen, subdued, yet intense, which leads viewers to question who is alive and dead, who is being silenced by whom.",
