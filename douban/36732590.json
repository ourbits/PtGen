Searching for meaning in the never-ending suffering and conflicts that echo the past, Turn in the Wound looks at the eternal quest for freedom in the face of oppression and military force. The voice of Patti Smith, reciting works by Artaud, Daumal and Rimbaud, joins the words of soldiers and people living in the combat zones in Ukraine and those of its President Volodymyr Zelenskyj.",
