    "introduction": "A community in the Californian desert that has lived outside the mainstream for over 60 years. A cluster of abandoned Scottish islands, overlooked by spirit guardians and populated by feral cattle. An active volcano on Montserrat in the Caribbean surrounded by an eerie exclusion zone. Ben Fogle explores long-forgotten landscapes and meets communities who live outside the realms of normality. What lessons might be learned from those whose lives have been influenced by these wild and remote locations?",
