    "introduction": "Funny things happen at night at the puppet theater – especially today, since there were jelly donuts for Grandma’s birthday! When the little green devil decides to run away and take the whole bowl for himself, a grand chase ensues – through the villiage, over water, and into the sky – as the other puppets try to reclaim their stolen treats. Although the devil eats all the treats, he is rightly punished with a terrible stomachache! This East German animation classic - awarded with the 1960 Silver Lotus at the New Dehli International Film Festival - is based on a picture book written by Nils Werner.",
