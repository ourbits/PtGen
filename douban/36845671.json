    "introduction": "Paid work as we know it, has been embedded deeply in our modern lives. Few choose to live their lives outside labour market and the practices of refusing to work are mostly absent in our collective imagination. What happens when the wage work norm is challenged? What kind of zones of freedom have been managed to be built inside and outside of wage work that has penetrated everywhere?The film tells about working class, which is united by the fight for freer and fairer work. Refusal and thereby taking control of your own life is one way to fight against the work and performance oriented culture.",
