    "introduction": "DECATHLON: THE CK AND RAFER JOHNSON STORY tells the story of Taiwan’s greatest Olympic hero, CK Yang, and his friendship and rivalry with the great American athlete, Rafer Johnson—a friendship that transcended race, nationality, and geography, and survived the pressures of the Cold War and the battle for civil rights. This is a tale of triumph, tragedy, and an enduring brotherhood that still resonates in these turbulent times.",
