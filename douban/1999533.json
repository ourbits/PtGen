    "introduction": "A blond and a raven-haired beauty move with verve and style through a changing landscape. The fabric of their dresses flows and floats, adding to their allure. One loses a shoe. A young man picks it up and pursues them on his bicycle. The gals hide and lose him when he encounters bad weather. They stop to enjoy flowers and then swim in a stream. He finds their clothes; birds snatch them from him and take them to the women, who set off again. A railroad handcart takes them to a switching station; they lock themselves in the control room. He dangles the shoe, they let him in; converging trains take their attention from play. Will they ever get together?",
