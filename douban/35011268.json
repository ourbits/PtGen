    "introduction": "Technical advisor for the film JFK (1991) goes over some of his theories as to what really happened for the assassination of John F Kennedy. Two different interviews are welded together here to get a few of his ideas by, these are basically the same theories that were brought up in the film JFK (1991). If you enjoyed what the movie had to offer theory-wise, you may want to see this to further your understandings of JFK's murder.—Rhyl Donnelly",
