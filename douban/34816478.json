    "introduction": "Full moon above the city of Paris. A young man crosses the city neighborhoods on his bike, when elsewhere a group of distinguished young people that seem to come from another planet, stroll, smoke and chat. The bluish lights of phones illuminate faces, the face of the young man with the bike contrasts with the dark blue sky which is not yet night sky. The title of the film, Olympus, draws its inspiration from the name of a popular area in Paris, Les Olympiades. French director Mati Diop captures this parisian night through the eyes and movements of her brother, the model Gard Diop. A dreamy trap score soundtracks Olympe and turns an ordinary night into a moment suspended in time.",
