    "introduction": "A haunting, dreamlike journey across grief, love, and memory, crafted by the Icelandic filmmaker Ari Alexander Ergis Magnússon, known for his daring explorations of identity, spirituality, and the line between reality and fantasy. The story follows an 85-year-old widower who mixes his late wife’s ashes into a cup of warm water and drinks it, recalling shared memories from their life together. With the assistance of his cheerful neighbor, he embarks on a journey into the realm of the living and the dead, encountering a series of eccentric companions: a self-centered doctor, a smooth-talking coffin salesman, a yoga teacher, mysterious nuns, a young Faroese bride-to-be, and the small faithful dog, Shadow. At once tender and full of black humor, Epilogues explores loneliness, love, and renewal. The film is based on a novel by the renowned Icelandic author Guðbergur Bergsson – described by Milan Kundera as “a great European novelist.”",
