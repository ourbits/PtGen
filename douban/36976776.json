    "introduction": "A set of machines seems to perform an unknown ritual on an unburied human skeleton found in the Atacama Desert.It appears all at once like an endless funerary rite, an operating theater, and the learning process and constitution of a specific subjectivity.The skeleton of a young man lies, as if asleep, in the oldest and driest desert on Earth, the testing ground for an exoplanet.What is performed, what is sensed, captured, and edited manifests the nascent constitution of a lifeless entity, as well as its expression.The film is a self-presentation that endlessly edits itself, without linearity, beginning, or end. Sensors in the exhibition space continuously generate changes in its editing.As the enigmatic ritual unfolds in real time in front of us, we witness a transactional operation between different realities, a passage between a bodyless entity and a lifeless human body.",
