    "introduction": "David Suzuki holds twenty-four honorary degrees from academic institutions around the world and has written forty-eight books. A household name synonymous with nature and science, he was voted one of the top ten greatest Canadians of all time in 2004, ranking ahead of Wayne Gretzky and Sir John A. Macdonald. He is best known as the host of the long-running CBC TV show The Nature of Things and as a pioneering and passionate environmentalist. At the age of seventy-five, he shows no signs of slowing down. By all measures David Suzuki is extraordinary, and you can't help but wish that everyone cared about the earth as much as he does. But what drove him to become the phenomenon he is? This engrossing documentary guides us through his life and reveals the key events and people that shaped him.",
