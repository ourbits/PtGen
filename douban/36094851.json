    "introduction": "What is coming out from the other side of the conversation? For parents, that conversation ends with suddenly having to reshape your ideas, plans, and relationship with your child. Through a series of interviews, this documentary fixes its lens on the mothers, fathers, grandparents, and guardians of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) individuals who have come out of the closet. The film looks into the relationships that are healthy and healed, as well as those in which the coming out process has fractured families. The film explores the ongoing reality of coming out. Every new job, new friend, new situation, simply put, coming out never ends. How coming out has changed the most fundamental relationship to our lives, across the height of the AIDS crisis, to the current generation of national marriage equality is what our film will celebrate. Being out is a journey, not a destination.",
