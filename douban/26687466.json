Through the consumption of charged-water, water that has been influenced by specific thoughts or energy, an experiment held by Dr. Arlen, John begins to revisit his daughter through past memories in an dreamlike world. Through this healing process, memories that were once filled with the weight of guilt begin to speak truth. With such a change, John becomes convinced that he has the ability to change past events and make everything the way it used to be.",
