    "introduction": "The story follows Flavio Bretagna as he makes his way to the most important work meeting of his life. Juggling phone calls from clients, messages left on his voicemail and calls from his ex-wife, Flavio climbs behind the wheel of his car and sets off towards this event which he has been waiting for for so long. Swamped by a deluge of calls, he takes a wrong turning and ends up stopping at a small service station. Still on the phone, and frantically distracted, he uses the toilet. But when he tries to leave, he finds the door jammed. He shouts for help, but no-one comes. There’s not a soul to be seen. Flavio Bretagna is alone, trapped in the toilet of a remote service station without the slightest idea of where he is. Outside, life goes on without him, both the work opportunity he was waiting for and the birthday of his daughter with whom he was hoping to reconnect... Time goes by, but his situation remains unchanged. Will Flavio manage to avoid losing everything?",
