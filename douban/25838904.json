    "introduction": "ACTS OF VIOLENCE is a behind the scenes documentary, structured in a scene by scene breakdown of all the incidents of violence in David Cronenberg's film, A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. Directed by Cronenberg's wife, Carolyn Zeifman, who has been married to her subject for more than 26 years, it provides a new insight on the filmmaker -- reputed over the years to be the king of cinematic depravity because of his exploration of graphically violent and sexual themes. The documentary chronicles the easy-going, familial mood that the long time, loyal crew have long attested pervades a Cronenberg set, as well as the many unique challenges of the production and explores the film's many themes of violence, especially in America.",
