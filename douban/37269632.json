    "introduction": "According to some sources of Ancient Greek and Roman historiography, the “mythical” Amazon Female Warriors originated in Pontus, a location which is today a part of Turkey’s Black Sea Region. Inspired and compiled from the texts of “History” by Herodotus, “Iliad” by Homer, “Promotheus Bound” by Aesychylus ,\"Argonautica” by Appollonius Rhodius, “Library of History” by Diodorus of Sicily, “The Fall of Troy” by Quintus of Smyrna, “The Gothic History” by Jordanes, “Geography” by Strabo and “Hippocratic Collection” by BC Pseudo-Hippocrates, the film ANDROKTONES retells the Amazons Female Warrior myths in the Turkish language, through the contradicting words of a female and male narrator. Set in a touristic Amazon theme park built in the Turkish Black Sea city of Samsun, ANDROKTONES takes a plunge at how the historical legacy of the Amazons is still very much subjective, and how the suffocating patriarchal voice defies time, language or geography. ×",
