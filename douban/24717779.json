    "introduction": "“Still Life: A Three Pines Mystery” takes place in the fictional village of Three Pines, a refuge from the fast-paced modern world in Quebec’s beautiful Eastern Townships.  It’s Thanksgiving weekend, and things appear as tranquil as ever. But not for long. This peaceful Eden is about to be disturbed by the discovery that a much- loved member of the community lies dead in the woods. The villagers are certain it’s nothing more than a tragic hunting accident but Inspector Armand Gamache (Nathaniel Parker) of the Québec police force suspects something rancid lays beneath the idyllic surface of the community.  As Gamache and his deputy Jean-Guy Beauvoir (Anthony Lemke) dig, they uncover layers of deceit, rage and long-simmering resentments. Armand Gamache knows something dark is buried in this pretty village and if they dig deep enough, Three Pines will begin to give up its secrets and a murderer will be exposed.“Still Life: A Three Pines Mystery” is based on Louise Penny’s novel and is the first installment of the Chief Inspector Armand Gamache murder mystery series.",
