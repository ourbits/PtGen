    "introduction": "With his naïve air, his rangy and reassuring silhouette, the first one symbolizes success, someone who everybody wants to look like. When they shared the poster of the 'Big sleep' in 1978, those who so well represented America during more than a half-century did not suspect that they would leave together for an eternal rest in 1997. The second, behind his legendary nonchalance, is a figure of bad boy, kind-hearted hooligan that we would like to have for accomplice. For the occasion of the 20th anniversary of their disappearances, Gregory Monro wonders what is the legacy left by these two big myths of the Hollywood cinema that are James Stewart and Robert Mitchum and in which way they fed the American dream ?",
