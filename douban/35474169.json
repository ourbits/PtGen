    "introduction": "Like a premonition or a threat, birds of prey fly over Rosillas. Below, among the men, resentment grows—the drought gives no respite, and the corruption and greed of the ones from above has left Gregorios lands without any water. There, nothing grows, and even his only cow is gone. In spite of his demands, there is a silence in the community that could be the result of inertia or resignation. Neither his son nor a possible new love seem able to give him hope for a future. At every turn, Gregorio plunges more and more into obsession, and the violence that dwells in the town becomes more palpable by the day. Rooted in an omnipresent space that is at once witness, mirror and reason in regards to the social conflicts the main characters go through, and with a dry tone and some visuals that give it a western-like feel, The Ones from Below builds a precise geographical metaphor in order to give shape to inequality",
