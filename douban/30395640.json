    "introduction": "In his first long documentary, award-winning German actor Charly Hübner follows Jan „Monchi” Gorkow and his band Feine Sahne Fischfilet over the course of three years. Gorkow, a one-time football hooligan, then a punk and anti-fascist activist, has become a prominent voice against anti-Semitism, racism, and homophobia. His band plays in front of tens of thousands of fans at Germany’s biggest festivals. However, it has also been monitored by Germany’s domestic intelligence agency for alleged subversive activities. With the rise of right-wing populism, this intense and personal portrait has become alarmingly timely: Only recently, after the documentary had been finished, the band was headlining concerts to counter violence and xenophobia in Saxony.",
