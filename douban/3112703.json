    "introduction": "七十年代的巴西CULT片大师José Mojica Marins的杰作之一，也是他以“Ze do Caixao”的名字为角色演出的影片，尽管并没有算进他最著名的“Coffin Joe”三部曲，鬼异程度却一点也不亚于其中任何一部。本片至今未出版DVD，能看到的只有带英文字幕的VHS版在市面上流通。José Mojica Marins, a director of horror films about the diabolical Coffin Joe, is spending Christmas with friends. Household members go violently mad for no reason: first grandpa, then the hosts' daughters, one of whom, Vilma, is about to get married. Mojica discovers that Vilma's mother made a pact with a witch in order to become pregnant with Vilma, promising this first-born child to Satan; her impending marriage to a human is stirring up things supernatural. It what seems like a dream, Mojica enters a bacchanal in which an entranced Vilma is about to wed to Satan's son; the master of ceremonies is none other than Coffin Joe. Can Mojica defeat his own creation and save Vilma?A very eerie movie at times, but still quite amusing at times. Some reporters wonder why director Marins does not believe in his own fictional character, Coffin Joe (alias Ze Do Caixao). After the interview he goes to visit his friend for christmas, and study some ideas for his new upcoming movie, \"The Demon Exorcist\". But there are some strange stuff going on in his friend's cabin. Tarantulas in christmas tree, people going berserk, and shouting some strange crap. We all know whats coming, because in the neightbourhood, in a wicked witch's wall, there's a picture of who else, than Coffin Joe! Don't miss the end, which is certainly NC-17 stuff, for both, the gore and the nudity. The musical score is eerie and chilling too.The Bloody Exorcism of Coffin Joe (original title O Exorcismo Negro) is a 1974 Brazilian horror film by Brazilian film director José Mojica Marins. Marins is also known by his alter ego Zé do Caixao (in English, Coffin Joe). It is one of several Marins' films that feature Coffin Joe as a major character, although it is not considered part of the \"Coffin Joe trilogy\" (At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul, This Night I Will Possess Your Corpse, and Embodiment of Evil).Filmed in Marins' trademark b movie style well known with his fans, including the use of inconsistent visual and sound editing, a bizarre audio track, and extremely low budget effects.",
