One day, some barmaids appear in town but they regard the lumbermen with contempt and look down on them, even though they are Koreans, too. Jeon Chang-geun, a young man of the town, persuades the women to live in harmony with the rest of them. To set an example, he marries one of the barmaids. Gradually, the barmaids find themselves joining the immigrants' lives.",
