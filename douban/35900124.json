    "introduction": "Since his first appearance in Ivan Sen’s feature Mystery Road (SFF 2013), and its follow-up Goldstone (SFF 2016), Jay Swan’s story has flourished on the small screen – although it continues to relish its cinematic roots. In the latest iteration, it’s 1999 and Constable Jay Swan, a charismatic young officer arrives at his new station in a town called Jardine. Fresh from the city and tipped for big things, Jay might be the new copper, but he’s not new to this town. His estranged father Jack lives here, as does the woman who will change his life forever, Mary. Directed by Dylan River (Buckskin, SFF 2013), and featuring Mark Coles Smith as young Jay Swan, alongside an impressive line-up of talent both fresh and renowned.",
