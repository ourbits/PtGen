    "introduction": "Based on the 1933 O Henry Award winning short story by Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, \"Gal Young 'Un\" is as close to an honest and loving treatment of backwoods Florida c.1930 as you will ever see. Victor Nunez, a Florida native, has spent his career interpreting Florida's varied and little known histories and places through film. \"A Flash of Green,\" \"Ruby in Paradise,\" and \"Ulee's Gold\" all followed from this masterful director after his early days with \"Gal Young 'Un.\" Partially financed with a state arts grant associated with the US Bicentennial in 1976, Nunez had few dollars but unlimited insight for the characters and for Rawlings, and that's what makes it a great film. Mattie is a widow living alone in the Florida pine woods. She has money, but never goes to town, never sees others, simply goes about her day has she had when her husband was alive. Along comes Trax, a smooth talking minor player in the bootleg business with high hopes of being a player. The story that follows includes some of the richest characters you'll ever see, including the gal young 'un that Trax brings home to Mattie's house.",
