    "introduction": "Nona is a dark surrealist romance told across genres, set in one night, from dusk to dawn, on the border between dream and waking. Nikola, as every night, cannot sleep due to his burdened subconscious. Tonight, moreover, there is a severe storm. The lightning causes a rip in reality, which is forfeited by a strange girl right on his balcony. Rational, systematic Nikola doesn't understand where she came from. She claims she fell from outer space and until she returns there, chaos will rule the Earth. A tired Nikola wants to help the confused girl, so she finds herself in a keyless robe in a city where people have disappeared and only Nona understands what's going on. Nikola is hesitant to believe promises that if he helps her, order will be restored.",
