    "introduction": "Ellie’s Eye is an essay-video comprising found and original footage. Ellie is the name of an AI therapist in development at the time of writing, as well as the name of one of the dogs featured in the work. Dogs and AI avatars are similar in that both are dependent on humans. Ellie's Eye examines how technologies invented for medical treatment relate to the human desire to see through, and into—such as x-rays, through-wall movement sensing, and AI-assisted psychotherapy. In the process, the work intertwines facts and fiction about the eye, eyesight, and the act of seeing. Medical scans and image technologies, tools that produce evidence of physical health or the lack thereof, have made rapid progress in the recent past; meanwhile, technologies for mental diagnosis are also developing at a similarly fast pace. This work interrogates how future societies and technologies can approach psychological issues of different individuals, and whether we are objectifying the human psyche itself.",
