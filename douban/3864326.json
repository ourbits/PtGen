    "introduction": "The judge Marco Serra (Cristea Avram) is resolving a bleak case of rape towards a teen-ager. The guilty one, the elderly hydraulic Mariani (Piero Mazzarella), defends himself accusing the minor and all teen-agers behaviour. An ignoble situation. The judge ascertains that immorality is so diffused indeed as Mariani says: in fact, first a contemporary of his daughter Mirella (Romy Schell) covets him, then the presumed victim of the hydraulic too. Marco Serra strengthens his beliefs when he discovers that Mirella belongs to a subversive association and she has participated in a beating. Finally, the last disappointment: Laura, his wife, betrays him with a pilot. Discovering the two lovers set apart in a car, the judge runs over the two lovers with his car, dying with them in the fire of the two vehicles. 'Il Giudice e la minorenne' (The judge and the under age girl...literally), is a film erotically morbid with an immoral plot from the beginning to the end, authentic and symbolic element of the Italian and European transformation in the society during the 1970's. BCULT Australian tape is 93' longer, soundtrack is by Franco and Mino Reitano (very famous Italian pop-singer), shot in Cinescope Technicolor format, Oscar Production and theatrical release was by Alpherat.",
