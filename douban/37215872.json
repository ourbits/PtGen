    "introduction": "Saturday. Gameday. A Saar-Palatinate football derby keeps all the emergency services in Saarbrücken in suspense, including the chief inspectors Leo Holz, Adam Schürk, Esther Baumann and Pia Heinrich. Because after the game, a death is reported from the emergency room. Andreas Schneider collapsed in the emergency room with skull fractures and a stab wound and could not be saved. It quickly turns out that he spent the \"third half\" in a field match. But whether he also suffered the fatal injuries there remains unclear for the time being. As hostile as the hooligan groups are, they all agree that the biggest and common enemy is the police. Therefore, they confront the Saarbrücken team with silence and clarify their fights among themselves. Adam Schürk also conceals certain truths. However, when he is mugged at home because someone is looking for the millions from his father's bank robbery, he has to let Leo Bäumer know.—ADR Das Erste",
