    "introduction": "A group of high school girls has a chat on the street. When they are shown in slow-motion, their conversation becomes mute to the audience. What are they thinking and talking about in these silent moments? Unlike many other films that focus on the clich? of psychologically traumatic memories from young adulthood, Highschoolgirls is a rare film of a group of lively teen girls that tries to capture a moment of female adolescence as a memory to cherish, not to evoke traumatic ones that you wish never to revisit.
