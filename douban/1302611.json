    "introduction": "American-born Agnes Keith (Colbert) and her British husband Harry Keith (Patric Knowles) live a cushioned colonial life in North Borneo with their young son George in 1942. Keith is the only American in Sandakan. Worried about the rumors surrounding Japanese invasion, Harry asks Agnes if she would leave for the United States along with George. Agnes replies that she would sent George but not go herself. In the meantime, the Pearl Harbor attack takes place. Japanese soldiers led by Colonel Suga (Sessue Hayakawa) capture the place. Suga is fluent in English and has read a book on Borneo authored by Mrs. Keith. During the Japanese invasion of Sandakan, Agnes has a miscarriage. Europeans living there are moved to prison camps. Harry lives in the camp meant for men while George and Agnes live in another camp. After a few days, women and children are taken to another camp.When Col. Suga is made in-charge of all the camps in the region he visits the one where Agnes lives and asks her to autograph a book's copy he had obtained from her house. Agnes does so. The camp guards are very cruel and oppressive. This is seen when they shoot a group of Australian men who tried to cross the wire fences. One of them attacks Agnes and she complains to Suga, who then asks Lieutenant Nekata to investigate in the matter. However, Agnes is not able to identify her assailant. Nekata again asks her to identify the assailant and after Agnes fails to do so he gives her a document to sign. She refuses to do so and is therefore tortured. In 1945 Japan surrenders and Suga's family dies in the Hiroshima bombing. He is arrested by Australian soldiers and the Keith family finally reunites.",
