    "introduction": "\"Choke\" starts out promising. A Wealthy businessman (Hopper) discovers his daughter was the culprit in a hit and run accident. Rather than report it, they decide to stay quiet, because she was drinking at the time. Little does he know, someone overheard. Blackmailing into taking a job he didn't at first want to, Hopper then decides it's easier if he just knocks off the man - and before you can say \"cover up\" - a body is pushed out a second story window. Enter, Madsen, as a strange man, who drives up in a classic car, claiming to have seen Hopper's act. Instead of turning him into the authorities though - Madsen asks Hopper into his car and together they go cruising on the highways, stopping (constantly) to talk about their evil deeds.It's this \"stopping and starting\", that causes \"Choke\" to crumble. At times, it's as if we are watching a home video of a couple of actors talking (most of the time about nothing in particular), forgetting that they are supposed to be entertaining the audience. For Madsen and Hopper fans only.",
