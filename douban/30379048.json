    "introduction": "At the height of the Roaring Twenties, music scouts armed with cutting-edge recording technology set out across America to capture the unknown voices of everyday folk. The recordings they made captured the country's diversity - artistically, ethnically, geographically, and economically. As told by music pioneers, their families and eyewitnesses to the era, we travel back in time to the 'Big Bang' of modern popular music, to the first time America heard itself. Everyday Americans heard their own music for the very first time, pure and unadulterated-this was a democratic revolution that would reverberate around the world.",
