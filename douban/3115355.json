    "introduction": "Jan is by far the most unpopular employee at work, not surprisingly considering how badly he treats his co-workers. But that treatment is nothing compared to the one he receives himself when he goes home at night to his wife, the hot-tempered Bente. The marriage is on the verge of a breakdown when Jan’s boss finally sends him into group therapy. There an unlikely friendship emerges between Jan and the two mechanics, Rudy and Alf. Had Jan only known that Alf loved opera, and had Bente known what Rudy and Alf were up to, they would never have let them into their home. On the corner of chance and destiny, their lives take unexpected turns.Paprika Steen is probably best known for her acting in films such as The Idiots, Celebration, and Mifunes Last Song. She has received several awards for her acting both internationally and at home. Til døden os skiller is the second film she has directed.\"",
