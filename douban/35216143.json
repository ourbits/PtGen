    "introduction": "Cory Mathis (Les Stroud), a respected college professor, claims a mythical forest creature killed his wife transforming him into a man haunted by obsession and revenge. He partners up with legendary Big Foot hunter Fran Andersen (Stacy Brown Jr.) who is out to collect the Nat Geo 10 million dollar bounty for capture of the creature. Unfortunately, by-the-book forest ranger, Billy Teal (Tom Green), a covert government agency and a serial hoaxer (Rick Dyer) have other plans. A dark and witty comedy with a dysfunctional protagonist, a twisted narrative, and a series of events that builds into a shocker of an ending. The Canadian duo of Tom Green and Les Stroud hit it out of the forest.",
