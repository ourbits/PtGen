    "introduction": "根据阿根廷当代魔幻现实主义小说家Eduardo Gudino Kieffer的同名作改编成的电影，故事来自一个古老的南美传说，鸟人与无家可归的少女。导演Rodolfo Kuhn是阿根廷新浪潮电影中GLAUBER ROCHA式的人物，而影片的镜头上也与罗查的《痛苦的大地》有相近。可惜在当时阿根廷动荡不安的社会背景下这片没引起注意，不过今天看来它无疑是那个时代阿根廷电影中最有创造力的作品之一。Maria is a restless but humble young woman who violates a strong taboo of her province of Corrientes in northern Argentina and leaves her home while the sun is high in the sky. She then finds herself being seduced by the Yatsi Terere, the mythological bird-become-man who exists solely for punishing girls who violate the taboo.Eduardo Gudino Kieffer (November 2, 1935 -- September 20, 2002) was an Argentine writer, born in Esperanza, Santa Fe. He was part of the latin american literature boom of the 1960s. He graduated as a lawyer but never practiced law. He wrote novels, essays, short stories, children's books, scripts and theatre plays. He was also a renowned jornalist. His books have been translated to many languages (English language, French language, Portuguese language, Dutch language and Polish language, among others). He was also part of the jury in many literary contests. Because of his works, mainly about Buenos Aires, and thanks to the support of countless friends, he was named \"Ciudadano Ilustre de la Ciudad\" (Distinguished Citizen of Buenos Aires). He was married and divorced and had three children: Florencio, Nicolas and Agustin. None of them is a writer. He died in Buenos Aires in 2002.",
