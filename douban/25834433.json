Filmed at Owens Funeral Home in New York City's historic Harlem neighborhood, HOMEGOINGS takes an up-close look at the rarely seen world of undertaking in the black community, where funeral rites draw on a rich palette of tradition, history and celebration. Combining cinéma vérité with intimate interviews and archival photographs, the film paints a portrait of the dearly departed, their grieving families and a man who sends our loved ones \"home.\"",
