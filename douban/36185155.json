    "introduction": "Czech Swan is a humorous and uplifting story about a group of elderly women from a small Czech village, whose age doesn't stop them from pursuing their dreams and caprices with unbeatable enthusiasm. Hanna and her eleven friends are members of a locally famous dancing group Majorettes, with only two years left before they can celebrate its 15th anniversary. To overcome temporary crisis of popularity, they decide to incorporate Tchaikovsky's classic Swan Lake into their Majorette dancing routine with the help of the director of Ostrava National Ballet and his debuting prima ballerina.",
