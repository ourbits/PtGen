However, Jimmy must hire an openly gay leading man or the series will not go forward. Jimmy casts sexy, talented Sam Decker...except Sam is secretly straight! To keep their show on the air, Jimmy and Sam must conspire to convince the network that they are a gay couple. From here on out, Sam is publicly an out man as he, Jimmy, a pool boy, a diva maid wannabe actress, the network president and his nanny/receptionist struggle every week to make a new television show...and in the process, a new family.",
