    "introduction": "Α found footage film about oral rituals (…), about seasonal celebrations, and about a married couple, who quite obviously understand how to enrich and enliven companionship. We see a pair pouring drinks, cutting cakes, drinking toasts...(Bert Rebhandl). I wanted to bestow the couple a dignified resurrection and organized the footage so that, temporally speaking, the material runs in reverse and the players are steadily rejuvenated. (…) The finale is reached with the woman’s spirited dance that culminates in a freeze-frame, her face expressing an equal measure of joy and pain. Between egg-nog and Sachertorte, the vanity of human existence rears its head. Ultimately Happy-End is a tragicomedy.
