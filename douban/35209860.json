    "introduction": "New York-based film director Maria Beatty has produced award-winning films since the 1990s, which, with playful joy, commute between pain and enjoyment. Beatty takes fetish, S/M and lesbian aesthetics to a higher level, through dramatic lighting, high production quality and natural actors. Her films reside both visually and thematically in a shadow country where women's erotic desire to be dominated by another woman is realized. Written by Ulf Kjell Gür",
