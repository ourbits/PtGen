    "introduction": "Budd Boetticher's final release is an independently produced documentary about legendary bullfighter Carlos Arruza, narrated by Anthony Quinn. A film he spent much time, effort and money on and was to be his masterpiece, perhaps his most personal. Boetticher himself had been a bullfighter before going into movies. Tragically, a car accident on May 20th, 1966 took the lives of Carlos Arruza and some of Boetticher's filming crew. Boetticher completed the film and only directed one other, A Time for Dying (1969). Arruza was released in 1972 to strong reviews but flopped in the theaters.",
