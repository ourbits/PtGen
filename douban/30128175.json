    "introduction": "The Winter Wishes Festival is finally coming and all of the ponies in Ponyville are excited to see Twinkle Wish, a wishing star who grants each pony one special wish. However, after Twinkle Wish gets kidnapped by a dragon named Whimsey Weatherbe, the entire event is facing a big dilemma and it's up to Pinkie Pie and her friends to get her back before the night of the festival. Otherwise, everyone's wishes won't be granted, and the festival would be ruined.At the end of the film, it turns out that Whimsey simply wanted Twinkle Wish as a companion to play with, rather than intending any harm on her. After Pinkie and her friends fail to convince Whimsey to give her back, the dragon has a change of heart and gives Twinkle Wish back to them, just in time for the festival. Everyone's wishes are granted in the process and the festival gets to happen after all, to everybody's happiness.",
