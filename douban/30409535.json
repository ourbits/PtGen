Schulman will produce via her Welle Entertainment with Gaspin and Tony Sabistina through Gaspin Media. Schulman and Gaspin are preparing to take the project to potential buyers immediately.Real-life husband and wife authors Miller and Feifer served as inspiration for the dramedy. It centers on Carmen and Lucas, a pair of magazine writers who unknowingly work for the same publication when they have a one-night stand. Their subsequent individual reviews of the encounter go viral, so they decide to continue the relationship and write weekly dueling columns reviewing each other’s performance in bed.",
