    "introduction": "The French-Peruvian artist Rose Lowder has been developing a unique oeuvre of structural films since the 1970s. Her works, comprised of elaborate 16mm frame-by-frame compositions, are mainly dedicated to botanical and landscape-related motifs and beguile the viewers through a trance-like rhythm. In La Source de la Loire, Lowder explores the course and source of the river Loire in France's South-East.",
