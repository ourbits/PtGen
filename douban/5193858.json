    "introduction": "A compelling story of trials, tragedy, success, and love unfolds in Lupin. With sleek and luxurious sports cars, vehicles, and sets, breath-taking and action-packed scenes, and swoon-worthy romance, Lupin would surely beguile viewers and get pulses racing. Witness the adventures of a young man trapped in his past whom love has yet to free. Lupin's compelling misadventures begin when his rich businessman father is found dead; his father's best friend, a former thief who is now also a businessman, is the primary suspect. Cecilia Lupin is able to escape with her young son, but they're separated along the way. While Cecilia is believed to be dead, young Lupin is found by Duroy who raises him but teaches him how to steal. The only heir to the wealth of his late father, Andre Lupin will grow up to become the best thief in town, known as Lupin de Dios. He has quick hands and reflexes, but he thinks even more quickly, and while he is only a high-school graduate, he is extremely intelligent. A business tycoon by day and a master thief by night, this playboy uses wit and charm as his weapons. Lupin has three sidekicks who help him in heists: Ashley, a military school graduate who is a sharp-shooter and mistress of disguise whose lethal beauty is unrivaled; Brigette, his lookout, a computer-college dropout who at least honed her hacking skills while she was a student and who is skilled in using knives as weapons; and Castor, known as the King of Small Time Con, who used to be Lupin's nemesis. Meanwhile, two women will capture Lupin's heart: Angeli Villavicer, for whom Lupin turns his back on his dark life as a thief but a tragedy would disrupt their wedding day; and Avril Legarda, the orphaned daughter and sole heir of the rich businessman who was killed.",
