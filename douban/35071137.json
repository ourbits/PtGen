    "introduction": "Six campers brave the outdoor elements for a once in a lifetime opportunity - to perfect their baking skills under the watchful eye of baking mentor Martha Stewart, host Jesse Palmer and camp counselors and baking experts Carla Hall and Dan Langan. Each episode the bakers are lead through challenges that test their skills over two rounds, with the most impressive baker of the first heat getting a personal one-on-one mentoring session with their idol, Martha, in her home kitchen. Equal parts baking boot-camp and camp-inspired games and challenges, the baker that displays the least amount of progress at the end of each episode will pack their bags and head home, with the last camper standing winning a kitchen filled with appliances worth $25,000.",
