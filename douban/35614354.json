    "introduction": "The dramatic, true story of C.S. Lewis' journey from committed atheist to reluctant believer begins with his turbulent childhood. After losing his mother to cancer and becoming estranged from his father, a young C.S. Lewis deems existence bleak and unfortunate. His tutelage under atheist William T. Kirkpatrick and his harrowing experiences in The Great War solidify his case for materialism until he befriends J.R.R. Tolkien and Hugo Dyson. His fellow intellectuals-all Christians-challenge him to consider the logical, mythological, and literary cases for Christianity, and Lewis must face a life-altering choice: to hold fast to materialism or to give his life to Jesus Christ.",
