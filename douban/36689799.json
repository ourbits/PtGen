    "introduction": "The three-part series looks back at one of the most seismic events in British royal history. In 1649, for the first and only time, a British monarch was publicly executed, having been tried and convicted of treason by Parliament. This bloody spectacle heralded 10 years of Britain as a republic before, in May 1660, the monarchy was restored with the accession of King Charles II. Told through dramatic reconstruction, Atim for the Royalists, Harris for the Regicides, and Fiennes for King Charles II will play out the Jacobean tragedy, coming a few months after the coronation of King Charles III.",
