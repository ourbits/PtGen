    "introduction": "A film about the desire for happiness, based on the play by Franca Rame and Dario Fo. For years now, the highly-regarded actress and author Chiara Francini has brought The Open Couple to the stage. This timeless fairy tale or inferno, as the case may be, looks at couples in love, and love beyond couples. That’s the story of Antonia, whose husband proposes an open marriage. She only agrees so she won’t lose him, but everything changes as soon as she starts to investigate her feelings and peer out over her living-room couch. Chiara/Antonia, now torn between her husband Fredrik and her partner-in-crime and on-stage, Alessandro, resolves to explore a world born of the open couples of the ‘70s, a world of polyamory, the young and not-so-young who are “against” monogamy, feminists, and sex-positive parties. She delves into her own soul, her life and loves filled with questions, doubt, laughter and the certainties we desperately hold on to, as a way to rein ourselves in.",
