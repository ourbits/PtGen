Beat Kings chronicles the history of beatmaking from the days of Afrika Bambatta to Marley Marl to modern day greats like Kanye West. Tapping a who's who in hip hop music, Beat Kings get the first hand accounts of the equipment they use, how they learned to make beats, and anything else a budding producer or hip hop fan would want to know. The DVD features in the studio interviews with Kanye West, Just Blaze, Havoc (Mobb Deep), Trackmasters, Swiss Beats, RZA, Premier, Pete Rock, Marley Marl, Alchemist, Easy Moe Bee, Prince Paul and more. These producers are the architects behind the rhymes of superstars like Jay-Z, Notorious BIG, 50 Cent, Nas, The Wu-Tang Clan and now anyone can learn how they do it.",
