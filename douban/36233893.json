    "introduction": "The belief that there are no more white spots on Austria’s map is not quite right: In 1938 the German army established one of Europe’s largest military training grounds in northern Lower Austria. The over 160 square kilometers it covers is still restricted.Nikolaus Geyrhalter approaches this literally occupied territory from a variety of new directions: the choreography of daily drills, the people who live on the edge of this area, and those who were resettled many years ago. Dozens of plant and animal species now live in this area, apparently without being affected by the activity and noise.",
