    "introduction": "“Seeing 12,000 people listening live to something we worked so many years on with Mikolai Stroinski and Piotr Musiał — it’s magical; a beautiful culmination of the time we spent on scoring Geralt’s adventures,” says The Witcher 3 Music Director, Marcin Przybyłowicz. “With the concert now available through YouTube, gamers, fantasy fans, and music lovers can join us then and there, feel the emotions and excitement of those moments,” Przybyłowicz adds.Performing on the scene is the AUKSO Chamber Orchestra of the City of Tychy, the Pro Musica Mundi choir, folkmetal band Percival Schuttenbach and soloists — Wioletta Chodowicz (soprano), Rafał Grząka (accordion), Robert Jaworski (hurdy-gurdy, lute, bowed gusle) and Amir Yaghamai (master of Persian folk instruments). The concert was conducted by AUKSO founder and artistic director, Marek Moś. It also features a special arrangement of Lullaby of Woe, known from the trailer A night to remember, sung by alternative artist and winner of several Fryderyk awards — BRODKA.The Video Game Show — The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt concert was held during the 9th edition of Film Music Festival in Kraków and organized by CD PROJEKT RED in cooperation with Kraków Festival Office.The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt Suite00:00:30 - Geralt of Rivia00:01:50 - Eredin, King of the Hunt00:04:13 - Commanding the Fury00:06:23 - Wake Up, Ciri00:07:58 - The Wolf and the Swallow00:10:30 - Fate Calls00:12:29 - Farewell, Old Friend00:15:25 - Ladies of the Woods00:17:52 - Spikeroog00:20:56 - Bonny at Morn00:23:28 - On Thin Ice00:25:51 - Witch Hunters00:28:29 - The Tree We Sat Once00:31:05 - I Name Thee Dea and Embrace Thee as My Daughter00:32:23 - King's Bran Final Voyage00:34:35 - Welcome, Imlerith00:37:21 - The Hunt is Coming00:39:25 - Kaer Morhen00:41:57 - Aen Seidhe00:45:11 - Silver for Monsters00:47:22 - Geralt of Rivia (reprise)The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt — Hearts of Stone Suite00:50:05 - Hearts of Stone00:53:03 - Mystery Man00:55:40 - The Temple of Lilvani00:58:00 - A Gifted Man Brings Gifts GaloreThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt — Blood and Wine Suite01:02:20 - Blood and Wine01:05:20 - The Banks of the Sansretour01:09:18 - Fanfares and Flowers01:12:30 - Lady of the Lake01:13:42 - The Slopes of the Blessure01:15:58 - Beyond Hill and Dale...01:19:02 - The Moon Over Mount Gorgon01:21:04 - Tesham Mutna01:23:15 - Lullaby of Woe",
