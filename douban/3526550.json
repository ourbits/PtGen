    "introduction": "RAINBOW BRIDGE is a loose \"mystical voyage\" story built around Jimi Hendrix's final concert performance at Rainbow Bridge, Hawaii. Not merely a concert film, however, the fictional drama spends most of its time following actress Pat Hartley, who travels to Hawaii and absorbs the local counter-cultural community firsthand. The film culminates in Hendrix's performance atop the enormous Haleakala Volcano, where fans are treated to yet another dazzling display of guitar virtuosity. Tragically, Hendrix died only months after shooting this concert, adding to the film's historical allure. Including such hits as \"Purple Haze,\" \"Foxy Lady,\" \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" and more, RAINBOW BRIDGE is yet another testament to the genius of Jimi Hendrix.",
