    "introduction": "Stretching almost 5000 km over international borders, reaching thousands of feet into the sky, splitting the continents -- The Rocky Mountains are more than just massive, they're monstrous. Wild Rockies takes you into some of the unique ecosystems across this sprawling mountain range, and introduces you to the animals that call them home. From wild horses in the desert-like Okanagan valley, to grizzly bears batting salmon out of the glacier-fed rivers, and even mountain goats stomping around way up near the peaks, where even trees can't survive. Wild Rockies will tell the stories of these incredible creatures living among the peaks and valleys of one of the world's most iconic mountain ranges.",
