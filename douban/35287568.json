    "introduction": "The film is divided into three episodes, linked together by a special newscast. The news is led by Emilio Fede, to the last live television broadcast of his career. Fede launches the three episodes as if they were services of the news. The first episode tells the story of Walter, who is in charge of the lifeguards in a beach establishment in Jesolo. Walter is a person full of charm, but at the same time unreliable and addicted to gambling. In the second episode, Adriano, a true Roman of middle age, is the owner of a luxurious hotel in Padua. Business is bad and often the man is forced, together with his wife Maria, to resort to more or less legal expedients to get by. In the last episode, Monica is a young choreographer who teaches in a suburban dance school. The owners of the school, tired of the few takings, decide to close their doors by giving three months' notice. Monica, together with her students, looks for a solution.",
