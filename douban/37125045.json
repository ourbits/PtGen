    "introduction": "An episode of PBS SoCal’s Emmy Award-winning series Artbound, “Giant Robot: Asian Pop Culture and Beyond” is an insider look at the history and influence of the magazine from its earliest days. Interviews with founder Eric Nakamura along with Martin Wong (co-editor), Margaret Cho, Daniel Wu, David Choe, Claudine Ko (culture editor) and Wendy Lau (graphic designer) capture the DIY, punk-infused spirit that fueled its coverage of Asian and Asian American alternative culture as well as its distinctive, innovate look. Insightful and inspiring, the episode will be followed by an in-person conversation with many of its subjects.",
