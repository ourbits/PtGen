    "introduction": "过山车一般惊心动魄的赛季。一整个赛季的精彩比赛，美妙的进球和难以置信的结果，枪手们超越邻居热刺夺得英超第三名，虽然没有夺冠，但在伦敦仍然是最好的俱乐部。这意味着连续第15次打入欧冠，17年连续在积分榜上压倒热刺。在俱乐部125年的光辉历史上，也没有几个赛季比得上过去的这一年。It was the ultimate roller coaster campaign. A season of great games, glorious goals and unbelievable results that ended with the Gunners overtaking neighbours Spurs to claim third place and ensure their status as London s number one club. It means a 15th successive season qualifying for the Champions League and 17 years since Tottenham last finished above Arsenal. There have been few seasons like this in the club's proud 125 year history. A thrilling 5-3 win at Chelsea; a formidable 5-2 triumph over Tottenham; the magnificent 7-1 wonder show against Blackburn; and the heroic 3-0 victory over Milan. The feel good factor's back at Arsenal. Leading from the front has been captain fantastic Robin van Persie, smashing in 37 goals in all competitions many of them absolutely breathtaking. He topped it off with double Player of the Year awards, recognised as the best by both his fellow players and the football writers. Arsene Wenger has once again proved there is no one better at discovering exciting talent with England's newest whizz kid Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain bursting on to the scene. And there was even a blast from the past with legend Thierry Henry enjoying a second spell at the club, reminding everyone what a genius he is. Featuring every goal from every game. The perfect record of a landmark season that will live long in the memory of every Gooner.",
