    "introduction": "The shape of rotating wheels hypnotizes people. The history of the automotive industry is driven by different vehicles: cars, horse-drawn carriages, motorcycles, caravans, passenger cars, lorries, and racing cars. The same area is inhabited by birds, dogs, children and passers-by. Initially green, the area becomes grey because of the pollution. Moto-gas poisons the environment. White silhouettes of people darken with toxins. Finally, they disappear into a dirty stain. An animated film for adults by Kazimierz Urbanski, an animation theorist and practitioner, an organizer of artistic education in the field of animated film. He used animations to study matter in terms of possible movement encoded in it and artistic effects. Urbanski's films were not devoid of content. The issue of automotive industry links \"Moto-gas\" with The \"Charm of the Wheels\" (1966). Apart from cut-outs and the torn-paper technique, wet-surfaced paints were used in the animation. The music was composed by Andrzej Markowski, performed by Eugeniusz Rudnik from the Polish Radio Experimental Studio.",
