    "introduction": "“Punk under Communist regime” is a film about the Ljubljana punk scene between 1978 and 1985. The bands that were formed at that time were all made up of high school students who, despite their youth, quickly started performing and triggered a wave of repression by communist party structures. While Marshall Tito was dying in Ljubljana, young people's outburst of incredible creativity took place in Slovenia, who no longer agreed to the party's one-mindedness. They were the first blow of the counterculture in the socialistic state of Yugoslavia. The punk scene reached its peak in 1981 at the first New Rock concert, This was followed by a Nazi punk affair that brought the three protagonists of the scene into police custody. What is unique, in addition to the abundance of songs that are still",
