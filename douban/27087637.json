The two women are each sold to the country where they both try to escape to no success. Hye-ri's husband quits his job to look for his wife. He meets In-ae and finally, through the solidarity of an isolated group of prostitutes, they rescue his wife. He vows to live with and heal the wound that a sick society has dealt his wife. He feels that is the only way to reflect and be self-aware of the animal instinct of humans where all morality is lost.",
