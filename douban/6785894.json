    "introduction": "Eve Parker (Nicollette Sheridan), a driven and successful advertising executive from Los Angeles, is devastated when she finds out her fiancé, Greg (Patrick Baladi), has been cheating on her. Leaving Greg behind, Eve decides to go on their honeymoon alone—to a breathtaking castle in the Irish countryside that Greg’s company has just bought and plans to turn into a golf course. But Eve soon discovers the honeymoon suite isn’t so sweet when everything starts to go wrong, from her lost luggage to her repeated run-ins with the estate’s manager Sean (Greg Wise), a handsome outdoorsman with a knack for getting on her nerves. It is culture clash between the big city girl and a nature-loving Irishman, but soon things get even more confusing when Greg shows up to try to woo Eve back to the altar.",
