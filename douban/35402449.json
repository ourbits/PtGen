As the war in Vietnam raged, one of the largest and most successful youth-led resistance movements in American history was growing at home.Hundreds of thousands of young men opposed to an unjust war said NO to being drafted into the military, risking up to five years in federal prison. Their individual courage and collective nonviolent actions helped end a tragic war and the draft.",
