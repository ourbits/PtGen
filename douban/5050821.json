    "introduction": "A waiter (Amparo Munoz) with the personality of a house plant but not quite that intelligent, gets by on his good looks as he enjoys the favors of women. A duchess lands him a job as a gardener in the palatial spread of one of the ministers of Adolfo Suarez (Prime Minister in Spain at this time). The wife of the minister (impotent himself) seduces the mindless gardener, and apparently finds something lacking because then she goes after the minister's secretary. Unbeknownest to her, the gardener has just converted her into a budding mother. Meanwhile, terrorists decide to kidnap the gardener as a kind of bait (or practice run) for kidnapping the minister. Although it is not revealed until later, the secretary is in league with the terrorists, but then so is the minister. The whole lot of them, in fact, is really controlled by an international ring of corporate types promoting the use of nuclear energy. In brief, an impotent, secretly terrorist minister with a pregnant wife, stupid yet randy gardener, and lesbian, terrorist secretary is running part of the Spanish government, apparently about to be taken over by nuclear energy. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi",
