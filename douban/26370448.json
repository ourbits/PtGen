Living in a place that is invisible to the rest of the world, on the margins of society, on the border between illegality and anarchy, is a community which is suffering, trying to react to the threat of being forgotten by the institutions and having their very rights as citizens trampled over. Retired war veterans, uncommunicative teens, drug addicts looking for a way out of their addiction through love, former special forces soldiers still battling against the world, young women and mothers-to-be drifting through life, an older generation which has not yet lost the will to live.",
