On arriving she discovers that her boyfriend, Marc, has vanished hang-gliding over the ocean. She meets David, her boyfriend's roommate and archaeologist co-worker. As they search the coastal area a taboo but intense attraction develops - until Marc reappears, convincing Eryka that she has just woken up from a recurring post-trauma nightmare. Together with Marc and very much in love, Eryka dives fearlessly into a sweet death-bound dream.",
