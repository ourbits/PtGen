    "introduction": "Deaf gay parents Alan and Brian brought their hearing twin children home from India to NYC in 2011 after a ten-year long surrogacy process. While expanding their sign language teaching business and maneuvering their relationship, the couple are also coping with their increasingly rambunctious kids and the inherent communication issues, as the kids start shrieking \"you don't understand me\" to their fathers. \"LOUD Love\" is their story, a documentary about parenting, growth and its occasional hurdles.",
