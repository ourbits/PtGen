    "introduction": "The Chinese title, Nüshu, inspired by Helen Lai's choreographic piece under the same name, documented 9 different female choreographers' creative journeys from 2017 to 2020. It is also a comparison to the unique written language, literally translated as \"female writing\", developed over generations by peasant women in Jiangyong County, Hunan Province, practised only among women and remained unknown to the outside world until the 1960s. By incorporating writings of contemporary Hong Kong female writers, Bik-wan Wong and Xi Xi, the director reveals different female perspectives, gives them their voices and creates dialogues through dance.",
