    "introduction": "Set in Kyiv in the late 1990s, \"Forever-Forever\" is an unsettling portrait of the young and rebellious as they navigate love, explore their sexuality, and play cruel games with each other, where there is never a winner.After transferring from a downtown high school, Tonia (Alina Cheban) befriends a group of badass youngsters, trying to find protection from the people from her past and a place she truly belongs. They spend time together, roaming around Kyiv's post-socialist suburbs, having fun and getting in trouble. Soon, Tonia falls in love with Zhurik (played by Zachary Shadrin who was the first Ukrainian actor ever submitted for Emmy consideration, for his role in Apple TV series Little America). When she also falls for Sania (Arthur Aliiev), she finds herself tangled up in an alluring secret love triangle. But Tonia's painful past still haunts her, challenging this newfound friendship and romance. Will she be able to find her own pass or lose herself in this new controversial relationship? Set in Kyiv in the late 1990s, this is a story of the young and rebellious amid the ruins of the Soviet regime. Those who had to grow up faster due to the circumstances but got lost in the adult world. A story of which we need constant reminding, as some things only exist at the moment, while others last forever.",
