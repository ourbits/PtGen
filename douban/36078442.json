    "introduction": "Erin Moriarty returns to Tribeca with a flamethrower of a performance. Moriarty stars as Geena, an artist and painter ready to dream big, tired of the malaise of living in the harsh Big Bend desert with controlling partner Clyde (Jai Courtney). At her wit's end, Geena is preparing to leave when a new couple shows up at the commune in a trailer from New York, eager to make a new life for themselves away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Things quickly turn dangerous for both couples as tensions boil over; egos come to a head as attempts to connect leave everyone frayed and on the edge of disaster.In this fascinating look at how couples sustain relationships, even in the face of erosion and dismay, audiences will grapple with the friction of romantic pursuits and conflicting friendships as much as Geena and Clyde do in Stuart Gatt’s directorial debut.源自：https://www.tribecafilm.com/films/catching-dust-2023",
