    "introduction": "\"The Expectation of the Observed\" meditates on how much our bodies do not actually seem to belong to us. This experimental short considers the unrecognized labor in having and being a body. Puppets—disembodied meaty legs, flayed of skin—dance in repetition even as they start to disintegrate. Repeated stress falls on marginalized bodies as political symbols, performing for an expectant audience who is implicated in their watching.",
