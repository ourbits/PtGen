    "introduction": "This is a heartwarming little comedy from Israeli director Ephraim Kishon.Shaike Ophir plays Azulai, a Hulot-like character who is a bit too nice to be a proper policeman.While his friends have all gone onto the higher ranks of the force, Azulai has always been stuck where he is.In fact, he's only there due to his 'friends in high places' pity.This is mainly a comedy due to Azulai's antics but it's not all laughs.Recommended for any fan of Tati and alike.--zoneyoutwonk________________________________Born in Budapest, Hungary, as Ferenc Hoffmann, Ephraim Kishon studied sculpture and painting, and then began publishing humourous essays and writing for the stage. After 1945 he changed his surname from Hoffmann to Kishont. He emigrated to Israel in 1949, where an immigration officer gave him the name Ephraim Kishon.Acquiring a mastery of Hebrew with remarkable speed, he started a regular satirical column in the easy-Hebrew daily, Omer, after only two years in the country. From 1952, he wrote the column \"Had Gadya\" in the daily Ma'ariv. Devoted largely to political and social satire but including essays of pure humour, it became one of the most popular columns in the country. His extraordinary inventiveness, both in the use of language and the creation of character, was applied also to the writing of innumerable sketches for theatrical revues.Azulai is a soft-hearted and incompetent policeman in Jaffa. His superiors want to send him to early retirement, but he would like to stay on the force. The criminals of Jaffa who also don't want to see him leave try to find a way to help him keep his job.",
