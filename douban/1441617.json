From the fluid Aureole to the primal Cloven Kingdom and graceful Esplanade, Taylor has remained at the forefront of 20th century modern dance.\nOffering a rare glimpse inside the creative collaboration between the master and his hardworking troupe, Dancemaker chronicles the evolution of the fiery, tango-derived Piazzolla Caldera from its first tentative steps through its triumphant New York City premiere.\nFilled with magnificent archival footage from Taylor's early years as a featured dancer for the Martha Graham Dance Company, and inspired performances from his troupe, Dancemaker is a unique exploration of the mysteries of creative life, the obsession and talent of the dancers, and the mind of an artistic genius.",
