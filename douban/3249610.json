    "introduction": "A famous film star is put under an anesthetic after an attempted suicide and relives her melodramatic past. Written by Anonymous---------------------------------------------Gaby Doriot's new popular song \"La signora di tutti\" will be a hit in France, so her manager is negotiating a new contract with her film production company... The movie studio is bustling, but Gaby is nowhere to be found. Her manager checks her hotel, finding her on the bathroom floor: an apparent suicide attempt. At the hospital, as the anaesthetic is applied, Gaby flashes back to her life back home in Milan... At school, Gaby's affair with a married teacher gets her expelled. She and her sister Anna are invited to a party by Roberto, the son of a well-to-do banker. He and Gaby plan to go to Rome together, but his father's unexpected return sends him off alone. Gaby is on very good terms with Roberto's invalid mother, but his father, Leonardo, is drawn to Gaby... Written by David Carless",
