    "introduction": "Tuk Tuk Eye is a film that documents the stories of protestors from different backgrounds and ages, that summarise the popular movement against corruption known as the October Revolution. The revolutionary journey starts in Tahrir Square, a place in Baghdad that stands for the demand for freedom and the defeat of injustice. The main character of the film is Tahrir Square and from there, ten short stories are revealed. Stories that complement each other, forming one. All inspired by the history of the monument on the Square. The focus remains on the background of the people and how they began revolting against pain and corruption. The October Revolution that took place in Iraq in 2019 is our starting point. The film aims to portray the motivations and purposes of the demonstrators and the events that are neglected by mass media.",
