    "introduction": "Claire and Kevin both attend a French village school. They are in the same class, CE2, for children aged eight and nine. Claire is the target of constant bullying by Kevin and his friends, and this is even starting to get violent. It seems very difficult to do anything about it – reporting it to the teacher or parents often backfires. When her mother finally takes action, it becomes clear that Kevin is facing a complicated, unsafe situation at home. Against all expectations, a friendship arises between the two children, and their two families come to understand one another better.In this realistic drama, veteran filmmaker Jacques Doillon tells a recognisable story from changing perspectives, but always from the children’s viewpoints. This leads the young actors to exceptional performances – from the at times grim scenes in the playground and narrow streets, to the complex interaction with parents who are hardly able to keep their own lives on the rails.",
