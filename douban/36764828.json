    "introduction": "The film does look set to be incredibly personal: when Elisa realises that the film she’s been working on for years is dead, it impacts everything in her life, including her faith. She wanted to talk about her conversion to Catholicism, but maybe she wasn’t enough of a believer? \"In God or in the film?\", we ask ourselves, but not even she can answer this question. When faced with failure, all she’s ever been able to do is lose herself. \"Because you’re tedious and you don’t know how to look after other people\", the Madonna tells her the first time they speak, desacralizing her crisis and inciting her to react. As a result, Elisa, her sister, her screenwriter and the failed film’s lead actor set off on a journey on board a ship, headed for a sanctuary which they know little to nothing about. Each of them has something to resolve, a knot to untie, much like all the other pilgrims on the boat.",
