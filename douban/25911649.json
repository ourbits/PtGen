Thuwaiwanjak Phuttan, Darika’s best friend, has to go on a business trip for his job. He asked her to look after his condo.

In addition, the condo is close to her work place which is even more convenient for her. She can save money from traveling expenses and use it for other things. Darika really loves her job because she gets paid well. It makes her happy to be able to fend for herself and not rely on a man.Darika doesn’t take interest in men because she’s afraid that she will experience a failed marriage like her mother’s.
