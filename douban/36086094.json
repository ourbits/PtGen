We see them in their daily lives: sharing meals, doing homework and even dancing.Until one night Julian can't take it anymore and brings his mother back to reality, begging her to end her insane fantasy. Valeria hasn't been with them for two months. She was the victim of a femicide. The night she went out, she never came back.\"I'm not saying that it doesn't hurt, mom, I know it hurts, a lot, every day, I'm just saying that you do something different with your pain,\" Julian tells his mom.And from that moment on, Nadia will no longer be able to escape her reality. Her daughter is gone, her room is empty, and the dining table no longer has three places, but only two. And this is how we get to the last scene of this story: Nadia decides to do something with her pain and joins the “Las Vigilantas” (The vigilants).",
