    "introduction": "This isn’t exactly a biopic about the very famous humorist and lord of prank calls; it’s a film about Jorge, a somehow clumsy and shy office worker, who stutters when speaking in public and doesn't know how to approach the girl he likes. But Jorge is also, as those who know him are truly aware, a loyal, very funny friend. And when one day, a bit by chance, he ends up being the object of a hypnosis session, he discovers that he has a new ability—that of grabbing a phone and turning into the irreverent Doctor Tangalanga in order to amuse those in need of amusement. Disguising as a classical comedy, El método Tangalanga smartly appropriates the personal history and the legacy of an Argentine icon, paying tribute to him and, at the same time, going beyond that in order to tell a story about humor as a superpower.源自：https://www.mardelplatafilmfest.com/37/en/pelicula/el-metodo-tangalanga",
