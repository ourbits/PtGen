From unearthing 180 million year old giant dinosaur fossils to uncovering one of the most important Roman mosaics to be discovered in over 100 years, the rich history of the UK is revealed and examined like never before.This series Alice is joined by a new team of experts who will dig deeper to understand the story behind the finds, and the most exciting artefacts are brought into Alice’s new Digging Tent to be analysed and understood in a way that provides insight and revelation spanning 10,000 years of British history.",
