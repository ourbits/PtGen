    "introduction": "Mud Crab (MIFF 2022) director David Robinson-Smith returns with a stirring cine-poem about the rental crisis, starring Thom Green (Of an Age, MIFF Premiere Fund 2022).A landlord is confronted by one of the many tenants (Green) he has evicted, who forces him to read out a verse – repurposed from lyrics taken from the album Hostile Architecture by Ashenspire – about power, greed and culpability. Surreal vignettes depict the winners and losers of a rapacious property market, revealing the human cost of exploiting basic needs to maximise private wealth.源自：https://miff.com.au/program/film/we-used-to-own-houses",
