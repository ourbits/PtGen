Feeling an utter disappointment to his dad, he decides to follow his two brothers' example, wandering out of the village to learn a profession. Emil and Jockel become carpenter and miller, learning those trades regularly. Max first adopts a vagrant rascal dog and trough his own honesty gets apprenticed by a tailor. He makes slow progress, but by inventing the overall saves his master from bankruptcy. each brother gets a magical gift before returning home. The miller's donkey, under whose tail gold is produced, and the carpenter's table which magically produces any desired meal, get stolen by an inn-keeping couple. Max uses his gift, a self-propelled cudgel, to make them return the rest black and blue.",
