    "introduction": "An exploration of queer identity as queerness has become more mainstream and commodified, the offbeat comedy is inspired tonally, in part, by films like Ghost World, Good Burger and Welcome to the Dollhouse alongside Summers’ diaries, written while in their 20s. The show follows Jovi (Summers) and Tabitha (Kazimiera), two people perpetually disturbed by the world around them that have bonded over a mutual hatred of their peers and society at large, alongside suicidal feelings and drug abuse.",
