    "introduction": "Jennifer Palmer, a corporate IT specialist-turned-writer, is compelled to make sense of the mysterious and powerful energy she felt at her aunt's deathbed. A series of strange coincidences leads her on an exploration of synchronicity - the concept that all beings are interconnected, and that time is not so much a chronology as it is an infinite cycle. Considering herself something of a skeptic, Jennifer treads the fine line between nervous breakdown and ecstatic revelation as she seeks out scholars, shamans, artists, and community activists in her search for answers. Together, they explore a reality where time is transformed from a unit that can be measured and commodified -\"Time is money\"- to an experience of oneness with the natural rhythms of nature and the universe. It is here that the writer discovers that time is, in fact, art.",
