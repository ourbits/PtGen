    "introduction": "Frankly examines a colorful and controversial chapter of modern American history, when individuals and events coalesced to challenge the moral orthodoxy surrounding sex and sexual behavior. Eros moved from the shadows into the sphere of public discussion as people sought to eradicate sexual ignorance, fear and loathing. Activism took root and laws were changed; traditional institutions and gender roles were questioned; pleasure was had, and so was profit. And as with any revolution, there were counter-forces seeking a return to the status quo.",
