    "introduction": "This is an English-language contemporary adaptation of French writer Françoise Sagan’s classic novel Bonjour Tristesse.The story follows Cécile (McInerny), a young woman spending the summer in a villa in the south of France with her widowed father Raymond (Bang) and his latest love interest, Elsa (Harzoune). Theirs is a lived-in compatibility—a world of ease and languor. But all that soon changes with the arrival of Anne (Sevigny), an old friend of Raymond and Cécile’s mother. Anne’s presence and deep connection to the past alters the villa’s mood. While her way of life appears mismatched with theirs, an attraction—years in the making—forms. Desperate to regain control, Cécile sets in motion a plan to drive Anne away with tragic consequences.",
