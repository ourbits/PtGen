    "introduction": "Selahattin is a math teacher in his 40s. He has a passion for poetry. He lives alone on the lower floor of an apartment building and is platonic-ally in love with Ms. Alev, the doctor who lives on the top floor. He writes poems on scraps of paper and deposits them secretly in Alev's mailbox. Selahattin's cousin, Nejdet, and their hometown acquaintance, Riza, are determined to exact some money out of him to build their own business. Selahattin's mother sends him a photo of Nalan, and the same photos also sent to Riza. To stop Riza snatching Nalan away, Selahattin hastily decides to marry Nalan, despite being in love with Alev. Because of Nejdet's facetiousness, Nalan comes to know about Selahattinsending poems to Alev and things quickly become complicated.",
