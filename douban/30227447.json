    "introduction": "The golden age of American art - when American art became indisputably American and indisputably great - was the result of various circumstances.One was the fierce energy of a new society seeking to express itself independently for the first time. But just as profound was the shape-shifting influence of what DH Lawrence called \"the spirit of place\" - the unique landscape and topography that made America different from anywhere else. And that's the subject of this series.In three films, set in three different and crucial American territories, Waldemar Januszczak will investigate where and how American art found itself at last. His ambitious artistic road trip culminates in the heroic achievements of Abstract Expressionism, but also features scores of artists who have been overlooked and undervalued.",
