    "introduction": "On a quiet winter morning, Austin Jack Lynch, son of the American filmmaker, David Lynch, breaks his silence and decides to talk about his troubling functional incapacitation. Speaking in their strange private dialect, the two men try to find the root of the problem located in the oral cavity, elaborating, in particular, on the dangers of dental neglect. And then, after careful consideration, the father and son finally reach a verdict: surgery is inevitable.",
