    "introduction": "Jana, daughter of famous singer-songwriter and actor Ovidi Montllor, lost the only photograph she had taken of her father when she was a little girl.Thirty years after his death, Jana embarks on a cinematic journey to understand the fragility of her personal memories in contrast to public memory. To fill the void, she delves into public archives with a deeply personal perspective, exploring the boundaries between memory and imagination, and speaks with those who knew him best. Through this journey, Jana’s sense of loss intertwines with Ovidi’s, who first lost his political voice and later his physical voice.",
