    "introduction": "Following his divorce, Beat is living at his country house away from Bangkok. His quiet life is turned upside down when his best friend Ong comes to visit for the weekend. Ong has brought along his new mistress Goi, who introduces Beat to Pat, who happens to own a restaurant in town. The two of them bond over their desire to get away from things. The next day Beat’s teenage daughter Lily arrives for her scheduled visit. But instead of being a good father and spending time with her as planned, Beat falls back into his old ways, getting drunk with Ong and trying to hook up with Pat. As the weekend spirals out of control, Beat finds that his attempt to start over has become a mess of his own doing.",
