His goal is for the choir to compete at the World Choir Games in China in nine months time. He has 1,300 potential choristers, but has to find the right mix of students who not only can sing harmony, but have the dedication to see the process through the nine months. Beyond the application and selection process for the World Choir Games, Gareth has some challenges in keeping the group motivated, especially if they are not chosen to go to China...",
