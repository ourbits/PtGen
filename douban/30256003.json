    "introduction": "Spectacle has made this short film about Shaker Aamer to mark the 10th anniversary of his incarceration.Through conversations with activists and former detainees; the film paints a picture of who Shaker Aamer is, the injustices he has endured and what his life has involved for the last decade. From Bagram and Guanatanamo Bay prisons, to the unknown dark prisons throughout the world, Shaker Aamer's story illustrates the lengths to which the U.S. and U.K. governments will go to justify their despicable War on Terror.",
