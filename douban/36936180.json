    "introduction": "The Pop Out: Ken & Friends, or simply The Pop Out, was a one-off concert by American rapper Kendrick Lamar. It was held at the Kia Forum in Inglewood, California, on June 19, 2024. The Juneteenth and Black Music Month celebration marked Lamar's first major performance following his highly publicized feud with Canadian rapper Drake.Lamar unexpectedly announced the Pop Out two weeks prior to the event. Its set list consisted of 60 songs predominantly conceived by musicians based in the Greater Los Angeles area. With DJ Hed and Mustard as opening acts, over 25 West Coast artists performed during the over three-hour concert, including Ty Dolla $ign, Dom Kennedy, Steve Lacy, Tyler, the Creator, Roddy Ricch, YG, Schoolboy Q, Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, and Dr. Dre. Lamar performed four of his five Drake-aimed diss tracks, \"Like That\", \"Euphoria\", \"6:16 in LA\" and \"Not Like Us\", for the first time during his headlining set.The Pop Out was Lamar's second performance to be live-streamed on Amazon Prime Video and Twitch simultaneously, following Kendrick Lamar Live: The Big Steppers Tour (2022). Met with universal acclaim, critics and industry peers praised how Lamar used his historic victory lap to shine light on underground talent and promote unity amongst the West Coast hip hop scene.",
