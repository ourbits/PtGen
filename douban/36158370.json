    "introduction": "What physically happens in the body when it contracts COVID-19The immune system is a highly sophisticated mechanism, the most advanced to have evolved in all our bodies' complex networks. But this precision network is now fighting an uphill battle against a new formidable enemy -- SARS-Cov2. This novel coronavirus surreptitiously slips through the body's myriad lines of defense, spreading unnoticed until the symptoms become suddenly aggravated. How can we cope with this tricky foe? Through the high-tech \"eyes\" of next-generation microscope imagery, the program delves into how our defense corps combats against pathogens as well as sheds light on new important findings about the shrewd characteristics of the virus that causes COVID-19. Also, we discover the mechanism that holds the key in helping to develop vaccines and treatment.© NHK / CuriosityStream",
