He is from Sevastopol himself, and knows a little more about the neighboring state than his friends. His anti-war girlfriend, Alisa, realizing that she is expecting a child, decides to save her young man from a fatal mistake and goes after him to bring him back. Finding a loved one in the chaos of war is not easy. In a few weeks spent in the hell of the assault on Mariupol, the guys will understand that the world lives not only within the framework of their ideas, and their love will be tested for strength.",
