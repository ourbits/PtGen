    "introduction": "The most uncompromising and interesting Greek director strikes again!It's been a while since I last saw a Nikolaides film, one of the pioneering and original uncompromising Greek directors, if not the only one. I thought \"Tha se do stin kolasi agapi mou\" (=I will see you in hell my love), was part of the Singapore Sling saga, but according to the directors comments, \"Tha se do stin kolasi...\" is the beginning of a new saga, more personal, on subjects like damned loves, friendship, traitorship and more.Stylish, atmospheric and very erotic, a film which is likely to equally disturb and fascinate the audience with an open heart & mind. The traditional but intense Nikolaidis cinematography style is ever-present and , as usual, the best part about his films is the performances, dialogues, tabboos broken, fears and norms questioned. Not surprisingly, his characters are at best alienated if not somewhat crazy and delirius.This is not an ultra-violent or bad-taste film, like say, Singapore Sling, but it's not for the sensitive as well. If you like challenging cinema, watch every single Nikolaidis picture. Look out for a very interesting interview featured in the DVD.",
