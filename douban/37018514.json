Now, the Food Network and the NFL join forces in the ultimate culinary competition that celebrates the love of the game, the grill and the gridiron. Food Network star Sunny Anderson and NFL Legend Vince Wilfork give the play-by-play as two teams of real tailgating masters go head-to-head in the parking lot of an NFL stadium, just hours before the big game. Chefs representing the home and away teams battle over three rounds of mouthwatering competition, hoping to win the coveted \"Yum-bardi\" trophy and tickets to the game.",
