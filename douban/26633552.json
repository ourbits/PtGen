    "introduction": "The documentary feature film Openings - The Search for Harry is based on true events and is the story of one man's climb back from despair and anger, closed off from those important in his life, to reconnecting and to rebuilding an authentic, richer life. Sometimes funny, sometimes touching, this film explores life in a way that is both real and insightful. Interwoven into the film are interviews from some of today's most relevant new age personalities who share compelling insights and introduce rarely discussed concepts related to the major themes of Openings. Openings - The Search for Harry is a rare type of film, one that will open your mind as well as your heart.- Written by Anonymous",
