    "introduction": "On a hot summer night in 1985 Greenwich Village, a young man, new to the city, leaves a gay bar with a flamboyant performance artist, but his animated story of Antigone is soon rudely interrupted in this period tribute to the wild gay scene of the mid-1980s. What starts as a hot date soon uncovers much deeper layers of race, class, history, and disease. The concept and identity of the hunter is fluid throughout, as it examines the shifting dynamics of power, attraction, and trust. Adapted from the acclaimed novel \"In the City of Shy Hunters\" by Tom Spanbauer.",
