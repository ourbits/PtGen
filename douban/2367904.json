    "introduction": "Although I liked very much the detailed review of \"Melvelvit\" I would like to add that this interesting film, one of the best in the Mexican movies history, is due to the collaboration of American writer Rian James and one of the most important Mexican writers of the era, José Revueltas, and the Mexican film director Roberto Gavaldón. Actually, \"La Otra\" is one of the best Del Río and Gavaldón films, as well the set designer Gunther Gerszo (sometimes written Gerzso or Gerzo)and photographer Alex Phillips, all important figures in the artistic Mexican world. The \"gothic nightmare... somber night-world ambiance\" is due to Mexican Gerszo, who studied and worked at the Cleveland Play House in the USA, and combined his movie jobs with painting, becoming one of the most important Mexican abstract painters. In movies, he worked with John Ford (\"Sombrerito\", in Hollywood), John Houston (\"Under the Volcano\"), Luis Buñuel (\"Susana\", \"Una mujer sin amor\" and \"El Bruto\" with Kathy Jurado) as well with the most important Mexican directors. He did the sets for Mexican cult films \"El Vampiro\" (The Vampire) and its sequel, El Ataud del Vampiro\" (The Vampire Coffin) about which he claimed, never even watched once they were finished (and they're great as camp Mexican movies examples!)",
