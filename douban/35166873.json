    "introduction": "This is a cinematic ode to the moon, made in large part from archival sources combined with literary fragments and bound together by a haunting original score. The film steps lightly through the ideas that people through the ages have drawn from the moon — dreams of escape, myths of heaven, songs of longing and loss, odes of yearning, stories of lost futures — taking the viewer on a constantly surprising night-walk through the night sky.",
