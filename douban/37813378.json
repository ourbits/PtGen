    "introduction": "The border desert between Mexico and the United States tragically dries up many of the hopes of migrants attempting to cross on foot. In this arid and unforgiving environment, where many lives are lost to the shadows, a Mexican couple works tirelessly to recover the bodies of these victims of the desert, but above all, of our indifference. Distraught families seek out these volunteers daily, who carry out their mission with admirable humanity and self-sacrifice, despite the heavy emotional burden weighing on their lives. Jonah Malak creates a sensory and immersive work, focusing on a couple who choose to restore dignity to the invisible victims of a tragic migratory journey.",
