    "introduction": "Today is a crucial day for the opening of the art museum. All preparations are complete, and the staff are awaiting approval from the director. However, the director insists on having a laughing pig's head, not just any pig's head. Daeho, in charge of the pig's head, searches every room to find a laughing pig's head. Will he be able to find one amidst the absurdities of social life? This film, portrayed with comedic and suspenseful tones, shines even brighter with the performances of actors such as YOON Kyung Ho, KIM Eui-sung, and KIM Sung Cheol.",
