Directed by Molly Reynolds (My Name is Gulpilil), utilising footage captured by Roberto throughout the decades, we see Craig Ruddy in all aspects of his life – preparing for exhibitions, painting his most famous portraits and dancing his way through life. An incredible portrait of a creative powerhouse and an exuberant celebration of love.",
