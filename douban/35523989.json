    "introduction": "Junior is a participant in a nightclub dancing contest and is declared the winner. His prize is a pet monkey whom Junior names, \"Bunkey\", and takes home with him. Unfortunately, he isn't quite sure what his parents will think of their new \"guest\" and is determined to keep the simean hidden from them. Unfortunately, the ape makes all kinds of noise which cause Charlie and Bessie to think a prowler is loose in the house. After disguising the chimp as a baby, Charlie discovers the ape and exclaims, \"Either that monkey goes or I go.\" The family waves good-bye to Charlie who leaves the house, suitcase packed!",
