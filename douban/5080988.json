    "introduction": "Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp was another of Fox's lavishly produced \"Sunset Kiddies\" series, wherein most of the principal roles were enacted by children. In this case, Aladdin is portrayed by juvenile performer Francis Carpenter, while other key roles were filled by such stars-in-the-making as Virginia Lee Corbin, Gertrude Messenger and Buddy Messenger and Lewis Sargent. The film was by no means a parody: the youthful performers played their parts with utmost sincerity, and most effectively. As was traditional in the \"Sunset Kiddies\" films, a few adult performers were scattered throughout the proceedings, notably Elmo Lincoln, the screen's first Tarzan, who here portrayed the towering Genie of the Lamp. Unfortunately, none of the \"Sunset Kiddies\" efforts is currently available for reappraisal.",
