    "introduction": "BOALÂNDIA documents the cultural resistance in the peripheries of Brazil. The protagonists fight for visibility with the means of art. They occupy cities and raise their voice against discrimination, police violence, racism, and homophobia. For three years, the filmmakers worked and lived with collectives and activists, accompanying them in the Amazon rainforest, at protests in the capital, and in the subcultures of Brazilian metropolises. With their own films, the protagonists fight for attention - in the midst of an uncompromising and highly accelerated social reality. Filmmaking, as a narrative form as much as the process of archiving, has a special political significance in this resistance to structural violence. Audiovisual media enable the reclaiming of one‘s own voice, the archiving of one‘s own culture, and - through participation in one‘s own medialization - the writing of one‘s own history. BOALÂNDIA is a portrait of this activism and its vivid diversity.",
