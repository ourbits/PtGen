They experience various adventures and their families are subjected to serious challenges. Provincial society is scandalized and their friendships tested. The four women make great sacrifices to reach the stage. The failure of the show, caused by the son of one of the women, is a bitter bottom-line to the meaning of personal choice and the impossibility to break through the environment in which one lives.",
