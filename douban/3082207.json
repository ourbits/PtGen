    "introduction": "哥伦比亚新浪潮导演Carlos Mayolo的长片处女作，一部哥特风格的幻想片，获葡萄牙幻想电影节最佳女主角和最佳影片提名。是导演向Roman Polanski的《Rosemary's Baby》致敬的作品。\"Flesh of your flesh\" is a political allegory trhough a love story, framed into the magical colombian universe. In 1955, in the middle of a military dictatorship, a teenage girl seduces her brother and due to their incestous relationship the lovers are possessed by the ghosts of their ancestors. The two youngsters become vampirical and criminal creatures like those created by the colombian \"violencia\", mingling with the mythological beings of the countryside like \"drafts\" and other ghost sowing fear into the heart of men.Directed by Carlos Mayolo. Centers on a wealthy family fighting over the last testament of a just-deceased matriarch. From there, the family members are shown to have an incestuous relationship, and eventually vampires come into the picture, as well as unbridled slaughter.Tropical Gothic Baroque. An extremely interesting film about La Violencia in Colombia which captures the strange social and political heterogeneity of this dark set of events. Mayolo developed his own aesthetic - partly in collaboration with filmmaker Luis Ospina and the late Andrés Caicedo - 'el gótico tropical' in order to convey this strangeness. The film combines local Colombian myths - caspi, la madremonte, el hojarasquin del monte - with themes of vampirism and incest to convey the place of La Violencia within a repetitive and cyclical history characterised by interpartisan conflicts that benefit the empowerment of the Colombian aristocracy.",
