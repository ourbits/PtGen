    "introduction": "Matteo, 22, is a motion graphic designer for a production cartoon film company in Bologna. He is introvert, speaks very little, and almost grumpy. In his solitary universe, he gets back from work and gets dressed as a dog and pretends to be Spotty, doing a perfect imitation of an anthropomorphic dog, a role that makes him feel good with himself, unlike when he is just a “human being”. One day Matteo posts a search online for a dog sitter. Eva replies, a 25-year-old off site student, who lives a chaotic life, loses small jobs one after the other and has only highly improbable romances. After overcoming the initial embarrassment of Spotty’s true nature, surprisingly over the weeks, a special challenging relation begins between the two of them.",
