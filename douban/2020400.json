    "introduction": "歌颂以色列复国主义战士们的影片，五湖四海皆兄弟，为了解放为了家园。。。Hill24 Doesn't Answer takes place during Israel’s 1948 War of Independence. It focuses on the personal stories of soldiers – an Irishman, an American Jew, and a Sabra - who are assigned to defend a strategic hill outside of Jerusalem. Through their diverse stories, Israel’s birth and struggle to survive are captured from a distinctly personal perspective.On the way to their last mission – the defense of Hill 24 – the soldiers talk of their past battles and what influenced their Zionism. Through a series of flashbacks, the film reveals each soldier’s story, until they converge at the hill. There, during a nighttime battle, the significance of their mission becomes apparent as their allegiance and bravery undergo trial by fire.Hill 24 Doesn’t Answer explores the fears and hopes of Jews in Eretz Israel and their bloody struggles for independence. This dramatic war epic was shown for the first time at the Cannes Film Festival and it was hailed by the international critics for combination of national symbolism and sweeping personal stories. 50 years after its release, today it is an opportunity to see the way in which the cinema of back then examined Zionist myths.",
