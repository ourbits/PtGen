When Magda invites her to visit, Izumi uses the occasion to practice the language and visit some tourist spots, but she also has another purpose-to fulfill a promise to her dying father, who long ago had fallen in love with a Catalan girl on his own trip to Barcelona. After a lasting pen-pal romance, the girl suddenly vanished without a trace. \"If you ever go there, find her for me. Tell her she was the only true love of m life, and give her back her letters.\" Izumi doesn't find her father's love, but she does find one of her own: Magda's roommate, Jaume. Afraid to repeat her father's sad experience, now what will she do?",
