    "introduction": "On the run having been caught trying to steal a digger – don’t ask – devoted if agreeably stroppy sisters Lisa (Lowe, Sightseers) and Claire (Wells, 45 Years) break down in remote rural Wales.When they steal another car from two eminent poetesses, the hippy-dippy Wilding sisters, they come up with a plan to decamp to a nearby poets’ retreat. There, they adopt the Wildings’ personae and discover the added incentive of an £11,000 prize, as well as their incompetence as poets. And then it’s not long before they find themselves vying for the affections of hunky Richard (Cullen, Downton Abbey’s Mr Gillingham).Brimful of deliciously cringe-worthy gaffes, this dark comedy from writer/director Adams – whose Benny & Jolene, also starring Wells, is something of a companion piece – is a gem of British indie filmmaking.",
