    "introduction": "Diagnosed with terminal cancer and given four months to live, Chika Kapadia decides to end his life. He applies to Dignitas, an organization providing physician-assisted suicide in Zurich, Switzerland, and begins keeping a journal as a sort of religious ritual as he prepares his move there. He asks his close friend, director Shonali Bose, to film his final moments. This is where the film begins. Contrary to what one might expect, Chika’s last two weeks with Shonali are filled with moments of pure joy. They drink beer with friends, take walks with their favorite ice cream in hand, and constantly express how much they love each other—an unbelievably beautiful time. Honoring her friend’s choice with dignity and grace, Shonali Bose celebrates life instead of mourning death.",
