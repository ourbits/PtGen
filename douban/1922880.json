    "introduction": "Good animated short film about a corporate guru who settles in Blowhard, a city where there's a lot of dragons, but no electricity or heat. But our man has a plan: use the dragons to produce power! And so a new utilities is born, Consolidated Dragon! But the dragons are a non-renewable source of energy. Soon, black-outs are inevitable. And those environmentalists who want to save the dragons! This is not good for Consolidated Dragon's profitability. Oh! but they forgot about wind power! Great way to look at our society and its materialistic way of life. Made in 1978 but still of its time.",
