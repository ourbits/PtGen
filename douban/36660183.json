    "introduction": "In this short film at the crossroads between experimental and slow cinema, a brother and sister accompany their brother Jonny, who suffers from cerebral palsy and autism spectrum disorder. He has had to learn to live independently since the sudden death of their mother. Through the filmmakers' cautious, patient gaze on the young man, viewers are invited to rethink the motions of their daily lives and their relationship with solitude. Here, the rhythm is dictated by the protagonist, and every movement, every whisper is important. With humility and generosity, he gives access to his new environment and relates an inner world where his personal story sometimes meets that of the heroes of Greek mythology.
