    "introduction": "A brand new film on one of Britain's best-loved and most influential bands of modern times, XTC. Emerging from the late 1970s punk and new wave explosion, XTC amassed a devoted following with hit singles Making Plans For Nigel, Sgt. Rock (Is Going To Help Me), Senses Working Overtime, Dear God and Mayor Of Simpleton. A colourful and vibrant journey into the world of XTC and their alter-ego band, The Dukes Of Stratosphear, the film includes newly filmed interviews with Andy Partridge, Colin Moulding, Dave Gregory and Terry Chambers. Through a mixture of animation, archive and specially-shot sequences, the film opens up the world of XTC and into the brilliant minds of principle songwriters, Messrs Partridge and Moulding.",
