    "introduction": "The Man Who Swims with Crocodiles Documentary following Chito, a Costa Rican fisherman who is one of the only men ever known to tame a crocodile with people travelling from all over the country to marvel at their bond. He nursed the animal back to health after discovering him blinded by the bullet of a hunter over 20 years ago. Feeling strongly compelled to investigate these legends first hand, Roger Horrocks visits a Costa Rican shaman, “Chito” that swims with a giant croc and even rides on the back of the ancient reptile. This and many other stories confirms Roger’s belief that these giant crocodiles have the ability of showing emotion and creating connections with human beings, an otherwise impossible notion in the crocodile’s long history.",
