    "introduction": "As Cassie and Matthew come to the end of a bitter divorce proceeding, Cassie produces a forgotten letter from their younger selves suggesting advice in the event of a future separation. The letter specifies a list of items to help them recreate memories from the past, so that they \"can let go of each other with love and not with fear\". Matthew reluctantly agrees to doing the item on the list - to meet Cassie in the park where they were first alone together, 20 years before. This meeting starts a chain reaction of events, a release of memories and a confrontation with a challenging past - as the couple start to understand who they became in their marriage. Over the next four intense days, Cassie and Matthew find themselves painfully drawn back together but continue to struggle at what it means to reconnect.",
