    "introduction": "We follow the harrowing escape from Paradise as the town ignited from wind-driven embers and burned within a few hours. We learn from Native Americans as they employ fire to benefit nature and increase community safety. We follow researchers who work to understand the effects of climate on forests and the crucial role that natural forests play in storing vast amounts of carbon.Narrator: David OyelowoProduction Company: [Balance Media](https://www.elementalfilm.com/about)",
