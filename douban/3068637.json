    "introduction": "I must confess that i had very low expectations about this movie. I thought that it would be a bad movie, boring and bad filmed....i was wrong. Los inquilinos is a very good indie horror movie. Its a low budget movie very well made, well directed and with cool scaring moments. Its a ghost movie in the tradition of the Japanese movies like Ringu or The Eye. Its one of the few horror movies from Argentina. If you live in Argentina i recommend you to get this movie, its available in some video stores. Don't know if its available outside Argentina but its a movie that can easily get a limited DVD distribution in US. No gore, its more a psychological thriller than a slasher.The screenplay for Los inquilinos del infierno was written by Alberto Fasce and Pablo Monlezun (the latter also co-wrote the screenplay for Hernán Findling's Director's Cut). The movie stars Anna Carina, Carlos Echevarría, Edda Bustamante, Délfor Medina, Hilda Bernard, and Luciana Bash.Those who are interested in Los inquilinos del infierno may also wish to read the Twitch articles on Findling's Director's Cut, Daniel de la Vega's Death Knows Your Name, Sergio Esquenazi's Dead Line (Interference) - a.k.a. \"Interferencia\" - Adrián García Bogliano's 36 Steps (36 pasos), and (Adrián) García Bogliano's Night Yell (Grité una noche).http://www.kiwiproducciones.com.ar/leibovich/",
