    "introduction": "In a peripheral neighborhood, where the rural and urban worlds meet, the houses of the first migrants, who arrived after the post-war period, coexist with the new blocks of the dormitory city, where the latest wave of migration is concentrated. This humble corner has thus become an authentic global village. Good Valley Stories is a sum of imaginaries, social conflicts, both generational and identitarian, as well as urban and ecological, but it is also a calm and humanistic look at today’s world.",
