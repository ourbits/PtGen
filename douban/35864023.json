    "introduction": "Grief muffles the world. Deadened by her daughter’s passing, Raine’s life is a subdued reel of monotony: long days in her car driving to and from gigs interspersed only with the time she spends languishing in her home, thinking about Luna. It’s only when her ex-husband drops her older son Oscar off at her house for a business trip that it becomes apparent just how much she has lost herself in the quagmire of mourning. Short, evocative, and drawing on a cinematic style that focuses more on character action than speech, ARE WE LOST shines through gorgeous shots of Los Angeles, an emotional score, and child actors who bring a sweet awkwardness and naivete—due in part to director Jenny Gage letting the kids talk and be as natural as they are comfortable being—to characters who are, ultimately, dealing with the effects of poverty, estranged parents, and a mother working gigs at odd hours to make ends meet.",
