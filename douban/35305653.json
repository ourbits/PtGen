    "introduction": "\"L'inquiétante absence\" is a documentary that overviews both history and current state of the genre cinema in Quebec (Canada). Quebec cinema had produced so many acclaimed movies in the past decades that it is quite uncanny to see that almost no horror films, sci-fi films or fantastic films had left any trace in our collective memory. Why is it so? And how can we pay tribute to the (sometimes forgotten) authors of local genre films and local genre fans? To answer those questions, the directors of the documentary had made interviews with some of the most preeminent artisans of our cinema and had met with fans in local festivals and conventions.",
