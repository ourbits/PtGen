    "introduction": "1157年，牛津的王宫寝殿中诞生了一位男婴，长得硕壮有力，哭声响亮。当时人们或许并没有意识到，一个如同亚瑟王时的传奇时代就此宣布了它的开始。当时，英国的国王是亨利二世，是征服者威廉的曾外孙，即位前为法国安茹伯公爵，其母就是征服者威廉的嫡亲孙女。这个身上流淌着征服者威廉血液的男孩被取名为理查。理查的封地在阿奎丹。作为一个王位继承人，理查不仅拥有令人仰慕的权力和地位，而且拥有着过人的智慧和魄力，这使得理查威名远扬。在那个崇尚骑士精神的年代，理查当然会有很多追随者，不管是贵族的格盎鲁人，还是平民的撒克逊人，都来争当理查的座下骑士。这颇有李世民天策府猛将如云的味道。这些人构成了日后理查军团的骨干，并且个个和理查一样勇猛和善战。司各特写的《英雄艾文荷》写的就是理查的一个封地在艾文荷的座下骑士的事迹。Aka. \"Heroes and Villains\" but in the United States this show is aired called \"Warriors\" as we previously happened to go with..Richard the Lionheart.During the Third Crusade, the crusaders arrive in Jaffa and find it destroyed. Uneasiness in the ranks and an attack that leaves one of his close friend's dead, Richard hopes to marry off his sister to Al Adil and create an alliance. However, Al Adil will not agree and the crusaders begin to suffer from a lack of supplies. Finally, Richard decides not to attack Jerusalem and the coalition falls apart. Eventually he must face the decision of protecting his kingdom from his brother or completing his oath to God. In the end, Richard plans to return home but when Jaffa is assaulted, he returns to rescue his men.",
