    "introduction": "Korea | 2016 | 8min | DCP | Color | 12 +<The Mapper>, which the late Lee Kang-hyun worked on until his death, is a story about a worker who determines the coordinates between people and the rest of the globe. The film begins with a form of silent film juxtaposing texts and discordant music on a dark background. Then, with the conversation between Hyejin, the female protagonist of <Possible Faces>(2017), and her uncle, it shifts to a new phase to show people surveying the earth's surface and moving. With this 8-minutes short video, we can see how Kanghyun Lee broadened his interest in places that were off the map or omitted off the map. Kanghyun Lee created the video in 2016 for a presentation, not as a finished piece.",
