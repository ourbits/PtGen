    "introduction": "Tommy Jensen wakes up in the middle of nowhere with a metal Briefcase handcuffed to his left hand. With no recollection of the previous day or how he got there he sets out to discover answers. On his way he discovers that he has been given 9 milligrams of benzodiazopene and a deadly poison. He has 24 hours to live. The anti-dote is inside the case but the key to the case is at the border. If he makes it to the border before the 24 hour deadline he will not only get the anti-dote to save his life, but he will be given $500,000,000 as well. He soon learns that he has the Irish, Italian, and Korean Mafia after him. They have all been told something different is in the case and want that case at any costs. The Koreans have hired the World's Deadliest assassin called \"Dragon\" to retrieve the case. Tommy has his girlfriend and his mentor helping him along the way but with $500,000,000 at stake, Can they be trusted?",
