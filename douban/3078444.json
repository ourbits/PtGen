    "introduction": "A large format 3D experience from the makers of PULSE, THE LAST REEF and GREAT WHITE SHARK 3D.The movie explores South Africa's coastline, and the apex predators that patrol its waters: sharks, dolphins, whales and man... their prey: the supershoal of billions of sardines that lurk in the deep cold waters of the Indian Ocean.  This is where Africa meets the sea...Filmed over two years in Kwa Zulu Natal and the Transkei, WILD OCEAN 3D transports the audience to one of the world's last wild places, and gives them a chance to see the ocean as it once was elsewhere, hundreds of years ago.Written, directed, edited and scored by Luke Cresswell and Steve McNIcholas, with leading photographers Reed Smoot above water and DJ Roller below water, Wild Ocean is a symphonic journey, and a soaring, diving spectacle that fills the giant Imax screen in stunning 3D.",
