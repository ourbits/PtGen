    "introduction": "In an interview with PopMatters magazine in 2017, Kelly said in regards to doing an official sequel to Donnie Darko, \"I’m open to doing something much bigger and longer and more ambitious that could be a new story,\" Kelly said and then added, \"We’ll see what happens. I have a lot of stuff that I’m working on and it’s ambitious and it’s expensive and we’ll see what happens.\"[4] In regards to the 2009 Donnie Darko sequel S. Darko Kelly has said, \"I had nothing to do with it. And I hate it when people try and blame me or hold me responsible for it because I had no [involvement]. I don’t control the underlying rights to [the Donnie Darko franchise]. I had to relinquish them when I was 24-years old. I hate when people ask me about that because I’ve never seen it and I never will, so… don’t ask me about the sequel.\"[4]希望多灾多难的理查德凯利这部能攒起来……算上Amicus和Corpus Christi，都已经连续黄了两个项目了……",
