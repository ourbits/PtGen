    "introduction": "Picture a scene: Eva and Eva dream of having a child in paradise, while a seropositive boy reads Moby Dick at the bottom of an empty pool. Eva is Tânia, a young woman studying to pass a public exam and become a judge. The other Eva is Vanessa, an executive who works at a large publicity agency. Vera, Tânia's mother, coordinates, in fits and starts, an NGO that takes care of HIV-positive children. She has always been a courageous woman and a fighter, as well as a passionate advocate of all liberties. But the fact that her daughter wants to be a mother through the belly of her partner is something she cannot admit. This unthinkable situation brings out a flood of questions, and painful memories of her past as a rebel start to come up. Despite the major differences between them, these two women, mother and daughter, both of them born in a wealthy middle class, still believe in the virtues of dialogue and in the achievements of democracy, while a militarized shallow looms over them. Their story is a portrait of the last months of a period, before the recent presidential election in Brazil.",
