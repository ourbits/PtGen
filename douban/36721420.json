    "introduction": "This scenic report is based on a historical event: the Oppenheimer case. On 12 April 1954, the investigation into the physicist and long-time head of American nuclear research J. Robert Oppenheimer began in Washington. The investigative committee, appointed by the US Atomic Energy Commission, was to examine whether the scientist had behaved loyally towards his country's government. The three-week interrogation, an example and expression of the conflict between the individual and society, science and the state, is one of the most memorable events in contemporary history.J. Robert Oppenheimer, one of the fathers of the atomic bomb, is suspected of having a pacifist-procommunist attitude and has to justify himself and his work to an American committee of enquiry. In the interrogations, which Heinar Kipphardt wrote on the basis of historical documents, the picture emerges of a scientist who considers the social consequences of his research and thus comes into conflict with the state.",
