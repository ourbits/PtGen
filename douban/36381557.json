    "introduction": "Ayyur, which means “moon” in the Amazigh language, paints a contemplative portrait of two children of the moon. In Ayyur, Zineb Wakrim depicts marginalized rural children with tenderness and humanity. This rare hereditary disease makes them hypersensitive to ultraviolet rays and prevents them from being exposed to the sun. The two 14-year-olds, when not covered from head to toe and locked in a spacesuit so they can step out into the light of day, find refuge in art and painting.",
