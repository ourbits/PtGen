    "introduction": "巴西最杰出的纪录片大师Eduardo Coutinho的新作，混合纪实的访谈场景与根据人物对话而拍摄的故事情节，讲述不同年龄层的巴西女性的生活经历，甜酸苦咸与悲喜交集，一切徐徐道来。官网：http://www.cinemaemcena.com.br/jogodecena/Following a newspaper ad, ordinary women tell part of their life stories to director Eduardo Coutinho, which are then re-enacted by actresses, blurring the barriers between truth, fiction and interpretation.The production company published a small newspaper ad asking women over 18 in Rio de Janeiro to tell their life stories for a documentary. 83 women answered the ad, 23 of them were selected and their interviews were filmed in June 2006 on the stage of Glauce Rocha Theater in Rio. In September, a few actresses re-enacted the interviews and commented on their approach, difficulties and doubts.After interviewing 83 women in Rio de Janeiro, filmmaker Eduardo Coutinho chose a handful to appear on film to share their accounts of the female experience. The stories they tell of motherhood, divorce, love, sex, regret and sacrifice are at times related by the women themselves, at others, they are interpreted by actresses, a crafty technique that effectively blurs the distinction between real life and cinematic art.Jogo de Cena is Eduardo Coutinho’s tenth feature film. Coutinho's powerful method and his capacity for understanding and convey his subjects are the infrastructure of his highly acclaimed documentary films.击败《精锐部队》荣膺巴西年度最佳电影，IMDB评分8.8。",
