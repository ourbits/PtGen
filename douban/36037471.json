    "introduction": "The film tells the story of bailiff Karel Jaroš, his mother, former choir singer Matilda, and Karel’s teenage son, Pavel. The withdrawn, emotionally torn Karel does not get along with his extroverted and bohemian mother, and only thanks to a strong sense of duty does he visit her regularly. Pavel, on the other hand, who comes across as an irresponsible flunky, despises his father’s profession and cannot forget that he abandoned his family as a child. The relationship between all three is unsettled, but an unexpected life situation brings them together.",
