Upon his arrival from his poorly attended concert, he finds himself in prison for having stars drawn in his notebook by a little boy. A young illegal activist seeks refugee in the school, where the pupils hide his pistol inside the Gaber's piano. A German officer comes with his soldiers to find the hidden illegal, orders the school to be evacuated and takes the piano together with him on a train.",
