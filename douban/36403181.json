    "introduction": "Agnieszka is a journalist trying to come to terms with the suicide of her 12-year-old son. When, a few years after the tragedy, Agnieszka's husband, Jacek, gets a job in the Netherlands, it seems that this is the perfect time to move and start a new life. She is prevented by Rafal, who many years ago was the subject of one of Agnieszka's reports and is now serving a sentence for murder. Rafal asks Agnieszka for help in solving a criminal mystery. Unaware of the shocking truth she discovers, she gets involved again in a seemingly closed case. It turns out that the murder of which Rafal was accused is related to the death of her son. Instead of leaving the country, Agnieszka begins to obsessively look for torturers who are closer than she thinks.",
