    "introduction": "别以为你只是过客，凡走过必留下痕迹，以令人惊叹的手绘沙画技巧，提示一个关于人生脚步与态度的小偏方。This sand animated film takes you on an amazing dreamlike journey where man and nature transform into each other, reflecting the circle of life.Directed by César Díaz Meléndez who is also the base guitarist for a band called El Combolinga – responsible for the song featured in this video (he plays in a lovely band AND he’s a sand artist/filmmaker? He got my attention, I’m jealous). This may also remind you of the beautiful sand animation by Ukraine’s Got Talent performer , Kseniya Simonova.You think you're just a passenger and that nothing leaves a footprint. Don't forget that you are a message in a bottle.",
