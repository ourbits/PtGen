    "introduction": "Between birth and death is the power to love and live. Political rules, religious orders, social norms, and cultural taboos control who we love and how we love. The right to love is controlled and regulated by how we live. But the erotic has the power to emancipate. With spoken word and archive sources, love is unboxed from categories, through queer expression and through a celebration of eros as the power to change our attitudes to life and to allow others to live their lives without judgment or prejudice.",
