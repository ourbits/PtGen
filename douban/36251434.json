    "introduction": "Since the United States Senate was first convened in 1789, Pennsylvania has had 53 senators. They have all been white men. In this gripping narrative, 31-year-old Pennsylvania State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta takes us along on his race to become the first openly gay person of colour with a seat in the United States Senate. As the campaign progresses, we learn more about Malcolm – his political aspirations, what he means to his community and his personal life with his husband Matthew. This skilfully produced and timely film draws us into the ranks of Kenyatta’s enthusiastic army of supporters. By the final lap you’ll find yourself on the edge of your seat, with bated breath, hoping against hope that this inspiring politician will win.",
