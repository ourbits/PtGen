    "introduction": "An intimate portrait of English punk singer-songwriter and Libertines’ legendary front man, Peter Doherty, as he plunges into the depths of addiction at the very height of his popularity. Over a period of 10 years, Peter Doherty was intimately filmed by his wife, the director-musician Katia deVidas, who shot over 200 hours of exclusive footage. We experience, in the artist’s own words, Doherty’s moving and emotionally charged fight to overcome his demons and emerge from darkness back into the light.源自：https://doclisboa.org/2023/en/filmes/peter-doherty-stranger-in-my-own-skin/",
