    "introduction": "10 years in the turbulent life of the British rock n' roll poet as a singer in The Libertines and Babyshambles, and as a regular in the tabloids. The struggle to quit the drugs is the untold chapter in the story of Pete Doherty - until now.As the lead singer of The Libertines and Babyshambles, Pete Doherty became the most iconic singer and rock n’ roll poet of his generation. First came the music, then came the success, but then came the drugs. At the peak of his career Doherty was best known for his dual relationship with Kate Moss and the tabloid press, and for the turbulent episodes that followed in the wake of his very explicit heroin use. And it is this abuse that ‘Peter Doherty: Stranger in My Own Skin’ finally faces. Over a ten-year period, director Katia DeVidas – now Doherty’s wife – follows the musician as he attempts to overcome his addiction and relapses. Her unique access to Doherty provides a relentless insight into an addict’s struggle to overcome his demons without losing himself and his undeniable artistic genius in the process.源自：https://cphdox.dk/film/peter-doherty-stranger-in-my-own-skin/",
