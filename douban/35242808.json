As the hospitals are full Rim (17) is alone taking care of her sick father when his condition rapidly deteriorates. Seeing no other way out Rim steals her father’s motorbike and embarked on a journey alone after midnight. Her journey takes her through the darkest recesses of shady underworld deals and dreamy encounters with strange characters. As her night precariously balances between the real and the magical. Will she be able to keep her father alive?",
