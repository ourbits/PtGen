Inside the box: the brain of Ulrike Meinhof, which was saved by the authori es along with the brains of the three other leaders of the RAF a er their deaths in Stammheim prison. Doctor Feifer can communicate telepathically with Ulrike’s brain, which is direc ng her to lead a new feminist revolu on. To that end, she is searching for the ideal female body to transplant Ulrike’s Brain into. At the same  me, her arch-rival, Detlev Schlesing- er, an extreme right-wing ideologue, arrives at the conference with the ashes of Michael Kühnen, the former German neo-Nazi leader and infamous ho- mosexual who died of AIDS in 1989. When the two Frankenstein’s monsters of the extreme le  and the extreme right meet, chaos ensues.",
