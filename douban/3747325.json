    "introduction": "Igor Gordic (Srdjan Todorovic) won the gold medal in shooting at the World Championship in 1991. Soon after that success he got drafted by the army as a sniper. During the war the killing of people (or like the film says:\"spilling their brains out\") was for him only possible under the influence of drugs. After his return he quit shooting due to seeing faces of his kills from war in every target he aimed at recognizing that the only thing he can see in any rifle is death. He continued abusing drugs and fell deeper and deeper into debts and problems with Belgrade's uprising mafia-subculture where one of his former best friends (another war veteran) is one of the heads. Sasa Gordic (Vuk Kostic), Igor's younger brother, who's at shooting at least as good as Igor is preparing for a contest in France. The need of money for more drugs makes his brother sell the shooting stand the two brothers inherited by their father. As the new owner limits Sasa's access he takes Igor's rifle from war and takes law into his own hands, but the new owner of the stand is only the first victim to come in this drama. This movie is one of the best works available from the Balkans in recent times showing pretty much the situation Serbia and probably the surrounding countries (i.e. the former Yugoslavian states) were driven into by war.",
