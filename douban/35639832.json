    "introduction": "Elodie Lélu makes the leap to feature film with C’est de famille, which tells the story of Manon, an introverted 16-year-old who finds herself forced to live with her unbearable grandmother Yvonne, a former feminist activist who can no longer live alone. The situation gets worse when Yvonne, confused, begins to mistake Manon for her daughter. For fun, Manon will play along with Yvonne’s delusions and play the role of her mother, whom she barely knew. This is the occasion for her to discover the true story of the women in her family, and to learn, in turn, how to become one.",
