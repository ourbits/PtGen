    "introduction": "Swinging London of the 1960s was a time of optimism, creativity and enthusiasm. The center of this pop rebellion was a carefree and colorful new aristocracy, ennobled over the covers of magazines and charts. Coming from the London suburbs and the English provinces, the young people who made it up were all attracted by the lights of this festival which was to last ten years. One face embodied this new cultural revolution more than anyone: Twiggy (the twig). boyish, her androgynous look, her miniskirt and her kohl line on her eyes, Twiggy is the symbol of Swinging London. Then barely 16 years old, this young model from the suburbs of London revolutionized the established order of respectable English society. She became the world's first top model and the icon of the sixties.",
