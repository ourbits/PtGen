    "introduction": "The story begins in 1989 in a small village in central Bosnia, when 25-year-old Asad returns from law studies with the desire to marry his childhood sweetheart. Not knowing that his son already has marriage plans, father Agan arranges his son's marriage to the father of another girl whom Asad does not even know. After his father's sudden death, the whole village begins to remind Asad of his legacy to his father. That's when boring daily life in the village becomes a dynamic and comical revelation of all the characters and their individual stories.源自：https://tickets.sff.ba/films/2256",
