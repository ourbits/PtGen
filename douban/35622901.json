    "introduction": "The protagonist, a film director, prepares to start a new project. He visits the home of a woman with whom he appears to be friends, following a failed romance. The man tells the woman the story of his new film. Then, the development of Film for the Coming Winter begins to come alive suddenly and calmly. The day of two people and the story of the man′s new film become interwined with brilliant mise en abyme. Film for the Coming Winter maintains a calm daily atmosphere throughout while raising profound questions concisely and ingeniously, penetrating ′my/your′ problems, problems of memories, perceptions, and emotions. Is the person I′m looking at really him or her? Is one person really one person? (JUNG Hanseok)",
