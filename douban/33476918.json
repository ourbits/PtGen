    "introduction": "Single for the first time since she got boobs, and back where she was 10 years ago in her parents' house - Carys the 'rubbish feminist' and lazy author is failing - full on failing. The only thing that has changed is that she's got a 2:1 and no hymen. While everybody around her is managing to achieve insta-perfection, the only thing that soothes Carys's broken heart is graphic American true crime podcasts, which offers her a complete escape from her misery. She's determined to re-create herself as a functioning adult, but with Carys's inner voice expressing her real feelings, her dark obsession creates bloody fantasies while she battles her fears, #lifegoals and her inability to take responsibility for her own happiness. While she depends upon her friends - Lowri, Dan and Siriol and her family to solve all her problems, the fog of the crime stories and her self-obsession blind her to the problems of her friends.",
