    "introduction": "The wickedly handsome James Purefoy stars in this drama about the notorious dandy Beau Brummell. Forerunner of today's celebrity culture, Brummell became famous for his impeccable dress sense and connections with the right people, including the Prince Regent.Credited with making a less flashy and more elegant style of dress fashionable, the beautifully cut clothing that he made popular is seen as an early version of the suit. Having risen to a height of popularity, however, descent was swift. Brummell died penniless in France, having lost the favour of the Prince.",
