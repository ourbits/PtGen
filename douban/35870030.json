    "introduction": "Step into the enigmatic world of Jerry Lee Lewis as Ethan Coen unfolds the compelling story of a musical maverick who defied norms and expectations.Coen, in collaboration with film editor Tricia Cooke, masterfully weaves together a captivating documentary using exclusive archive footage, revealing interviews, and electrifying performances that span Lewis's sensational beginnings in the 1950s to his triumphant resurrection as a country and gospel icon.The documentary touches on key aspects of Lewis's life—his controversial marriage to his cousin Myra, his marriages, medical issues, temperamental nature, and fascination with faith—providing a cross-section of the artist's complex persona. The film is a testament to Jerry Lee Lewis's unapologetic resilience, leaving us with an understanding of why this legendary artist remains an enduring figure in the world of music.源自：https://www.tiff.no/en/film/e88005b8-c9ae-48cf-9092-289d488d5552",
