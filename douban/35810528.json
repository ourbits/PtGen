    "introduction": "Sophie Fiennes’ exploration of the creative processes behind artist Liu Xiaodong’s figurative work is the subject of Half Street, her 40-minute study of the Beijing-based painter and a leading figure within China’s contemporary art scene during the 1990s. Liu’s six-week artist residency at two London  pubs and a Middle Eastern coffee shop in Marylebone, culminated in eight large-scale acrylic paintings of neighborhood residents of Polish, Tibetan, French, West Indian and Arab descent. The residency marked Liu’s inaugural UK exhibition at London’s Lisson Gallery from 27 September to 2 November 2013.为配合 2013 年中国画家刘小东在里森画廊举办的英国首展，著名电影导演索菲·费因斯 (Sophie Fiennes) 创作了一部 40 分钟的关于这位艺术家的纪录片，探索他直接从生活中进行绘画的流畅方式。她的电影在整个展览期间放映，并跟随刘小东将他的画布带到伦敦街头，进入当地的酒吧和餐馆。",
