    "introduction": "After her father's death, Pagona or Pegky, the daughter of an expatriated in Australia, comes to leave with her uncle, Dionysis Katifes, whom his brother assigned with the administration of his legacy, consisting of 100,000 pounds, until his daughter gets married. Dionysis, having in mind to keep the money for himself, suggests to his partner Frixos to marry her. The same plan is on the mind of an impoverished geology professor, Kleomenis, together with one of Dionysis' employees, Chronis. Pegky, however, pleads a fake bankruptcy in order to find out who of the wanna-be fiancés is after her money and not her.",
