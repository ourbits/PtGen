Her course is prescribed until an earthquake causes serious damage to the monastery and its abbot asks her to return to her home for a while until the restoration works are completed. As long as her stay in her home country, her half-sister will celebrate her birthday with a party with many guests. There she will meet for the first time with Peter and the spark that will light will lead to a strong love.
