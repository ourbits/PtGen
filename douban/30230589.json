Among the places Rick visits on his seafood quest are Chesapeake Bay on the east coast of America where he goes in search of the blue swimming crab, the small town of Noosa in Queensland where he finds some of the most innovative seafood restaurants in the world and the delightful fishing village of Hua Hin in Thailand where he enjoys Thai seafood cookery at its best and most authentic.",
