    "introduction": "A woman finds herself, not sure how, in Beirut’s Hall of Fame after closing hours. Like Molly Bloom, and the more virtuous Penelope, this woman waits for her husband. She appears to have set a date with him. But he has not arrived. While she waits for her husband she interacts with the figures/statues in the Hall of Fame. She cleans the dust from their eyes, straightens out the baseball cap of another, she smooths out the cape of a third figure. She works so that they appear cleaner and better arranged. However, while she waits Hanan only makes an effort to improve the appearances of the figures that represent regional and world political leaders who are responsible for the chaos that ravages the Middle East. Despite Hanan’s effort, it will difficult for them to appear ‘clean.’",
