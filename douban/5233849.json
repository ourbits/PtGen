    "introduction": "Vienna. Three elderly ladies are sitting at the table with cakes and coffee. But when it comes to questions about the past, a seemingly ordinary family meeting turns to a strategy of telling stories and being silent.Recalling the past moves on diagonals of social and political contexts: had the history of the 20th century been different, would we have behaved differently, too? The director's relatives have each different memory of the war: one survived Auschwitz, the second was helping socialists in the resistance movement, and the third kept quiet about the brown power as most people in Austria did.",
