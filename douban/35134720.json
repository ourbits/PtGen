    "introduction": "Fly is an interactive multi-sensory narrative experience that returns the awe and wonder to the concept of mankind being able to fly. Our narrative tracks man's 600 year relationship to flight - from Leonardo Da Vinci's dream to Wilbur Wright's reality and, finally, to the unknown future of flight. VR Creator Charlotte Mikkelborg heads up a multiple award-winning team including Amaury La Burthe and Novelab France - who's VR work includes Notes on Blindness (Storyscapes Award, Tribeca) and Spheres (Sundance, Venice Film Festival); while the work on the 6DoF motion platform is being handled by Neil Courbould's Oscar winning practical effects team (Ready Player One, Gravity, Gladiator). The piece had a sell-out run at London's Saatchi Gallery during Summer 2019 and was invited to SXSW and Tribeca 2020.",
