    "introduction": "70岁时，一位冰岛老太太开始在起居室里录制音乐。7年后，她已经发行了59张专辑。歌里除了她的自弹自唱，还混合了各种有趣的声音。她不仅总是对创作，录音充满了各种创新，还包办自己专辑里所有的艺术设计。现在她成了冰岛独立音乐圈里的cult英雄。本片是对她无穷创造力的致敬。At the tender age of 70 she started recording and releasing her own music straight from the living room. 7 years later she had 59 albums to her name with more than 600 songs - an eccentric myriad of catchy compositions mixing in her pets, found toys, kitchen percussion and Casio keyboards. Sigridur Nielsdottir is her name, and before long the Icelandic/Danish musician became an adored cult figure in the Icelandic music scene, represented here by her young apprentices Mugison, Mum, and Seabear. Shot mostly on Super-8 and 16mm 'Grandma Lo-fi' is a cinematic tribute to her boundless creativity.",
