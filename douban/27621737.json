    "introduction": "This 10-part documentary series spends a year at Oak Park and River Forest High School, a diverse and high-achieving school outside of Chicago. Digging deep into the experiences of black students, America to Me sparks extremely candid conversations about what has succeeded and what has failed in the quest to achieve racial equality and overcome bias in our education system.Award-winning filmmaker and Sundance Film Festival veteran Steve James (Hoop Dreams, Life Itself) crafts a humble and daringly honest portrait of these students and the systemic racism they face. Part observational character story and part private confessional, James captures critical moments within this vibrant high school ecosystem.The Festival is excited to present the first five episodes of this captivating docuseries, which aims to bring us one step closer to change and understanding by confronting our fear head-on.",
