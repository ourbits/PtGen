    "introduction": "This is the debut feature fillm by german director Roland Klick who made classics like SUPERMARKET and DEADLOCK.In this debut Roland Klick is searching for the heart and ache of german society in portraying a middle class family in the 60's living in a suburbal area who are confronted with a crime which they don't understand. What comes to surface is a disability to be emotionally able to handle it so the family tries to hide it from society.Before Haneke (in his latest film \"the White Ribbon\" some 40 years later) there was already somebody using the power of cinematic experience to express a feeling about german people and german society which is far from any psychological mumbojumbo that fails in answering questions like: why is there violence in general? why did all those horrible things in germany during WWII happen? \"Buebchen\" doesn't try to fool us with explanations because violence is something that comes from a place that can't be desribed with words - it overcomes you.While recently Haneke was trying to fool us with possible reasons for the horrors of WWII this little piece here by Roland Klick brings the viewer closer to the topic by leaving the reasons out - this is a film about the consequences.------------------------------------SynopsisIn a german suburb a babysitter is too busy with her own teenage business and leaves a boy with his little sister alone. Then the girl is missing. The only way the family and society are able to deal with the horror is to ignore it and hide the truth in the closet.A sharp study of german middle class society in the late 60s.",
