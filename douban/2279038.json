    "introduction": "苏联总会有天才的电影人出现,历来如此...Excellent filmI've seen it once on a festival, at the time it came out, and I was impressed. Would love to see it again, but it doesen't seem to be published in the western Europe.I don't remember much of it nowdays, but the main idea was that there is a forgotten underwater museum somewhere in the sea!So the main characters go in search for it. There are a lot of horrific scenes with a great number of real mentally retarded people, and it takes some bravery to watch it, but, at the end the film can be compared to the ones of Tarkovsky.",
