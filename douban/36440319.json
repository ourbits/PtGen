The emotion between people leads to good and bad results, happiness or misery. In the river of natural life, it is the stream injected halfway and the water vapor evaporated halfway. Two very strong individuals, whether they are right or not, whether they need to be morally criticized, whether they need to be examined by us, in the end, death, rebirth, corruption is all part of the river.",
