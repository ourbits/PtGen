    "introduction": "Experimental film made by painting directly onto the film strip using ink, pens, sand, etc., with no camera. A film that decisively renews the tradition of painting on film. It is an abstract, silent film, with no unifying plot line, in which the only characters are forms and colours.In the words of the artist:The film’s strange title, ...ere erera baleibu izik subua aruaren..., has no meaning, it is made up merely of syllables that sound something like Basque. In order to ensure that the only lead character in the film was the painting itself, J.A. Sistiaga did not even want to give the work a title, but given the political situation of the time (the film was made when Franco’s regime was still in power), censorship left him no choice.So, he rang his friend and fellow artist Rafael Ruiz Balerdi, and asked him to invent a title that had no meaning but that would sound like something said in the Basque language. The name that Balerdi came up with on the spot became the definitive title of the work.",
