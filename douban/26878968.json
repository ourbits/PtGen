    "introduction": "Shot in high definition on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, featuring never-before-seen storm footage, and scored with an original blues-rock soundtrack composed and recorded by storm victims, Mississippi Son is an award winning documentary feature film that tells the heart wrenching and heartwarming story of the people, the culture, and the future in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Born and raised in Gulf port, Mississippi, Emmy award-winning filmmaker Don Wilson was deeply moved by the losses of his family and friends. In this film, he returns home to talk to those who lived through the hurricane and continue to struggle with life in the aftermath of the biggest natural disaster in American history. As the media continues to focus on New Orleans, this film tells the Mississippi side of the story, reminding us all that the Mississippi Gulf Coast was completely destroyed.- Written by AMI [us]",
