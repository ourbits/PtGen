    "introduction": "Tachibana Ayako and Keisuke became darlings of the YouTubeverse due to their cute videos, which mainly she makes but he gets all the credit for. As if that wasn’t enough, Keisuke also cheats on Ayako – watching happy videos of them together while doing the dirty with the other woman. But Ayako will get her credit, and her revenge.In the 1990s, pink eiga films (Japanese softcore erotica) were regularly shown at international festivals – until they suddenly weren’t anymore. However, pink eiga culture continued to produce masterpieces small and grand year in, year out, especially from a company called OP Eiga. Among its 2020 output, Ayako Tachibana Wants to Go Viral shines particularly brightly: a quirky satire on YouTuber mores that turns into a stylish horror film, with many an acerbic comment on modern-day image culture and the selling of a private life (or the illusion of that life) to the public sphere.",
