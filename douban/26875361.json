    "introduction": "When Helga Landowsky discovers the broken jug in an antiques store near the German/Polish border, she wants to have it at any cost. But the old lady has reckoned without Jakub Lato. Because the antiquarian does not want to trade his ware for money. In exchange for the jug, he wants Helga to tell him a story. And a story she can tell. It is an experience from the second world war. A story about pain and loss. And while Helga is still narrating, she and Jakub begin to realize that both their lives are wondrously interwoven. And that they are now, almost 70 years later, telling the story is last chapter together. Because only this way, the story can finally become a good story.",
