Freedom is the byword of existence and Chris, Liam, & Manny are floating aimlessly in this youth-fueled counter culture. Equally lovable as they are inept, they decide to open a bar without any previous ability or concept of what it takes. Through the trials and tribulations of their journey, they come to discover who they are as individuals and what they really want in life.",
