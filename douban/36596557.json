    "introduction": "A film resembling a sensitization therapy, inviting you to breathe deeply and taste the essence of stones. Light reflections guide the transition into a world of dreams and fantasy. Meet Edward Weki, a 75-year-old Sudanese man with Parkinson's disease, whose face mirrors a landscape, his graying beard reminiscent of the fur of a Gotland sheep. Bergmanesque ghosts materialize by Weki's bedside, featuring Alma, a revenant of the nurse of the same name from Ingmar Bergman's film Persona, and a female incarnation of Death from Det sjunde inseglet (The Seventh Seal), aiding him in rediscovering his lost memories.",
