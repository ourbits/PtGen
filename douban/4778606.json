    "introduction": "This outstanding documentary journeys from Los Angeles to rural Russia to investigate Tarkovsky's legacy through encounters with those who collaborated with him. Included are candid memories of the great filmmaker by his son, and reminisces by Bergman-regular Erland Josephson about appearing in The Sacrifice, Tarkovsky's final film. The film eventually lands in the forgotten city of Yurevets, where Tarkovsky spent parts of his childhood, including the years during World War II. The film offers a touching, highly personal and provocative record of the lingering effects of Tarkovsky on an extraordinary range of individuals.",
