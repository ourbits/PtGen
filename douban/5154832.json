    "introduction": "电视台记者挖掘出一个令人震惊的秘密，她深入发觉越显得是自觉坟墓,当可怕的真相终于发现，恐怖才刚刚开始。A television reporter unearths a shocking secret while investigating the horrific murder of two rural Wisconsin twins in this reality shocker purportedly assembled from the found footage of a missing news crew. Meredith Phillips thought she had found the story that was going to make her famous. But now the deeper she probes for facts, the more obvious it becomes that she's digging her own grave. When the terrifying truth is finally revealed, it will already be too late for Meredith and her crew. For the rest of us, the horror has only just begun.When twin girls are found dead in their family’s barn, reality star turned TV-reporter Meredith Phillips (the original Bachlorette - playing a fictionalized version of herself) and her new de-facto camera crew are dispatched to rural Wisconsin to investigate the gruesome deaths. In a drive to break the story, they become entangled in deadly mystery and uncover the small town's shocking secret. The crew's re-edited footage becomes the only evidence of a crime too horrific to imagine. Manger is the rare filmmaker who has the ability to create images that, while only on screen for a few moments, stick in your head for much longer than you want them too.",
