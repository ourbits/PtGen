A task that is, as Lupe will soon discover, easier said than done especially when Elmo (Jordan Herrera), an attractive young man, enters her life and awakens her primal urges. Little does she know that her simple act of infidelity will unleash a series of events that will expose Elmo's true motives for seducing her and unmask Manolo's dark secret.",
