    "introduction": "Unable to find inspiration for his newest piece, young author Liam (Daryl McCormack) takes on the titanic weight of tutoring the son of legendary writer J.M. Sinclair (Richard E. Grant) and his wife Hélène Sinclair (Julie Delpy). Reeling from the mysterious passing of their eldest son, the Sinclairs push Liam to work harder and invite him to stay on the estate grounds with them. Soon enough, lies big and small unfurl as a well-intentioned exercise quickly transforms into a saga of lust, betrayal, jealousy, and the quest for legacy-defining relevance.  A battle of wits begins with everyone carrying much to lose.Delpy, Grant, and McCormack all make triumphant returns to Tribeca in a drama bubbling with explorations of authorship and the inextricable link between family, no matter how broken. Thrilling and darkly comedic, the project questions the efficacy and sour ethical dynamics which may arise from mentorship and the tenuous hopes and dreams many wrap around that very concept.源自：https://tribecafilm.com/films/lesson-2023",
