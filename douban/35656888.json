Without any planning, the memory coming from Palestine began to flow and merge with the diaries I live here, and the virus began to awaken other viruses, which made me spontaneously, as a Palestinian citizen, besieged in the most beautiful Parisian neighborhood (Montmartre), busy documenting aspects of diaries and memories in a period of time that changed the face of the scientist.”",
