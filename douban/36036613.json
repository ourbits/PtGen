    "introduction": "After the Second World War, in devastated, rural Bosnia and Herzegovina, a country of illiterate people, Emerick Blum created a large and successful global company “Energoinvest” that operated with billions of dollars. Taking advantages from the both sides, socialism and capitalism, the firm operated on a unique business model, different from the socialism of the Eastern Bloc and the capitalist West. Through interviews with contemporaries who knew Blum, as well as the archives structure, film brings a portrait of a genius, a story about a system and a way of doing business that today seems like science fiction.",
