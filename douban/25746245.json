Influencal groups of economists and military leaders connect in the \"Nationalen Vereinigung\" a national convention to plan the coup d'etat. Among them the chief of landscaping and member of the board of directors of the German Bank, Wolfgang Kapp and the highest ranked commanding General Walther, Freiherr von Lüttwitz. General Ludendorf, who used to be the chief of the Supreme Army Command during the World War, pulls the strings in he background by his middlemen Pabst and Colonel Bauer. When the government wanted to dissolve the \"Brigade Ehrhardt\", the most powerful Freikorps, General Lüttwitz disobeys this order and orders the troupes to march against the government in Berlin. The Government has to flee, first to Dresden, then to Stuttgart. Large parts of the army follow the putschists, who however, are not united themselves. First victim is Secretary of Finances Erzberger.",
