    "introduction": "When this short “coming attractions” promo was released to exhibitors in 1926, First National was third only to M-G-M and Paramount among the major Hollywood studios and was about to celebrate its tenth birthday. Yes, it had lost Chaplin and survived several takeover attempts by its rivals (the 1928 one by Warner Bros would ultimately be successful), but it had also freshly moved to a brand-new 62-acre studio lot in Burbank and had a still-robust stable of stars, including “sweet, scintillating, charming Colleen Moore, […] Milton Sills, the screen’s great he-man,” Norma and Constance Talmadge, Richard Barthelmess, and Harry Langdon. Films of the recent and upcoming seasons previewed here – Sally, We Moderns, The Unguarded Hour, Men of Steel, The Beautiful City, Clothes Make the Pirate, Lunatic at Large, Kiki, and Just Suppose, only the last two of which survive – represent a good mix of the comedy and melodrama that were the staples of the studio in the late silent period.",
