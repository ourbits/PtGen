    "introduction": "The TV midnight show \"Vermilion Pleasure Night\" was a huge hit in Japan. The Japanese youngsters loved the weird characters and the sarcastic humor that stopped at nothing. Director Yoshimasa ISHIBASHI put together a movie from the best episodes. THE COLOR OF LIFE takes the modern Japanese life with shrill, colorful pictures. With the different episodes of the Zombie Family, Midnight Cooking and the wonderfully wacky Fuccon Family, no eye is left dry. The film is divided into four parts: \"Family\", \"Food\", \"Anger and Fear\" and \"Love\".",
