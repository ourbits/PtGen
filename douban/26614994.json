Jimmy wants nothing more than to return to his fast-paced high life, while Max is starting to have second thoughts about his upcoming - and very expensive - wedding. When Jimmy overhears illegal insider trading during a routine house call, he convinces Max that they should tap the phone line to cash in on the scheme - hoping the money will solve their problems. But when stock tips turn to murder plots, the hapless men are unable to go to the police and soon find themselves in over their heads and flat out of luck.",
