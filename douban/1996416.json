    "introduction": "A Bolivian mother has emigrated to Spain in the hope of being able to keep her family out of abject poverty. When her family member died from Chagas, a life-threatening parasitic disease, she still has to earn for livings far away from her home country; In the Democratic Republic of Congo, where armed conflict is ongoing, women are still under the threat of being sexually assaulted by combatants; In Uganda, thousands of children cover long distances every night to search for places of refuge to avoid being kidnapped as child soldiers; patients suffering from sleeping sickness do not have access to the essential medicines; thousands of Colombian families who are victims of the violence perpetrated by their country's various armed groups on the rural population try hard to return to their homeland.With the help of Médecins Sans Frontières, five well-known directors have come together to give voice to the real-life protagonists of the film, the victims of five of the most under-reported crises.",
