    "introduction": "Metal Gear Saga is the title of two separately produced documentaries released in DVD format covering the Metal Gear series, the first one released in 2006 and a second in 2008. The title was originally used for a public presentation of the series Hideo Kojima and his staff conducted in 2005.The first volume of Metal Gear Saga was given to customers who pre-ordered the North American version of Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence in 2006. The disc came packaged with the European Platinum releases of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. It was never released in Japan.The documentary covers the development of each game from the series' fictional chronology, beginning with Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater and progressing to the remainder of the series, briefly touching the then newly-unveiled Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots (Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops was not yet announced at the time). The documentary features interviews with Hideo Kojima where he reveals specific details of each game, as well as his thoughts on the Nintendo Entertainment System version of Metal Gear and Snake's Revenge.",
