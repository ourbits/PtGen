    "introduction": "Dostoievski's \"Crime and punishment\" revisited, 12 January 2004This film is, in all senses, a modern version of \"Crime and punishment\" by Dostoievski. The essential matter is following a guy trying to do something, but while Dostoievski's character wants to change History, Vladimir is just looking for a job after USSR disappears. And the other main elements of original Russian novel are adapted to 21st century situations by the way. So, if you don't believe in Super-man as understood by Nietzsche and Dostoievski, this is your chance to see the most closed example of what a super man can hope in present world.The title character (Mikhail Rojkov in a strong performance) is a Russian emigre working as a security guard and trying to adjust to a corrupt Argentinean society. This 2002 feature by Diego Gachassin follows Vladimir’s affair with a part-time prostitute and his friendship with another local Russian who works as an intern, plays the saxophone, and drinks increasing amounts of vodka. Gachassin is an accomplished stylist, and the black-and-white cinematography is appropriately claustrophobic. In Spanish and Russian with subtitles. 94 min. (JR)",
