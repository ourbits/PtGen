Erik (Morten Hee Andersen) and Anna (Molly Blixt Egelind) are among the first to be accepted into a nursing school with men and women being trained together. Due to a lack of trained nurses, the danish governement decides, on a trial basis, that it is socially acceptabale for a man to work as a nurse. It is not easy for the men to be accepted as nurses in an working environment with oldfashioned hierarchies and strict disciplinary work ethics.",
