    "introduction": "While not surpassing the original show, the movie was pretty decent. Dave Jesser and Matt Silverstein are great comedic writers and still managed to put together a solid reminder of what Drawn Together once was. There were still plenty of good jokes written from each characters perspective. The animation was almost where it was during the television series. Xander in general as a character seemed to be a bit off, i don't know what the deal was there. I hope this is a beginning to the show getting a re-hash for at least one season. I had also hoped there would be more 10 per center jokes (jokes that only 10% of the people off the street who watch the show understand) but maybe this was them trying to branch out and get a larger audience to possibly rent or buy the film.All and all I give this film a 7/10. It's not for everyone and never will be... but if you have a sense of a humor and aren't afraid to laugh at what many would consider morally repulsive then you will think watching this was worth your time.If anything, you'll be impressed by Hero's new fine-ass lady friend.",
