If you've never seen one of Warhol's experimental films, this one might be a good place to start, but it might turn you off from seeing any more of them. Still, it's something you wont forget soon, it's a lot like the films from the 1890's just showing someone doing something mundane, except it goes on a lot longer. But art it is.",
