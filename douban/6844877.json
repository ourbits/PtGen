    "introduction": "Another ambitious low-budget 3D drama as [A Fish], [Persimmon] unfolds in a public toilet in a rural town. Although its setting is limited to a small space, the film’s 3D effects are surprisingly stunning, and offer a fascinating glimpse into the secretive stories of the visitors there. Korean film star Oh Kwang-rok makes a remarkable appearance.",
