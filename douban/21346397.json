    "introduction": "This DVD seems to be made with a DVCAM, and it follows one of the creators of the japanese dance Butoh, Kazuo Ohno, with 95 at the time (now he's with 101) and his son, Yoshito Ohno.At the time Kazuo Ohno already had difficulties to walk, but his dance, even with his age, is still marvellous, and there is still much we can learn from him, I think - maybe even more now.It begins with a class held in his Dance Studio by one of the teachers there. There are interviews,  dance performances by Kazuo Ohno with his son at the event of his 95th anniversary.",
