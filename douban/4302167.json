    "introduction": "Skin, shocks, and suspense are all on the menu in this arty sexploitation opus from Great Britain. A mummy who has risen from the grave (voice of Valentine Dyall) serves as our guide through a series of stories illustrating the ongoing conflict between men and women. A photographer (Dorothy Grumbar) working on a sadomasochistic photo spread goes to special lengths to see that her model (Anthony Rowlands) has just the right look. An elderly man (Kenneth Benda) dating a female scientist (Yvonne Quenet) is in for a surprise when they have a child. A strange young man (Elliott Stein) hires a call girl for the evening, but the lady in question (Sue Bond) objects when he makes a request that seems rather unusual...or is it? Female secret agent Lindy Leigh (Maria Frost) has a hard time keeping her clothes on as she sets out to capture an enemy military attaché. A cat burglar (Cathy Howard) finds an unusual way of avoiding arrest after she's caught in the act by her latest victim (Mike Briton). And an aging woman (Laurelle Streeter) demonstrates how she's kept in touch with her many lovers over the years. Originally released as Secrets of Sex, Bizarre also appeared in edited form as Tales of the Bizarre, with most of the sexual material and nudity removed; the film was also distributed as Secrets of Sex",
