    "introduction": "讽刺了贝隆主义时期阿根廷的政治选举。A ferocious yet exquisite indictment of Argentine politics and societal mores as practised before, during and after the Peronist dictatorship (1946-1955.) NO ONE is spared in this film: not the self-seeking, hungry oligarchs, not the greasy populist thieves who wish to take their place and certainly not the \"well-intentioned\", or the narcissist who is in denial as to what a banana republic is.The Argentine class structure is deliriously sent off by a superb cast of character actors who offer truly memorable performances, especially Guillermo Battaglia as the conservative enforcer and Alberto Candeau as the brother-in-law who loves champagne and European embassy sinecures. If it weren't so sad, this would be one of the funniest movies ever made.Fernando Ayala (2 July 1920, Gualeguay, Entre Rios - 11 September 1997 in Buenos Aires) was an Argentine film producer, film director, screenwriter and film producer of the classic era. He is widely considered one of the most important Argentine film directors and producers in the history of the Cinema of Argentina.Demicheli initially began as a trainee assistant director in 1942 in El Viaje and within two years he had become an assistant director. By 1949 he had developed into a main film director beginning his role as a film producer in the films he directed and some others in 1958. Between 1950 and 1987 he was involved in the direcotrship and production of well over 40 films, directing and producing films such as Ayer fue primavera (1955) and Argentinísima and Argentinísima II in 1972 and 1973 respectively.",
