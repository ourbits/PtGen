    "introduction": "A layered, absurdist family drama about the vicious circle of domestic violence in central Europe. All based on a fable about a chain of events that starts with a bloodthirsty wolf. The instinctually driven beast of prey is very akin to the aggressive father-in-law of Jaroslav, the anti-hero of this story. A timid ambulance driver, Jaroslav has a complex relationship with his wife, Blanka. She uses their three children as blackmail to get what she wants: his mother's apartment.Various versions of the way Jaroslav attempts to save his marriage are ingeniously told and unfold as a video-game narrative. Roles and power dynamics are reversed, always culminating in a lot of blood and broken crockery. Other repeating elements include a falling jukebox, a choir of commenting women, like in a Greek tragedy, extensive cooking sessions, original metaphors and bizarre dialogue. The film was inspired by extensive research into violence in men's and women's prisons conducted by director Mira Fornay.",
