    "introduction": "以下是官网第三季英文介绍：Borgen synopsis season 3Borgen is about the political power play in Denmark today. It is a drama series that deals with the personal costs and consequences of the struggle for power for the people at the centre of both the political world and the media.We meet a very different Birgitte Nyborg (Sidse Babett Knudsen) in the third season than the person we last saw speaking from the lectern in parliament. She is no longer prime minister. It is two and a half years since she called an election in which she failed to win the required number of seats to maintain the existing government. Nyborg had to resign, and chose at the same time to step down as party leader in order to make way for new, up-and-coming figures. She has thus left politics, and is now a highly-paid speaker in the business world. She also sits on several major boards, which requires her to do a lot of travelling.Her old party, the Moderates, has changed course somewhat. The current party leader is Birgitte's former crown prince, Jacob Kruse (Jens Jacob Tychsen), who previously betrayed her, after which she \"promoted\" him to the post of EU Commissioner to get rid of him. He has contributed to pulling the Moderates in a more conservative direction, so that even on the immigration issue, the party is beginning to approach the politics of the current government, led by Lars Hesselboe.Birgitte Nyborg has consciously tried to put political life in Denmark behind her, but she begins to pay more and more attention to the change of course in the Moderate party. It becomes increasingly difficult for her to observe from the sidelines the political deals that the Moderate are entering into. During a talk she is holding for yet another group of Danish businesspeople, it all suddenly becomes too much for her. She can no longer brush off the recurring question of \"what she would do if she were Prime Minister\". Now she chooses to respond, and to show commitment.She makes the decision to return to politics.Katrine (Birgitte Hjort Sørensen ) and Kasper (Pilou Asbæk) now have a baby son, Gustav, but the couple has already split up. Kasper could not live in a relationship with Katrine once they became a small family, so they now live separately and share equally in looking after Gustav. Katrine is still working a lot as a leading anchor on TV1, and must draw a great deal on her mother to help her to get her everyday life to function. Kasper has been given an analytical political magazine programme on TV1 (\"Juul & Friis\") with TV1's news director, Torben Friis.Torben Friis (Søren Malling) is still head of news at TV1 News, and is comfortable with this position. He is put to the test when he acquires a new, younger boss, and this affects him both professionally and privately.We follow the former prime minister's return to the political arena. Whereas the parliament once was Birgitte Nyborg's workplace as party leader and prime minister, it has now become the goal of her efforts. This season deals with the innermost building block of democracy - how to formulate a position and find supporters for it.In the third season of Borgen, the writers ask the question: \"CAN YOU ACHIEVE POWER AND REMAIN YOURSELF?\"",
