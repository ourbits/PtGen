    "introduction": "59年嘎钠金棕榈提名。Rooted in a farming culture and lifestyle, this routine drama by director Veljko Bulajic focuses on the interactions of a varied group of peasants as they are uprooted from their ancestral homes and packed off to new and better farming lands. Along the way, some travellers have time to enter into or continue a romantic liaison, while everyone responds in different ways to their forced migration. Vlak bez voznog reda was entered as a competing film in the 1959 Cannes Film Festival.During the 1950s foreign directors came to Yugoslavia to make films that they were not able to make in their own countries for cultural or political reasons.In 1959 Veljko Bulajic (one of De Sica's assistants) made Vlak bez voznog reda (Train without a Timetable), a neo-realistic epic about the transferral of whole villages from the poverty-stricken coastal regions of Dalmatia to the fertile plains of Vojvodina. By far his best film to date, Vlak bez voznog reda was made in the days before Bulajic embarked on a career making big budget international co-productions (usually glorifying the major battles of the Partisan war and the exploits of Comrade Tito).The participants in this great migration travelled in freight cars with their few possessions. These trains travelled very slowly and their frequent stops allowed them to meet new people and undergo hitherto unknown experiences. Thus, the film becomes a picture about the possibilities of a better life for the travelling peasants, and about their desires and aspirations for their new land.A film that explores human dignity, at times harshly realistic and bursting with the bitter mirth and acrid coarseness of the rough, volatile, and high-spirited people of Dalmatia, Vlak bez voznog reda is one of the best films of its time.",
