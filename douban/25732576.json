    "introduction": "纪录片《老师》以汶川大地震中为救学生牺牲的老师为叙事开端，将镜头伸入中国偏远地区乡村老师们中间，记述了几位普通老师的教学、生活和内心感受……“一个没有离开乡村土地的人，是否就少有今天我们经常看到的惶惑、不安。当都市里相互比照成为我们生活在这个世界上的原动力之一时，幸福和满足便远离我们而去。有那么一天，当我们距离幸福生活依然遥远，当我们环顾四周依然焦灼，我们会不会想起这些老师，想起从简陋教室里传出的朗朗读书声……”2012年，该片荣获“2012中国（广州）国际纪录片节最佳制作人奖”。Documentary The Teachers is based on a true story from Wenchuan Earthquake, about the teachers who died for saving their students. The film shows the work, lifestyle and feelings of those teachers who work in poor and remote regions in China’s countryside. “Does a person who has never left his rural homeland have less confusion and disturbance than often seen today? When keeping up with the Joneses becomes one of the key driving forces of our lives in this world, happiness and satisfaction will leave us. Some day, when we are still far away from happy life, when we still look around with worrying eyes, will we think of these teachers and will we remember our reading aloud in simple and crude classrooms?”",
