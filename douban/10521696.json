    "introduction": "An extremely gentle, patient, careful portrait of an iconic film artist, where the subject matter surpasses the biographical to reveal precious insights in the phenomenon of film. The audience is requested to make time, in order to witness and experience the creative use of time.This epic documentary subtly introduces the complex worldview of iconic filmmaker and theoretician Peter Kubelka (b. 1934, Vienna). While Kubelka's radical and pioneering body of films is a highly condensed work of little more than an hour, his lectures are legendary for their extended length.These drawn-out presentations on 'what is cinema' and 'cooking as an art form' are frequently illuminated by archaeological objects from Kubelka's eclectic collection. He considers his ongoing collecting to be an expanded film practice that explores the evolution of humanity.Martina Kudlácek has carefully woven an open-ended portrait that contains a wealth of biographical materials, and yet always remains focused on the essence of cinema.",
