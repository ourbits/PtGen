    "introduction": "From personal healing, inspiration grew to create a positive film about people addressing disease with food. There are a lot of negative messages about the state of our nation's health and diet, and we were inspired by the community of people we found who are fighting back against this downward trend. Food As Medicine is a documentary film that follows the growing movement of using food to heal chronic illness and disease.",
