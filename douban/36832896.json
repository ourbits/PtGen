    "introduction": "Pope Pius XII is the most controversial Pope of recent times. His reputation depends on the answer to one question - why did he remain all but silent throughout the Holocaust? This film has, for the first time, tracked down key people who knew him. Eye-witnesses, who told the Vatican at the time about the mass-murder of Jews, give evidence about the response they received from the Pope. Their bitter frustration is still keenly felt. Others who owe their lives to the Pope speak out in his praise.",
