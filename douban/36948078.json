    "introduction": "Bhootaradhana is an indigenous pre-Aryan cult still practised in coastal Karnataka - the worship of benevolent spirits or Bhootas regarded as guardians of the people. The Bhootas are many - animal spirits of heroes, incarations of the mother Goddess and puranic deities - each with an established mythology and iconography. Worshipped in homes and village shrines - Bhootsthanas - they come to life in a shamanistic enactment during the annual/ biannual festival of Nema, also called Koola. This film touches briefly on th history of the cult, exhibits the pantheon of Bhoota deities - their idols and shrines - and presents succinct excerpts of ritual performances, while make up and costume arte treated in some detail.",
