    "introduction": "马里奥·索菲西曾经是费雷拉导演的影片中的演员，他在《北风》（1937年摄制）、《无名英雄》（1940年摄制）和根据吉洛加两篇短篇小说改编的社会剧《土地的奴隶》（1939年摄制）中，比其他演员更好地表达出阿根廷人民的思想感情。和他一起摄制影片的优秀导演有那位手法高超、风格细腻的萨斯拉夫斯基，他在1935—1940年间拍过《逃亡》、《紧闭的门》、《纪念馆》等片。另一方面，弗朗西斯科·慕杰加由于拍了一部生动地描写内心活动的影片《如此生活》（1939年摄制）而一举成名。我们还应举出作家E．拉雷塔导演的散文式的影片《流浪汉》（1933年摄制）、埃利亚斯·阿利比导演的《死胡同》（1938年摄制）和贝尔·西亚尼导演的半纪录性影片《从山岭到峡谷》（1938年摄制）。（世界电影史）A wealthy family of six with three daughters and a son grow together learning from and experiencing all the lessons of life. With firm and loving parents all four children find love and although not all marry right away, they are happy. Even when one parent dies, the household carries on as strong as ever. This is a story of family strength and close personal relationships.This movie is very accurate telling how people lived in Buenos Aires at the beginning of the century. It has very witty dialogs, and very good actors. It contains an intelligent critic of society, and politics. I've found a short clip of this movie, that shows how politics were in Argentina here:http://www.ligadelconsorcista.org/node/1321It tells the life of a middle-class family, and how years came and go. How the children grow up and marry, and how some beloved ones dies, and tells how some things in Argentine's society changes, and how some other things should change, or should have changed. If you study sociology, this is a very interesting movie. Buenos Aires's society was full of European immigrants that added so much to the criollos. In two words: Worth watching.",
