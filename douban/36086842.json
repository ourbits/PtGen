Against-the-grain bad boy Zane becomes obsessed with Becca, the new girl at school. The more laid back James is being leaned on by Beth, his long term girlfriend, who wants him to take a little responsibility over his life. And Mitch is just trying to lose his virginity, but in the process becomes involved with Tilly, the most popular girl in school.",
