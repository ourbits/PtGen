    "introduction": "As described in a film magazine reviews, Alec Craig has a fine position as general manager of a manufacturing firm, but his wife and daughter almost ruin him with their extravagance. They buy everything on the part payment plan, and their daughter Ruth pawns a ring that is not paid for to raise money with which to give an elaborate party. A man tricks her into disclosing the fact that her father’s company has an option on a valuable piece of land. Suspicion falls on Alec and he is about to lose his position. Ruth takes the blame, prevents the man from exercising the option, and a niece of Alec’s redeems the pawned ring.",
