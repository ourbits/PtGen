Their street must undergo urban regeneration and Easelman and The Swine will unluckily be in charge of the project. For the construction project is in fact a cover to get their hands on the oil they have discovered beneath Blågårdsgade. Iqbal and Sille must now fight against the villains and get the money to buy back their building, so they don't have to move away from each other. When Iqbal discovers a chip with magic energy, the kids manage to convince Easelman and The Swine to buy the chip so they can reclaim their building. But the villains deceive the children, and now Iqbal, Sille and the grown-ups in Blågårdsgade must put in every effort to retrieve the chip and expose the villains' secret plan.",
