    "introduction": "The first show ever shown on the SciFi Channel, FTL Newsfeeds were 30 second snippets of fictitious news info that were supposed to have come from the year 2142. This future timeline was fraught with stories of genetic engineering issues, technology trends, space exploration, future entertainment, right to privacy issues and geopolitical intrigue. The series was created by F. Paul Wilson and Matthew J. Costello and was filmed in New York. Costello's daughter Nora Costello appeared in one episode as Keva Handley, a child delinquent arrested for genetically mutating her little brother into a puff-rock lizard. The series ended in a cliffhanger in late 1996.",
