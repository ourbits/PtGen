Hunter was childhood friends with Ben Holister but rumors of horrid abuse made Hunter's parents force him to stop playing with Ben. Hunter was Ben's only connection to reality and the ever-evading hope that he could one day lead a normal life. This disconnect combined with his deep isolation into the dreary world of abuse force him into creating a false view of pain, love, and the world of acceptance around him. Ben returns from this world pitted deeply with anger and terrorizes the friends with the lessons he's learned.",
