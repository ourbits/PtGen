    "introduction": "Genial and sharp-witted Keith Olbermann covers the top five news stories of the day in the course of an hour with stories by other NBC/MSNBC reporters and his own interviews with experts or pundits. Interspersed are such segments as the \"Top 3 Newsmakers of the Day\", \"Top 3 Soundbites\", \"Oddball\" (in which weird news and video are shown for the viewers' amusement), and \"Keeping Tabs\" (celebrity and entertainment news). On Fridays, Keith is quizzed about the events of the week by Monica Novotny, using viewer-submitted questions and is punished or rewarded depending on the percentage of questions he gets right in the time allotted. Guest-hosting when Keith is out has been handled by Alison Stewart. Written by Anonymous",
