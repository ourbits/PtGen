The demarcation line is close to their house, but they still live in a free area. But they are mysteriously given over to the police and imprisoned for eating a goose.

Maria becomes so attached to the house that she wants to rent a room there, and how could they refuse such a charitable person. So starts a strange dance between a group of somewhat non-communicative and transient people. But nothing worries Adèle and Etienne as long as they have enough to eat. Not even the gold bars and dollars they find between two pots...",
