    "introduction": "A college student visits her grandparents’ house in the countryside. It has been a while and she relaxes into a warm welcome. When some noise is heard from the second floor, her grandmother freezes her movement. Is somebody up there? The second floor is dark and there shouldn’t be anybody there…The film vividly depicts the cruel reality that one person’s happiness is built on top of another person’s sacrifice. The film was the winner of the inaugural Japan Horror Film Competition. The director, SHIMOTSU Yuta later adapted this into a feature film, which won the Award for Best Asian Film at Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival in South Korea in 2023 and began its domestic theatrical release in January 2024.",
