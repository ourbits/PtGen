    "introduction": "Alien Abyss is a three-part series looking at the weird and wonderful creatures that live in our oceans. We tend to look to outer space and our imaginations when we think of aliens, but the truth is that our own watery blue marble harbours creatures stranger than anything in science fiction. Over three episodes we look at the strange adaptations, the strange relationships and the strange mating rituals that are right under our noses in the inner space of Earth’s Alien Abyss.",
