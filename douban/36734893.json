    "introduction": "A former starred chef, Laure Grenadier now devotes herself to her activities as a food critic for the channel she created on the Internet. She is also careful to keep her distance from her ex and father of her daughter Amandine, the police captain Nicolas Garnier as Laure has not digested the fact that he left her for a younger woman. However, when a wave of crimes strikes the restaurant owners of Lyon, Laure's resolutions are shattered. Nicolas and his new assistant Baptiste understand that Laure's position in the very closed world of Lyon's restaurant industry and the respect she inspires in the regional chefs are invaluable assets for their investigation. Emotionally involved - her uncle is the first victim - Laure lets herself be convinced to serve as their informant.",
