    "introduction": "A container for stories, between cinema and reality, memories of the past, dreams and journeys in a trip around the world in eleven days. Piazza Grande, the undisputed symbolic location for the Locarno Festival. Stories lived first hand by the ones who frequent, inhabit and experience the Piazza Grande during the Festival period. Emotions felt for one moment, as ethereal as cinema is itself: this is the flamboyant and mysterious magic which perpetuates itself every year in this extraordinary place.https://pardo.ch/pardo/program/film.html?fid=958933&eid=70&dl=978134",
