    "introduction": "A 44-minute documentary made by Criterion about the film n the complicated relationship between the celebrated director, his hometown, and his past, which features various friends and acquaintances that have known him either personally or through work over the years. Participants talk about knowing Fellini and point out where some of the items in the film come from in his personal life. Those involved in the film’s production in one way or another also reflect on the making of it. There are a few surprises in here (specifically that the tobacconist was based on a real individual, if exaggerated in the film) and a couple of amusing anecdotes, though it’s slightly hindered by the fact it’s almost completely a talking-heads doc, which makes it a bit stale.",
