    "introduction": "In the foundational myth of FARSA Producciones everything transmits epicness and tenderness. A group of semi-outsider nerds from a school in Haedo discover, almost by chance, that they can add to the list of games they play the making of short films that, with every resource at hand, imitate the action and horror movies they love watching on VHS and cable. These games give way to Plaga Zombie and its trilogy, with its invincible “first Argentine zombie film” slogan and its international cult status. But the documentary by Nicanor Loreti and Camilo De Cabo is not just the portrait of the evolution of this trilogy and its production company through testimonies and recollections on VHS, but also of the ups and downs of a friendship that is the result of their love for guts and the detachment of brain matter.源自：https://www.mardelplatafilmfest.com/37/en/pelicula/un-millon-de-zombies-la-historia-de-plaga-zombie",
