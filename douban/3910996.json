    "introduction": "A couple is arrested and tortured after taking part in a political demonstration, being sentenced to death.Olney São Paulo was probably the only director arrested and tortured just for making a movie. In 1969, he was in Viña del Mar, Chile, for a festival, when two students kidnapped a plane and headed for Cuba, where they exhibited the film they had taken along with them: \"Manhã Cinzenta\". The military dictatorship in Brasil arrested the director, and besides losing his bank job, he was forced to deliver all the copies and negatives. For a long time, it was considered a \"lost\" film. But a copy of it was kept in secret under a different name in Rio's Museum of Modern Art.",
