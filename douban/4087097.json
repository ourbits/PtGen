    "introduction": "A psychological drama reflecting how an unstable mind can destroy one human being. Farid, who runs a jewel shop, has reported Mansour, a thief who came to sell stolen goods five years ago, to the police. Knowing that Mansour has been released from jail and is coming back to the town, he becomes overly disturbed and paranoid due to his fear that Mansour may come for revenge upon him and his family. However, Mansour has different reasons for returning. Director Priviz Shahbazi does not tell us where Mansour is heading, and shows how paranoid and anxious Farid can be. He ultimately talks about how weak and insecure the human being is by showing the unstable mind of a person and how it can bring about tragedy even if nothing is actually happening. (KIM Ji-Seok)",
