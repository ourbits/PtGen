    "introduction": "An exploration of the life of Anita Pallenberg, European actress and rock ’n’ roll muse. Told in Anita’s own words, from her unpublished memoir, and in the words of her family, this bittersweet film is a never-seen-before look at life with The Rolling Stones. Using Super 8mm home movies shot in the 1960s and 1970s, and contemporary interviews, the filmmakers weave together an intimate and profoundly moving story. Anita was a woman with a wild life: she dazzled the Festival de Cannes Film Festival and and inspired love in those around her, including Tilda Swinton who performed the voice over of the film.",
