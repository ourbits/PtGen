    "introduction": "In the 1950s Neo-realism style was given a boost, in part by what was happening in Italy. The films of Rossellini, Antonioni and De Sica made a powerful impression on Brazil's nascent film community. A series of pivotal pictures were made in the 1950s that responded to the wake-up call of the new Italian masters. Needle in a Haystack (1953) by Alex Viany, The Road (1957) by Oswaldo Sampaio and The Great Moment (1958) by Roberto Santos are a few of the better titles. The energy of these films was felt far north of Rio in the state of Bahia, where several pictures were made. (History of Brazilian Cinema)",
