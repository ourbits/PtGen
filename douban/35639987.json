    "introduction": "入围2020年华沙电影节纪录片竞赛A prison in Russia is more than a prison. To some extent, it is a way of life, a way of thinking, a system of values, and partly the history of the country. Built in the late 19th century in Saint Petersburg, Kresty was the biggest jail in Europe at the time. Its history is inextricably linked with the course of Russian history. The documentary talks about historical facts and what was hidden behind the walls of the legendary prison; about the history of one of the city’s most interesting architectural structures; about the fate of people who served their sentences, and also about prison employees, the history of escapes, love stories inside the prison; about how people went down the steps of degradation, but also rose up to awareness of their mistakes.",
