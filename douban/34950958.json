    "introduction": "October 2019, Great Yarmouth, Norfolk (UK). Three months before Brexit. Hundreds of Portuguese migrant workers pour into town, seeking work at the local turkey factories. Once a favorite holiday destination for the English working class, Great Yarmouth is now an echo of its former glory, a place with one of the highest unemployment rates in the UK. The factories take advantage of the numerous decaying hotels on the beach front to house the seasonal workers coming in from Portugal and Eastern Europe. They do the jobs no one wants. Tânia (also known as The Mother of the Portuguese), is a former worker in these poultry plants and is now married to an English hotel owner. She is the perfect facilitator for the Portuguese workers, but dreams of becoming a British citizen and leaving this dirty business behind by transforming her husband's derelict hotels into refurbished senior citizens homes. But the arrival of her latest group of immigrants for the Christmas season unleashes a series of events that disrupts her volatile existence.",
