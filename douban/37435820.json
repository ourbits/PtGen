    "introduction": "Hovering.The actions taken or strategies made while maneuvering in place.Performing wrong or false actions at a standstill.Maneuver in Place is a video documentation of a performance evoking an audio-dominant play. Performers gathered at a used bookstore create small commotions and record such happenings. The performers produce nonverbal sounds, push a cart while stacking then collapsing a pile of books, take turns reading books, and DJ. By collapsing past and present cultures, the performers gradually create harmony among disparate objects and behaviors. This performance both observes a tumultuous incident at the bookstore and documents the synergy created between audio and performance. This performance is also a consolation to recluses and others who are forced into isolation somewhere.",
