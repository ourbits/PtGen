    "introduction": "SHAI K. is the untold story of Shaike Ophir, one of the greatest Israeli actors of all time. Known as the \"Israeli Charlie Chaplin\", Ophir worked with the legendary Alfred Hitchcock and Marcel Marceau, and became a mega star in Israel. Yet very few really knew the man behind the thousand faces. SHAI K. is the tale of a tragicomic clown, a man who wanted more than anything to make people laugh and to be loved. For this, he paid a heavy personal price. The film recounts Shaike's extraordinary story through the women in his life and the people who worked with him, interwoven with rare archival footage, all coming together to create a fascinating personal and psychological portrait of the man who became an icon.",
