    "introduction": "Writer, poet, playwright, journalist, soldier and patriot, Gabriele D’Annunzio was the man Mussolini was inspired by in the process of building the Italian Fascist Movement. Our story starts when the poet is however ending up his life in exile, determined to fight against the fascist oppression and to not give up his freedom of thought. Even though D’Annunzio accepts honors and appointments from Mussolini, the Duce fears him and sends a young Italian federal to watch over the ‘evil poet’. Yet the poet, even if old and tired, hasn't lost his seductive skills. Will they charm the young soldier to the point of making him question himself and its faith to Fascism?",
