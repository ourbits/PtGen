    "introduction": "Mae Nak is a deconstruction of the one of Thailand’s most popular ghost story “Mae Nak Phra Khanong” as well as the most popular genre of ghost films (more than twenty versions exist). The story is about the jealous spirit of a woman who died in childbirth while her husband was away in the battlefield. In the film, Mae Nak resists the death that would separate her from her beloved husband. The film eschews traditional narrative and instead experiments with silence and movement to evoke life after death.",
