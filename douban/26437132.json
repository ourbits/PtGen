    "introduction": "Pooploser 69 (who prefers to be called Snake), and Fart Garfunkel have been hiding from a horde of zombies overnight. They meet Noobly after barricading themselves in the ground. After some hasty introductions, they all decide to head for a highly populated community East of the spawn point, which Noobly had heard of before he joined the server. Later, when the sun is setting, they all get resources to build a shelter to defend themselves from the mobs. They finish the shelter, but Noobly asks if they have any materials left for the roof. Just before the credits roll, a zombie's growl is heard.",
