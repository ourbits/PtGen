    "introduction": "Mokhtar, a young high school student, manages to publish, by the Union of Women of Tunisia, his first novel in which he talks about the problems of Tunisian youth, the new generation after decolonization and the liberation of women. It is a success and he gives many interviews. But he notes the recovery of his work by the bureaucratic system of the single word and the single thought in force in the country. He decides to write his second novel, whose hero is a young girl with a broken past. Then Mokhtar disappears in what seems to be a suicide, but the character of his second novel continues to live after him. In this film, which sought an innovative relationship between cinema and reality, all the cultural leaders of Tunisia at the time that Mokhtar encountered played their own role.",
