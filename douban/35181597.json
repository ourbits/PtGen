    "introduction": "In 2006, the U.S. government decided to build a fence along its Mexican border. Three years and $3 billion later, award-winning filmmaker Rory Kennedy offers this revealing and surprising look at the story behind the fence's construction and its ultimate efficacy. Built to contain illegal immigration, crack down on drug trafficking and protect America from terrorists, the project has given way to unforeseen, even absurd, consequences. Featuring candid interviews with border patrol guards, ranchers, environmentalists and voices from both sides of the immigration debate, the film provides an insightful and often humorous analysis of the contradictions and misinformation that have dogged the fence from its inception.",
