Instead, he was to become the most important record producer in the 1960s. This documentary retraces the career of the man nicknamed \"the king of singles\". Around him, a new generation of stars, producers, musicians and lyricists would emerge, who together would set up an \"independent\" record industry like no other in the world.",
