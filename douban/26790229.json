    "introduction": "»For us humans, warm-blooded creatures, the distinction between hot and cold is fundamental. Our ancestors come from the ice ages. We can stand the cold. We cannot stand cold-heartedness.« Alexander KlugeIn May 1967, Theodor W. Adorno wrote to Alexander Kluge: »Dear Axel, […] I am extremely keen to see you soon for a thousand reasons, also to talk to you about the idea of a film about the cold.« Kluge is now taking up Adorno's plan to make a film about the cold current that dominates our world 43 years later - with 30 stories and 30 short films in the filmedition suhrkamp. He is supported in the tried and tested manner by Durs Grünbein, Werner Herzog, Helmut Lachenmann, Helge Schneider, the polar explorer Artur Tschilingarow (the »Hero of the Soviet Union« who rammed a Russian flag made of titanium into the seabed at the North Pole in 2007), Peter Weibel and many others.Alexander Kluge, born in Halberstadt in 1932, is a writer, filmmaker and television producer. In 2009 he was awarded the Theodor Adorno Prize by the city of Frankfurt. News from the ideological antiquity (fes 1) and Fruits of Trust (fes 15) were published by filmedition suhrkamp.",
