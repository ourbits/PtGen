    "introduction": "The Last Day focuses on a special journey undertaken by four men from a provincial town. The mayor, the policeman and the leader of the Christian Youth Association accompany their friend Adrian on his trip to a monastery, where he has decided to start a new life as a monk.The mayor, an amateur filmmaker, offers to film the group's journey to the monastery, but he also has some secret plans for Adrian. The wishful monk runs away from his past, but the past catches up with him and gives an unexpected twist to the whole story. The cast includes Doru Ana, Mimi Brănescu, Adrian Văncică and Rodica Lazăr.The film was shot by George Chiper-Lillemark from 20 April to 10 May 2015. After several unsuccessful applications to the CNC, Achim decided to produce it independently as a low budget film through his company Green Film. The film was coproduced with France’s C-Story Productions. Christine Sirli is the coproducer and Dan Burlac is the delegate producer.\"The actors are associate producers, the team worked for free and most of the equipment came through partnerships or through the extraordinary collaboration with friends including Tudor Giurgiu, Marcian Lazăr, Cristi Puiu, Ada Solomon, Cătălin Rudolf, Dan Chișu and Ovi Preda. The film was possible also with the support of Unicredit Bank and Borsec. The production costs were 8,000 EUR and postproduction, which involves a lot of VFX, about 10,000 EUR. That’s an absolute first for Romania\", Achim told FNE. The budget was 20,000 EUR.",
