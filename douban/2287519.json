    "introduction": "Richard Kaplan’s lively documentary reveals the human face behind the American icon, beginning with the emotional deprivation suffered by this plain, awkward little girl born into a socially prominent and powerful family. Though she would eventually marry a man who would look beyond her awkwardness, Eleanor was not content to be the proper, silent wife to her husband Franklin’s extraordinary political career. Instead, she began a lifelong crusade to speak out about injustice and oppression in any form. Upon its theatrical release in 1965, THE ELEANOR ROOSEVELT STORY was showered with praise and accolades, including the Academy Award® for Best Documentary Feature and Best Film of the Year by the National Board of Review.",
