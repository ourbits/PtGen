    "introduction": "A story of five teenagers (1 gay, 1 closeted bisexual) who are setting up an armed gang: a drug fuelled sexually charged mosaic of love, lost relationships, betrayal and nihilism, that takes place in a declining city, where everything is collapsing within the economic and social crisis.Constantine Yiannaris, one of the greatest directors of contemporary Greek cinema, returns with another explosive film about Athens today, deservedly winning the Audience Award at the Film Festival of Thessaloniki. Five teenagers are driven to the police interrogation room and tell the same story: how they reached the crime. But it is the same story? As we watch the different (and sometimes contradictory) versions of events we see unfolding before us, full of suspense, mosaic teenage love, impulse and thirst for freedom. As members of a gang, the young heroes get a first taste of life as adults and are intoxicated by what he has to offer them, without considering the destruction sow around them. And beyond the limits, entrained by the vortex of developments.",
