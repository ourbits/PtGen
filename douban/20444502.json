    "introduction": "After Sam and Diane's admission of mutual attraction and their passionate embrace and kiss, where do they take it next? Diane wants their first time to be special for both, and although Sam knows that this relationship with Diane may be something more than just a fling, he is still just more interested in satisfying his animalistic needs. After some debate, they end up at Diane's apartment. Once there, they get into another of their heated arguments based on the differences in their personalities, initiated by Sam's ridiculing of Diane's menagerie of stuffed animals. Diane eventually kicks Sam out, who storms back to the bar for support. Carla however says to Sam that she knows how he can get Diane back: exert his manly power over her. Sam heeds the advice. Diane has her own reaction to Sam's manly power, but Diane's reaction isn't all it appears on the surface. Sam's reaction to Diane's ultimate reaction is unequivocal in its intent.",
