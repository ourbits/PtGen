Already adrift in her life, the loss of her mother prompts a trip to Amsterdam to look up her estranged half-brother Gabe. With a childlike disregard and flair for disruption, Liz soon revamps long-simmering tensions with Gabe. To make matters worse, Gabe's girlfriend Joey becomes a fixture in Liz's life, further complicating an already deteriorating family dynamic.",
