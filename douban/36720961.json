    "introduction": "Bruce Elder’s Consolations picks up where Lamentations left off in the purgatory of modern existence, and aspires to regain, and reaffirm, a sense of meaning, goodness, beauty and mystery in the empty simulacra of the dead world. A philosophical meditation on everything from language to consciousness and aesthetics to morality, Consolations is a gargantuan achievement and a key part in Elder’s The Book of All the Dead cycle, inspired by Alighieri’s Commedia and Pound’s Cantos.",
