    "introduction": "Set in the summer of 1968, the story centres on the political awakening of a group of young Swedish women. The politically aware reporter Karin (Mikaela Knapp) tries to land her dream job at one of the big Stockholm newspapers, but has to content herself with a summer substitute position at a sleepy backwater daily in Ystad. It doesn’t take long for her and her rebellious artist friend Lottie (Maja Rung) to stir things up in the little community where people have barely heard of Paris’ May 68 protests.",
