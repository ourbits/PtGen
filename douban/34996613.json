    "introduction": "It's the 100th anniversary of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. So James Rolfe decided to review it on this week's Cinemassacre movie review. Dr. Caligari is a German silent horror film released on February 26th, 1920. Directed by Robert Wiene and written by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer. Considered the quintessential work of German Expressionist cinema, it tells the story of an insane hypnotist (Werner Krauss) who uses a somnambulist (Conrad Veidt) to commit murders. The film features a dark and twisted visual style, with sharp-pointed forms, oblique and curving lines, structures and landscapes that lean and twist in unusual angles, and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets.",
