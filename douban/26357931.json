Moving into his father's lake side cottage, he gets a job and reconnects with childhood friends, Julie Warner, Kevin Duncan, and Stan Kirkpatrick. Everything is going well until he starts suffering terrifying nightmares about a missing local teenager, Darren Walsh, being tortured in a stone dungeon by an unseen maniac. Through a series of repressed memories, Collin ultimately makes a startling discovery that leads him to realize that there may be a connection between the missing teenager and his own abusive childhood. Just when he's sure of what's going on, his entire world is thrown upside-down.",
