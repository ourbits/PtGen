    "introduction": "Johann is a gay thief, hustling older men for money and moving from city to city when the law takes notice. Max is a lonely young security guard, instantly attracted to Anna, a thirty-something insurance clerk. They all live in Berlin and move to the rhythms of New Germany -- a society redefining itself after the Cold War era. Johann, Anna and Max become intertwined in a triangular relationship, sharing their love, affections, bodies and anxieties in Anna's apartment. Like the style of the club music -- trance -- the characters flow in and around each other in a way that makes them rethink themselves socially, culturally, and sexually. A dynamic view of a triangular relationship and the myth of metropolitan life.",
