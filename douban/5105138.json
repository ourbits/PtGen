These scruffy but adorable dogs are the best of friends, a real team. Who needs money when you've got your friends - and the security of Miss Lilly's mansion? But then a sudden mega-inheritance turns these pups into a pack of pampered Millionaire Dogs. Before you can say \"Who let the dogs out?\" these hot dogs are out of the fat and into the fire. Now they're in for the biggest adventure of their lives. Can their 'all-for-one and one-for-all' loyalty overcome their selfish dreams of fame and fortune?",
