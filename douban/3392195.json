He is from Chile and hides at a police station of the town. He desperately denounces that he has been kidnapped, that they want to kill him and that he is called Berrios.The denunciation reaches Judge SANTACRUZ, who asks his assistant, lawyer Julia Gudari, to take charge of the investigation. Julia shortly finds out that the police have tried to erase all traces of the case. She does not find any answers at the Embassy of Chile either. JULIA finds out that the Chilean citizen is a biochemical engineer who worked secretly for Pinochet, who was convinced he would be able to \"gas Buenos Aires with chemical weapons\".Julia starts to unravel a dark story which involves her directly, as both her father, General Gudari, and her brother, Ivan, are part of the alliance and will do everything they can to keep Julia away from the truth.",
