    "introduction": "Kat Emerson could really use a Christmas miracle! The aspiring singer-songwriter may have big dreams, but she has even bigger problems. Treated like a servant by her vain stepmother and self-involved stepsisters, Kat is forced into a demoralizing job as a singing elf at billionaire Terrence Wintergardenâ€TMs Santa Land. But there is one bright spot to the job: Nick, the handsome new Santa at the tree lot. When Kat gets invited to the prestigious Wintergarden Christmas Gala, her stepfamily is determined to prevent her from attending and snag their own invitation. Could an attentive dog, a loyal BFF and a sprinkling of holiday magic help turn things around for Kat? Join Laura Marano (Disneyâ€TMs Austin & Ally), Gregg Sulkin (Marvelâ€TMs Runaways) and Isabella Gomez (One Day at a Time) in this modern-day reimagining of the cherished classic, featuring original music and holiday favorites.",
