    "introduction": "Not as good as I expected\"E Se Domani\" (which is a line of famous Italian song) is vaguely based on the true story of Mimì Rendano (Luca Bizzarri) who, after having held hostages in a bank, planned to throw the money he stole over Milan from an helicopter.... and got jailed while trying.The movie is a long flashback to tell the economic rise (and fall to bankruptcy) of Mimì, his love for Ketty Lomunno (Sabrina Impacciatore) and his friendship with his lawyer Matteo (Paolo Kessisoglu).All in all it is a \"not so\" movie: not so good-not so bad-not so funny-not so boring. The plot is pretty simple, with no major twists or surprises, and even if this cannot be considered a fault of the writers (as it is based true story), it surely does not make the movie more enjoyable.PROS: -Some fun scenes -Based on a very peculiar real-life fact -Good acting -Enough unrelated to specific aspects of the Italian society to appeal foreign viewers (if it will ever be released outside Italy)CONS: -Not as fun as someone may expect -The story is simple...the movie may seem slow -Some cartoon-like characterizations (and -in some shots- colors and visual effects) which don't match the rest of the movie.All in all, it is not a bad movie... but fails to be emotionally or visually intense, nor it is as fun as someone may expect from Luca & Paolo.",
