    "introduction": "American producer James Boyce and his airhead wife Amber rent an English country mansion where the British horror flick \"Smoke Rings\" was filmed twenty years previous. Amber's mother was model-actress Mandy Mason, who died mysteriously after her appearance in \"Smoke Rings.\" The property rental to Boyce was arranged by middle-aged lawyer Henry Harris, who continues to live with his lovesick memories of the late actress. Boyce invites Harris to dinner, and \"Smoke Rings\" airs on TV that same evening. During the following days, Harris observes Amber's schizophrenic behavior veering parallel to events once experienced by her mother and also to the movie's plotline.",
