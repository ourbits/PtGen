    "introduction": "In the corridors of a hospital in Caracas, two people coming from very different worlds coincide in a distressing night. The only things they both desire is their son and daughter saving their lives. She is Antonieta Sánchez, a humble singled-mother who fought to give her son Odulio a good start in life but lately became a juvenile delinquent. When Odulio is shot, Antonieta's life won't be the same. He is Benigno Robles, a Public Prosecutor. The day after Elisa, his only daughter has been shot, Benigno’s life will neither be the same. However, this encounter between Antonieta and Benigno, apparently a product of chance, is not fortuitous. A secret is hidden behind the false coincidence.Luis Alberto Lamata studied History at the Central University of Venezuela and scriptwriting at the EICTV San Antonio de los Banos (Cuba). Since 1982, he has been directing, writing and producing works for cinema and TV. His first feature-film, Jericó (1990) received the Grand Coral award at The Havana Film Festival, amongst others. Other titles which followed are \"Nude with Oranges\" (1996), \"The first Time\" (1997) and \"Miranda Returns\" (2007). El Enemigo (The Enemy) is an adaptation of the play Un Corrío muy mentao, and won the Audience Award at Trieste Film Festival. His next film \"Boves, The Capercaillie\" is in pre-production stage.",
