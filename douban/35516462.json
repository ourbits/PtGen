    "introduction": "With the help of a free-spirited neighbour, his rebellious sister and the Lord Jesus himself, Thomas finds the courage to rebel against his father’s strict religious regime.Thomas can see things no one else can see. Tropical fish swimming in the canals. The magic of Mrs. Van Amersfoort, the Beethoven-loving witch next door. The fierce beauty of Eliza with her artificial leg. And the Lord Jesus, who tells him, “Just call me Jesus.” Thomas records these visions in his “Book of Everything”. They comfort him when his father beats him, when the angels weep for his mother’s black eyes. And they give him the strength to finally confront his father and become what he wants to be when he grows up: happy.",
