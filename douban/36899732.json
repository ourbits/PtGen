    "introduction": "Rarely staged in France, William Shakespeare’s classic made its return to la Comédie-Française in 2015 for the first time in about 50 years. Ruf’s take on the play remains as close as possible to Shakespeare’s original masterpiece, in a “Southern Italy where the sun hits town squares and heats up people’s minds. (…) An Italy of vendetta where vengence, death are inherited from a generation to the other…”.Érif Ruf is also responsible for the scenography of the play and collaborated with Christian Lacroix, a regular at la Comédie-Française, as costume designer.",
