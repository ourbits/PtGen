    "introduction": "A film for Chick Strand, commissioned by Punto de Vista for the project “LAS CARTAS QUE NO FUERON TAMBIÉN SON/THE LETTERS THAT WEREN’T AND ALSO ARE” for which several filmmakers were invited to make filmed letters addressed to another filmmaker they did not know personally. In hers, Rinland shares a conversation with her mother, who she had asked to watch Strand’s Fake Fruit Factory (1986), a film, like Rinland’s Those That, at a Distance, Resemble Another, concerned with the idea of the replica. Rinland’s mother tells her “Parecía una película tuya” (it seemed like one of your movies).",
