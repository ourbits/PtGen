    "introduction": "Deirdre's life is split between her day job as a barista and her passion for designing rooftop gardens. When Deirdre accidentally spills coffee on regular customer and event planner Marcus before a big meeting with his boss, it sets the wrong tone for him to discuss a job promotion. Deirdre offers to help Marcus get back on track by lending her rooftop-garden-design services for his boss' next big event: a wedding. His boss agrees to Deirdre's help but also wants Jacob, Marcus' competition for the promotion, to co-plan the wedding. As they work around the clock together, Marcus and Deirdre notice something more about each other and love takes root. But a series of misunderstandings threaten to wilt their growing love. It will take a small miracle to bring them back together where love blossoms: Sky Gardens.",
