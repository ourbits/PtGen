    "introduction": "Poignant and expressive, this sepia-tinted melodrama takes us into the turbulent streets of 1950s Iran during the nationalisation of oil by Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh. Faced with an oil embargo and a plunging economy, the people are asked to support the government by buying bonds. A scheme by working-class citizens to take money from the Iranian National Bank and give it to the prime minister to prop up the economy goes awry, leaving the gang torn by partisan ideology, morality and greed.Seasoned filmmaker Masoud Kimiai channels the grit of Francis Ford Coppola and Sam Peckinpah through a prestigious cast that includes Amir Aghaei, Poulad Kimiai and Mehran Modiri. He explores themes frequently found at the heart of his films: working-class comradeship and an impossible desire for honour in a community ravaged by lies, cruelty and dirty politics.There is more at play in this film than the obvious business of corruption and desperation. Set against a tragic backdrop, life, love, sacrifice and loss unfold for the women involved, as well as the men. Complete with cops, robbers, dishonest politicians and a barman named Eddie, Killing a Traitor will leave you wondering who are your friends and who are your enemies?源自：https://iffr.com/en/iffr/2023/films/killing-a-traitor",
