    "introduction": "The unresolved 1991 murder of the young Sisak girl Ljubica Solar inspired the director to tell a story about the young generation he himself belongs to. The lives of these people were to a large degree affected by the war and they are facing the eternal small-town dilemma: to go or to stay? By telling a story about a dead girl and her mother - who has an idea who the murderers of her daughter might be but gets no help from anyone - Devic also tells a story about Sisak's dark side. I Have Nothing Nice to Say to You is a documentary film noir about a city that the war has made even darker than it would normally be. Owing to the unusual blend of a socially relevant subject and a highly aestheticized auteur style, one critic called this film \"Croatian documentary (anti)Twin Peaks\"!",
