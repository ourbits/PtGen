Thomas, in the autumn of his life, lives a simple and isolated life in his below-street-level apartment, accompanied by a radio, a chess board, and a photo of his wife. He does not venture outside very often; and when he does, the outside world reminds him of his advanced age, his loneliness, and times he would not care to remember. He feels like a never-ending story; and to make himself whole, Thomas has to face his past. \"I am old, and life is long\". First work.",
