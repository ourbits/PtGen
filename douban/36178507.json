    "introduction": "Franz Kafka said: \"Writing letters is like getting undressed in front of ghosts, who are avidly waiting for it... written kisses don´t reach their destination, they are drunk by the ghosts\".\" All the letters I never sent is inhabited by the ghosts of those letters that never reached their destination or recipient. In a neighborhood frozen in time that nevertheless will change and that keeps the memory of thousands of secret stories, hidden in the streets, in houses and corners. Mothers seeking reconciliation with their daughters, confessions of unrequited love, loneliness and so many searches for answers that will never come.",
