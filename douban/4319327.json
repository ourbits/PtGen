As the women vile for the prize, they learn how to eat dinner, handle cutlery, serve tea, walk in high heels, dance, and act as a proper royal should be. The prize? A royal title, a glittering Harry Winston tiara worth one million dollars, and the honor of being crowned the first ever \"American Princess.\"",
