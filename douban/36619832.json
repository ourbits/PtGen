Crossing Ireland, England, Norway & Denmark the band follow the Whitesnake Forevermore tour across Europe. They've got no money and no idea what they're doing - just blind faith that one day soon Jim will be sharing a jacuzzi in a 5 star hotel with the Dad of his dreams... and hopefully some hot Asian chicks.—Anonymous",
