Supported by her ride or die mom and best friend, Savvy decides to take control of her destiny and sets out on some renovations, from her career to her kitchen. Isaiah, the dashing contractor, falls for more than Savvy’s delectable cuisine and may just be the secret ingredient to heating up Savvy’s love life, even as she finds her true calling.",
