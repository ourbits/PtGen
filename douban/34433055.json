    "introduction": "Two couples, four characters portrayed by eight actors, based on texts, some poems by Gerrit Kouwenaar. The film follows four persons (each played by two different actors alternating in the roles) as they rush about the streets of Amsterdam, each of them extremely busy doing something. One highlight of the film is the reading of several of the poems of celebrated poet Gerrit Kouwenaar. Despite its severely experimental style and deliberate storylessness, this film was sufficiently inventive and rhythmically interesting to receive a warm reception from some critics. [Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide]\"Ongedaan Gedaan\" (or, Undone Done, my translation)is a very formalistic movie from a director praised by Straub-Huillet. Because of the abstract (at times absurd) form, focussed mostly on rythm of movement, images and words it can be watched without subtitles. But on the other hand it features poetry from the famous experimental poet Gerrit Kouwenaar... so Dutch speakers have more to enjoy. There is not much to translate, but the poetry might require an above average translator.",
