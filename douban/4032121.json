    "introduction": "Probably the most famous of Bauer's films is Licem u lice (Face to Face, 1963), film which is considered as the first Yugoslav political film. It tells a story about a rebel worker who challenges a manager during the communist cell meeting in a huge construction company. Initially followed by political controversies, the film was supported by communist party officials at last, which was understood among filmmakers as a green light for more overt social topics.This movie, one of the first who spoke of Yugoslav socio-political system with some criticism, is set in one company. On the routine workers' council meeting a few brave workers stand against a corrupt manager.  A worker is brought before communist officials and accused of writing an anonymous letter in this political drama. Although he is innocent of the charges, none of his fellow workers come to his defense. When he is fired by the manager, the workers rally and vote the manager who fired their friend out of office in a show of solidarity of their labor rights.",
