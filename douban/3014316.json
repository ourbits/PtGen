While visiting Butterfly Island, Wan discovers her special ability to dive and stay under deep sea.

Wan soon realizes that her newfound powers come with a price; she's not a normal girl. Her body will be transfered into a kind of creature when she gets into the water. Once again, it's Tan who must help Wan figure out what's going on with her body without knowing that a mysterious secret awaits him under the sea.",
