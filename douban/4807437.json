    "introduction": "Swedish filmmaker Arne Sucksdorff was for nearly fifty years a standard bearer in the realm of the documentary. After studying natural history in Stockholm and Germany, Sucksdorff took a long trip to Italy. He returned with a full portfolio of scenic shots and nature studies, which won him a prize when they were reprinted in a Swedish film magazine. From still photography, Sucksdorff graduated to films, turning out a series of consummately photographed Swedish short subjects (one hesitates to characterize these with the demeaning label \"travelogue\"): An August Rhapsody (1939), A Summer Tale (1941), Reindeer Time (1942) and many others. Travelling to other lands for photogenic material, Sucksdorff won a Cannes Film Award for the 1951 short Indian Village; he has also filmed extensively in Brazil. Another Cannes award was bestowed upon Arne Sucksdorff for his 1957 home-grown feature The Flute and the Arrow. Never selling his name to a sponsor or cause, Arne Sucksdorff wrote, directed and photographed movies essentially for his own personal pleasure; it just so happened that they also provided limitless enjoyment to millions of others.After filming documentaries for some twenty years Sucksdorff made this his first feature film.Göte (Tomas Bolme) is a young teen who seems to be at odds with his family and may not know his own mind that well either. Discontented and rebellious, Göte joins up with two mean-spirited game poachers in spite of the fact that he loves animals and nature. This contradiction between his own feelings and his need to rebel reaches a climax when a forest ranger starts to track down the young men in ever-tightening circles.",
