    "introduction": "Hoarders is an American reality television series that debuted on A&E. The show depicts the real-life struggles and treatment of people who suffer from compulsive hoarding disorder.[1] The series premiered on August 17, 2009 and concluded its original run on February 4, 2013, after six seasons.[2]Over a year after the program's original cancellation in 2013, Lifetime began airing a series of weekly \"Update\" episodes on June 2, 2014.[3] Each broadcast presents an episode from earlier seasons, ending with a present-day visit to a featured hoarder by the therapist or organizer who worked with him/her. Interviews with the hoarder and his/her family reveal how their lives have progressed since their first appearance on the show. This led to the production of a seventh season, Hoarders: Family Secrets, which aired on Lifetime from May 28, 2015 to July 30, 2015.[4]The program returned to A&E for subsequent seasons beginning with season eight on January 3, 2016. \"Update\" episodes continue to run between seasons under the titles Hoarders: Where Are They Now?, Hoarders: Then & Now or Hoarders: Overload.",
