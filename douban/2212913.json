The ship heads to London, with the criminals trying to find the diamond in the mansion of the millionaire Terry Landon. They do not succeed and abduct Terry's daughter Ellen asking the diamond as ransom. However, Terry does not have the stone, and Kay Hoog discovers that it is in the Malvinas Island.
