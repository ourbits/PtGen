    "introduction": "From The Director of the acclaimed documentary, Steak (R)evolution, comes Look Back In Angus – the extraordinary and compelling story of how a small black Scottish cow came to dominate the world of beef.This is a tale that unravels a surprising history, shadowing the Scottish diaspora over the last three centuries and taking us from the mountains and straths of Scotland, across the Atlantic to North America and south to the plains of Argentina.This is a story of amazing food, but also genetic dominance, telling how the ancient genes of Scottish cattle are now found across the world in breeds as far apart as New Zealand and Japan.It’s more than just a food story, it’s a love story about Angus, the Queen of the Scot’s breeds, the local and global hero, the best cow in the world!",
