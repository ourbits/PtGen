    "introduction": "Broadway: Beyond the Golden Age is the sequel to the feature film documentary Broadway: The Golden Age, which documented American theater in the 30s, 40s and 50s. This second installment of director Rick McKay's Broadway film trilogy continues the story from the legendary Broadway season of 1959 (Gypsy, Raisin in the Sun, Once Upon a Mattress, etc.) through the tumultuous 60s (Hair, Oh, Calcutta, etc.), the revolutionary 70s (Sondheim, A Chorus Line, Chicago, etc.), up to the opening night of David Merrick and Gower Champion's 42nd Street in 1980. Once again, McKay tells the story with in depth, candid, personal interviews with over 100 newly filmed, legendary stars, while incorporating never before seen footage of the original productions, as well as home movies and photos from the stars' own personal collections, bringing to life a lost era in American history. Many of the stars of the film went on to become household names from their subsequent fame in film and television, and talk of the differences in the mediums and how the theater gave them the foundation for their success in front of the camera.",
