    "introduction": "The film is a psychological drama that flirts with science fiction and approaches the delicate universe of João (Gabriel Pardal) a guy that tries to put a somewhat unusual plan into practice - stop time. And in order to do that he will have to commit some kind of social suicide. Isolated in his tiny rear apartment in a forgotten neighborhood, on a dystopian Rio de Janeiro, neglected by many but resided by the only ones who didn't have the chance to leave before the great crisis, proves that stopping time becomes an arduously lonely journey that will make João face extreme consequences",
