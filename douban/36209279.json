    "introduction": "“When a young concert promoter launches a festival in 1969 to revive the Kings of Rock 'n' Roll, unimaginable events manifest the 11th hour arrival of John Lennon and The Plastic Ono Band, triggering his decision to leave the Beatles.”“REVIVAL69: The Concert That Rocked the World, is the remarkable, behind-the-scenes story of how a little known, but life-altering music festival came together — against all odds. Young, scrappy concert promoter John Brower puts his life on the line (literally) to turn his failing Toronto Rock n Roll Revival into a one-day event, later coined in rock mythology as “the second most important event in rock & roll history.” And it almost didn't happen.The festival united rock legends like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Bo Diddley, and Gene Vincent, with The Doors, who were the biggest band in the world. But it was the 11th hour arrival of John Lennon and the Plastic Ono Band that ignited a truly seminal moment for the 20,000 fans at Toronto’s Varsity Stadium.”",
