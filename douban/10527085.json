    "introduction": "Vladimir Semyonovich Vysotsky was an iconic Soviet and Russian singer, songwriter, poet, and actor of mixed Jewish and Russian descent whose career had an immense and enduring effect on Russian culture. Although best known as a singer-songwriter, he was also a prominent stage and screen actor. The multifaceted talent of Vladimir Vysotsky is often described by the word \"bard\" (бард), a term that carried a special meaning in the Soviet Union. Vysotsky was never enthusiastic about this term, however. He thought of himself mainly as an actor and writer rather than a singer, and once remarked, \"I do not belong to what people call bards or minstrels or whatever.\" Though his work was largely ignored by the official Soviet cultural establishment, he achieved remarkable fame during his lifetime, and to this day exerts significant influence on many of Russia's popular musicians and actors who wish to emulate his iconic status.",
