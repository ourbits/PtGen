After meeting Alfredo's grandmother, the sweet and crazy Donna Maria, the pair go to see Alfredo's father, Sor Pucci. Alfredo must break the news to his old-fashioned father about his secret. Little did he know his secret will churn into a series of unexpected comic events. This tongue-in-cheek comedy runs parallels alongside on the choices we make.",
