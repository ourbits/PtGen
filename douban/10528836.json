    "introduction": "THE SONS OF TENNESSEE WILLIAMS, tells the story of the gay men of New Orleans who created a vast and fantastic culture of wildly popular 'drag balls' starting in the late 1950s. These men worked with the traditions of Mardi Gras to bring gay culture into public settings in the early 1960s. By 1969, there were four gay Mardi Gras clubs legally chartered by the state of Louisiana, throwing yearly extravaganzas at civic venues around the city. 'Society matrons begged for ball tickets from their hairdressers'. They succeeded in bringing down the 'Jim Crow' type laws that targeted gay people during this period, staging a flamboyant, costumed revolution without politics and won freedoms during a time, as now, when laws and people fought against them.早在石墙事件发生的10年前，新奥尔良著名狂欢节（Mardi Gras）反串舞会上的同志们就已经在为他们的权利在进行抗争。这部出自蒂姆·沃尔夫（Tim Wolff）之手的纪录片时而幽默时而愤怒，为我们呈现了不一样的过去。",
