Matchmaking is a bit of a hobby for Maggie, but she is thrown off her game when Jaxson, her old boyfriend from her college years, shows up at her work-as a newly signed, successful author. Maggie would love to deny she feels anything for him still, but Jaxson isn't making it easy. She'll have to face her decisions of the past, along with Amanda eyeing Jaxson, to bring together the perfect matches at Christmas.",
