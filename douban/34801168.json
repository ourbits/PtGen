    "introduction": "When an elderly Beijing couple receives notice that their son has allegedly committed suicide, they travel to Vancouver to investigate the mysterious circumstances of his death. Skillfully employing a docu-thriller style, Ying Wang follows the grieving parents for a decade as they navigate a new culture and a complex web of bureaucracy in a search for answers. In revealing a distressing connection between immigration and mental illness, the film also serves as a powerful testament to parental devotion.",
