    "introduction": "The production is based on an intensive effort by filmmakers to enhance original NASA film footage and photographs using AI-based software and other image processing techniques. The clarity of these stunning images gives viewers a whole new perspective on what it was like to step onto the lunar soil and ramble about the alien landscapes. The film shows how these brave astronauts collected evidence that has since revolutionized our understanding of the origin of the solar system, Earth, and life. © MagellanTVNarrators: Alex WyndhamDirector/Writer: David Sky BrodyExecutive Producer: Thomas Lucas",
