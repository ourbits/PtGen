    "introduction": "The sixth sense has never ceased to feed fantasies. In reality, humans do indeed possess one, mysterious and buried deep within each of us: proprioception. Essential for balance, orientation in space and coordination of movements, for walking, running or jumping, but also for writing or buttoning one's shirt, this little-known sense is now being explored by science. If it has no dedicated organ, like the eyes for sight or the ears for hearing, proprioception results from the processing by the brain of nervous messages, carried by thousands of sensors in the heart of the muscles. Without this sense, like Ginette, who is deprived of it, it is impossible to walk without looking at one's feet, because the brain simply does not know where they are in space.",
