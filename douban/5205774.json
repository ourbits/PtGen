    "introduction": "AOEO is a modern fairy tale about a young, masked man who lives in the suburbs of a big city. A place where lot's of people do very weird things, but strangely enough AOEO is isolated from everything and everyone. He is lonely, not in a sad or tragic way, but completely filled with a deep feeling of longing: He loves the melancholic atmosphere of the sunrise, climbing the roofs until above the city and to dream about how beautiful life could be. As the story progresses AOEO stumbles through one strange event into another suddenly finding himself pursued by drug dealers and having fallen in love with a girl from a gang of bodacious bank robbing babes. At this point AOEO realizes that it's far too late to turn back to the life he used to live. The thin facades of his dreams start to break down and reality defies the man behind the mask. Aoeo symbolizes a facet of the young generations spirit: Overwhelmed and covered up by the chaos of todays society they are inwardly searching for freedom and fulfillment.",
