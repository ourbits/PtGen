    "introduction": "This sensory, immersive and highly cinematic experience follows two women who have a special connection to water. Seventy-four-year-old Ilka lives on an island, where she swims regularly in the ocean with sea lions and other aquatic creatures, and fishes and sails to find meaning and peace after surviving a tsunami. Barbara, who is 35 and a world champion swimmer, has a near-traumatic experience each time she dives into icy waters, pushing the limits of her endurance while swimming in amazing natural landscapes at extreme temperatures. Through gorgeous cinematography and exquisite sound design, director and sculpture artist Caro Bloj explores the synchronicity of these two women immersed in water. Ilka and Barbara each build their identities through finding refuge in water while empowering themselves, continuing to develop their swimming practice, and defining their relationship to water on their own terms.",
