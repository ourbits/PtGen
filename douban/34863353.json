    "introduction": "The thin and slightly repetitive story of this fiction film is built around showing off a number of places where the wealthier members of the audience could spend their money on various items, such as expensive clothes, shoes, luxury cars, or dining at a fancy restaurant. (Simpler moviegoers had to settle for being told what coffee to buy – in this case, Brana-Kaffe, which is prominently displayed on a table and mentioned in an intertitle.) This multi-product-selling structure makes this film different from the others in our series, which are made to advertise only one brand or product.",
