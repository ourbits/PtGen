    "introduction": "The lounge of a psychiatric institution; a wedding game; the waiting room of a doctor's office; a man on the parapet of a huge condominium; a lonesome old woman; rush hour; dinner patron at a fancy restaurant. Everyday depicts seven little everyday situations in static scenes. It combines slowly mounting tension and unique rhythm in its narrative. Uniting the seven scenes is the absurdity of everyday life amidst the loneliness and ignorance of urban life. In a collage of small cruelties, the city is a madhouse, where it is not clear who is a visitor and who a patient.",
