    "introduction": "In 1938 mixed race baby Shirley Bassey,her mother and eight siblings are living in a poor area of Cardiff after her father is imprisoned for sexual offences. The teen-aged Shirley will help the family finances bringing her big,impassioned singing voice to local clubs and,in 1954,aged seventeen,she moves to London,impressing agent Mike Sullivan. To further her career however she must give up her illegitimate daughter Sharon to be raised as her own child by Shirley's sister Iris. After winning over the famously hostile Glasgow Empire audience Shirley has arrived. Impresario Jack Hylton stars her in the West End and she has hit records. She rides out gutter press interest in Sharon and,after a row with Mike,takes fledgling film producer Kenneth Hume as her agent and husband. Not only does he fail to further her career but turns out to be a homosexual. Yet Shirley is a born survivor,weathering her divorce from Ken in 1965 and,decades later,still every inch a star,belting out the autobiographical song 'My Life'.",
