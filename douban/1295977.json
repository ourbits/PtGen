    "introduction": "An unseen man recalls four days of his youth when he came of age. He is Simon, in mid teens, in awe of his father who's planned a robbery with the down-and-out Fury. Dad double-crosses Fury, using Simon in a switch of the bag of cash. Unknown to Simon, however, a bank guard later shoots dad dead and wounds Fury. Simon leaves Ontario, as planned, heading for a remote Québec town. When Fury discovers the money gone, he follow Simon with the aid of Simon's neighbor, Feather, who's been dad's lover. En route to Quebec, Simon is picked up by Chrystal, a wild woman who's just left her husband. They all meet beside a lake for a final sorting out of money and relationships.",
