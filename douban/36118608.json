With the help of young agent Marco Assari, Corso begins to rebuild his career by competing against his ex-wife, Elena De Gregorio, and her father, Dino De Gregorio, for the lucrative signing of football champion Quintana and young talent Antonio Lagioia. An unexpected game of alliances and betrayals takes shape with the arrival on the scene of Sasha Kirillov, an experienced agent from Russian company Plustar, who is determined to be successful on the Italian football market and win the prestigious signings held by ISG.",
