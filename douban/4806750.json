    "introduction": "In this B&W, documentary-style, futurist, experimental film, Christian fundamentalists plot to take over the US, while a queer underground organizes to fight them. The loose story revolves around Carlos and Ben, high school students in NYC and in love - in spite of their bigoted classmates attempt to break them apart. Together these two teens join with a revolutionary group to fight the powers that be. Piecing together altered stock footage with a small film of these two boys in love, the filmmaker manages to put together an interesting short film. Highlights are Carlos's (Giordano) lovely rear -- on display a few times and the diary writing by novelist K.M. Soehnlein (The World of Normal Boys).",
