    "introduction": "What is the state of health of migrants people coming to Spain? And, when they are here, how the reception conditions influence their health? La Salud Naufraga is a short documentary about the state of health of migrants who have arrived to our costs. The conclusion is clear: reception in Spain makes people ill. The hygienic conditions, the deficient food, the overcrowding, the lack of information and a long etcetera generate suffering and lead to a serious diagnosis: we are making people physically and psychologically ill.",
