    "introduction": "Sir John Mills' life told through his own colour home movies!'Moving Memories' is a unique opportunity to experience the life of a film legend through his own 16mm home movies. Sir John started shooting in 1948 before home movie making became widely accessable. He shot on the then groundbreaking colour reversal film which means that many of his colour clips are behind the scenes on movies released in black and white, such as 'Ice Cold in Alex' and 'Dunkirk'. The cast list for these never before seen home movies is extraordinary. Sir John recorded personal moments with unforgettable stars.Moving Memories features interviews with Sir John , Hayley, Juliet, Jonathan Mills, & Lord Attenborough. It features classic movie clips, plus never before seen personal home movie footage, and amazing behind the scenes shots. A truly unique film (60 minutes).Following the discovery of 12000 feet of personal 16mm home movies in Sir John Mills' attic, Marcus Dillistone directed and edited 'Moving Memories', a 60 minute film which tells the extraordinary life and career of Sir John Mills, uniquely told through Sir John's own behind-the-scenes footage!The 'cast' of these unique home movies reads like a cinema who's who: Rex Harrison, David Niven, Stewart Grainger, Jean Simmons , Dickie Attenborough, Dirk Bogarde, Ernest Borgnine and Angela Lansbury... to name but a few!",
