    "introduction": "\"Way to Abbottabad\" is a hard-hitting political and family thriller focusing on the uplifting tale of a man's perseverance in pursuit of justice which leads to peace among the nations in order to benefit the world in its prevailing battle against a backdrop of evil. Once, the WORLD was divided as B.C and A.D. Silently, the world divided again as\"Before 9/11\" and \"After 9/11.\" It was not written on rock, still undocumented and unspeakable. \"Way To Abbottabad\" is the chariot that will band together the people to restore the overwhelming joy that we had B9/11.",
