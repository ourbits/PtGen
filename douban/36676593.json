    "introduction": "In her 21-year professional career, WNBA basketball legend Sue Bird has won five Olympic gold medals and become the most successful point guard to ever play the game. Alongside her fiancée, U.S. soccer star Megan Rapinoe, Sue confronts her next challenge: retiring from the only life she’s ever known.A trailblazer in every sense of the word, Sue Bird achieved a powerful impact on the game of basketball. Navigating through adversity in the form of sexism, anti-LGBTQ+ prejudice, and racism toward many of her peers, she managed to forge a path for young women that previously didn’t exist. The lack of resources for women’s sports in the U.S. led Bird to spend her offseasons playing in Russia, where, ironically, she received the recognition and equity that her male counterparts enjoyed back at home. Emmy and Peabody Award-winning documentarian Sarah Dowland gets to the heart of what makes Bird one of the greatest and most influential athletes the world has ever seen, both on and off the court.",
