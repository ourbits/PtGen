    "introduction": "Showing a day from the life of an ordinary young Georgian obsessed with the instinct of self-destruction, desperate protest and morbid nihilism, this film is one of the last Georgian films created at the period of the collapse of the USSR in 1989 1990. Levan Glonti does a wonderful job at portraying a collapse of an empire reflected in the collapse of an individual. Dge (The Day) was released soon after the break up of the Soviet Union, in 1991.",
