    "introduction": "Why I Hate the Sixties examines the truth behind the myth. It suggests that we were living on borrowed time - we partied as Britain lost an empire and slid into unchecked industrial decline.Archive footage and contributors of all political stripes build the case against the decade where dreams turned to nightmares…The Charges:* Architecture: An obsession with modernity meant out with old and in with the damp-stained concrete, huge tower blocks and anonymous estates of rotting flats.* Transport: Think the trains are bad now?

The best-selling single of the 60s was a slice of pungent cheese, Release Me by Englebert Humperdinck.* Sport: England's World Cup victory is still celebrated as the pinnacle of the country's sporting success.
