    "introduction": "Two wealthy buffoons, Munnu and Bunnu, get involved in a conspiracy to replace a Chief Minister with a lookalke by some corrupt government officials. Meanwhile, Munnu's identical cousin, arrives for a visit from the rural parts, and is mistaken for the real Munnu. The city-wise Munnu visits his cousin to find a safe place to hide out, and is mistaken by the local townspeople for his cousin. Written by AnonymousHasmukh Rai has a problem, as a matter of fact two problems in the shape and form of his two sons, Munnu and Bunnu, who are slackers, and always up to no good, and in to practical jokes. Hasmukh finds that both his sons have been lying to him about their school and college grades - both in studies and sports - and have not been attending college for the last 3 years. One of their practical jokes gets out of hand, and as a result Bunnu disappears, and Munnu gets involved with a conspiracy of replacing the State's Chief Minister with a look-alike person, and the results are hilarious.",
