    "introduction": "This is an amazing film - I have seen it about ten times and get more out of it every time I see it. The cast is so believable, it's as if you are sitting in the room with these women and they are reading your mind. One of the most amazing scenes is one in which a woman, who has been trying to get pregnant, sings the most beautiful song about a child to the woman for whom the shower is being held. I cry every time I hear it and I believe the tears in the film are real as well. Victoria Foyt, in addition to being a true beauty, is amazing, not only as an actress but that she wrote this. I highly recommend this to anyone who's clock is ticking, or even if it's not ticking.",
