    "introduction": "“Something NEW,” the cagily titled (after a Beatles album) documentary on the making of his “NEW” album that premiered on Palladia Dec. 5 is a welcome look at the creative process, but it left McCartney fans wishing for more.The hourlong show, which will be repeated several more times during the month, tells the now well-known story about how McCartney came to use four producers – Giles Martin, Mark Ronson, Paul Epworth and Ethan Johns – on separate tracks.The film features comments from each of the producers, McCartney and all of his band members – Rusty Anderson, Brian Ray, Paul “Wix” Wickens and, especially, Abe Laboriel Jr., who offers the most commentary.source:http://www.examiner.com/review/review-paul-mccartney-s-something-new-reveals-some-but-not-too-much",
