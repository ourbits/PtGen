    "introduction": "Two friendly fellows search in vain for a cup of coffee in the early morning. Ingenious as they are, they swiftly change into an old carnival horse and thus gain entrance into an elegant villa, which a lady has converted into a home for animals. There, mistaken for a four-legged beast, they get all the care and attention they did not receive as human beings.A series of funny accidents culminates in a fight with a blacksmith, as this »horse« refuses to be shoed. Their trick is then revealed and they are evicted, leaving with a vague impression that they were better of as horses.",
