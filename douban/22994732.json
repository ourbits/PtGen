    "introduction": "Bob Dylan sang it. Elvis, too. And that’s only the beginning when it comes to “Hava Nagila”. Follow the infectious party song on its fascinating journey from the shtetls of Eastern Europe to the cul-de‐sacs of America in this hilarious and surprisingly deep film. Featuring interviews with Harry Belafonte, Connie Francis, Glen Campbell, Leonard Nimoy, Regina Spektor and more, Hava Nagila (The Movie) takes viewers from Ukraine and Israel to the Catskills, Greenwich Village, Hollywood — and even Bollywood — using the song as a springboard to explore Jewish history and identity and to spotlight the cross-cultural connections that can only be achieved through music.“When you find a song that says, ‘Let us rejoice,’ there’s no better song to leave an evening with. ‘Hava Nagila’ tells us who we should be and what we, in a fundamental sense, aspire to be — peoples of love and joy and peace.” —Harry Belafonte",
