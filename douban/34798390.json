    "introduction": "Dan Bell takes viewers on a tour of a few main places and interviews several people who were a part of serial killer Aileen Wuornos' final months of life outside prison. Following a vehicle breakdown while returning to his MD hometown, Dan stays in the room where Aileen once lived with her girlfriend Ty. Their time in Port Orange and the events surrounding it formed the basis for the Oscar winning film \"Monster\". Documenting not only the motel room, but the area where Aileen was raped by the first man she murdered as well as the bar she frequented and the place where police apprehended her for her crimes, this film provides a true life look at the town where the events occurred. The interviews with local residents who knew Aileen provide further information about the woman behind the crimes.",
