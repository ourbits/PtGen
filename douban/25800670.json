After receiving a message from 'Clowns UK' (the governing body for clowns) that they are reviewing his clowning license, Bonzo decides this may be his last chance to prove to himself, the authorities and the local community that he can be the clown he once was and decides to get his business back, taking on Mr. Fernelli in the ultimate 'Clown Off.' But as he sets on his path, his addiction haunts him at every turn and he finds that sometimes even when you win, you really lose.",
