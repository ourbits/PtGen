    "introduction": "Ludo Van Alphen, a member of the Green Party, wanders with his flock of sheep in the industrial outskirts of Antwerp’s harbour. Raising livestock has similar demands across the world: the animals need a place to graze. Ludo was an educator at an institution for people with intellectual disabilities before deciding to change his life. The film reflects on his current life and the society in which he lives. A sort of detour in the director’s filmography, the film dwells on the relationship between humans and nature. “This urban nomad story is a meeting point of the modern and the old without bitterness.” (Lehmuskallio)源自：https://doclisboa.org/2023/en/filmes/shepherd/",
