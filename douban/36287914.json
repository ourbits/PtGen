    "introduction": "The first of the new “Lord of the Rings” movies in the works at Warner Bros. will be released in 2026, Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav announced on Thursday, adding that script development is underway. Original “Lord of the Rings” masterminds Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens will be producing “and will be involved every step of the way,” according to Zaslav.Jackson, of course, directed the original “Lord of the Rings” trilogy as well as a trilogy of films based off of earlier J.R.R. Tolkien novel “The Hobbit,” the last of which was released in 2014.Zaslav did not reveal who’s working on the script for the new movie, but Jackson, Walsh and Boyens wrote the original “Lord of the Rings” movies and the prequel trilogy “The Hobbit.”This winter, Warner Bros. will release “The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,” an animated feature whose visual style takes its cues from the live-action films. It stars Brian Cox and Miranda Otto, who is reprising her role from the “Lord of the Rings” film series. The movie is set 200 years before “The Hobbit” and 261 years before “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.”",
