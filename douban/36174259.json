    "introduction": "In 2010, thousands of people protested in Victoria British Columbia about the impacts open net pen fish farming is having on wild salmon populations. But director Scott Renyard discovers the impacts are much worse and include many, if not all, species of fish. Open net pen fish farms provide ideal conditions for the amplification of parasites and diseases, leading to widespread crashes of wild fish populations in the North Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. These large scale reductions in wild fish populations have, in turn, impaired the food chain from fixing carbon in the oceans, making open net pen fish farming a critical part of the climate change puzzle. The Pristine Coast explores how public policy decisions taken and not taken have led to this dilemma, and the rising tide of concern among those who value sustainability and stewardship in the oceans as much as on land.",
