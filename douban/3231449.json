    "introduction": "A dancer and choreographer of genius, Vaslav Nijinski is now recognized as one of the fathers of Western modern dance. His artistic legacy continues to inspire dancers, choreographers and researchers. This documentary of creation proposes to show in what way and especially for what reasons Diaghilev (lover, Pygmalion and impresario of the dancer) was somehow appropriate Nijinski, favoring first the hatching of his extraordinary talents, then the abandoning to the psychic debacle, consequence of his schizophrenia.",
