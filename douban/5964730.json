When he falls asleep, his troops are gone and he is left alone to defend the incoming enemy invasion. Flashbacks recall his wartime experiences and his transition from a human being into a sadistic murderer and rapist. He encounters a prostitute and a giggling girl in this violent feature that reveals the deterioration of human values in the face of the grim realities of war.",
