    "introduction": "Hubert Wolfe, a successful author who hasn't written anything for 10 years, is living a life of lies. He uses a ghostwriter named Dany- a prolific writer known for his genuineness of spirit as well as his antisocial behaviour- to write his novels. When Dany's life falls apart and he is no longer able to write, Hubert turns to another writer, Quentin, a soft-hearted man with a pure soul. Their personal quests lead them into a series of unexpected situations and in a troubling world in a lost corner of the United States, far from their usual stomping grounds. In this strange land, each man begins to discover who he truly is and ultimately to rewrite his own life.",
