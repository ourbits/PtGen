    "introduction": "At a time when Shah Abbas I Safavi has just ascended to the throne with the support of Qazalbash leaders and a coup against his father and still has no established power and position, the country is in a chaotic situation politically and socially, and in addition to the threats and encroachments of the colonists to Iran's soil, some people inside the country have the claim of Iran's government. Sadr al-Din Mohammad Qavam Shirazi, nicknamed Mullah Sadra, steps on the path of acquiring knowledge. This prominent philosopher, who has a spirit of thirst and eagerness to learn, studies in the presence of great Islamic scientists and scholars such as Sheikh Bahai, Mirdamad, and Mirfendersky.",
