Muniammah, a flower seller, has an 11 year-old daughter, Uma, who dreams of becoming a dancer. However her dream remains far from coming true. Instead of going to dancing school, she has to deliver flowers on her bicycle. Muniammah expects her son Siva to help earn money for the family but what he earns at the car wash, he is saving up to buy a motorcycle. One day, Siva goes on a drive in a luxurious car of a client and crashes it. In order to pay for the damage, he ends up becoming a pick-pocket. What saves him from the moment of crime and corruption is his family whose ties had seemed loose. He decides to spend the money he saved up for his motorcycle for Uma’s dance lessons. As the brother and the sister ride the bicycle together away from the screen, the director’s intention is clear that in family relationships, sacrifice and consideration aren’t far from each other and that family is the hope they can depend on.
