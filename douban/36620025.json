    "introduction": "We follow madcap Zizi and her absurd attempts to abate trauma, isolation, and self-doubt with a social media account dedicated to marbled smoothies. But first, she has to patch things up with her roommate, a table lamp, spend some time with her imaginary boyfriend, and, well, actually be able to leave her apartment without having a nervous breakdown. Zizi chokes on her third attempt to get into a ride share car, crawling back home to ask her snake plant the million dollar question - is she actually a loser? It's time to go back to the drawing board, or in this case, her social media feed, where Zizi's pattern clash identity and magic crush powder smoothies merit emoji hearts. But, when fans of social media account befriend her in the real world, can Zizi unhinged keep it all together?",
