In this fantastic story of potions and pandemonium, Dr. Jekyll, famed English scientist, embarks on an experiment to extract the evil from within himself, accidentally splitting his personality into two and creating Mr. Hyde—a powerful monster whose blood-lust terrorizes the city of London every night and baffles the police in the morning. When Dr. Jekyll wakes up from Mr. Hyde ’s evil rendezvous, he realizes he must figure out how to stop the beast and reunite the two sides that are battling for his body and soul.",
