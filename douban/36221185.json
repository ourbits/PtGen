    "introduction": "The film opens with a striking image: seven children in rags, aged 7 to 19, crawl out from under a Brazzaville market stall where they have spent the night. Moussa Touré picks up with them there and then continues to film as they go about their business in the city, looking for food and odd jobs. Taking advantage of his closeness to the children, the filmmaker sets out to take each back to his family. But the road back is beset with difficulties that exemplify the state of Congolese society.",
