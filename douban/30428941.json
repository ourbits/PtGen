    "introduction": "For Alyssia and Ilaria, every farewell is also a reunion. Just a while ago they were at the Italian Mediterranean coast, now here they are standing at a parking lot in front of an Esso gas station, waiting for their father’s car to appear around the corner. Affectionately, they bid their mother good-bye for now. The two sisters’ parents are separated. Just like Carleton, Sherazade and Thomas, the two girls have found their own way of dealing with the situation. Swiss documentary filmmaker Jacqueline Zünd takes plenty of time for her portraits of five very different protagonists, who have perhaps grasped more quickly than the adults that you don’t have to live together to be father and mother.",
