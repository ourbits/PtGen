    "introduction": "During the pandemic, we found ourselves cooking more at home and stumbled upon the intriguing concept of \"Food Design.\" This led us on a fascinating journey, where we began delving deeper into the world of food. We discovered that food is far more than just sustenance-it's both fundamental yet incredibly complex, leading to a lot of interesting questions: What exactly is food? How does it connect to our lives? How can we design it? How can food transcend into a medium of creativity and not just fuel for our body? We hope our film doesn't just make you feel hungry, but hungry for creativity with a fresh perspective on food.",
