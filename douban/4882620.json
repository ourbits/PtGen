    "introduction": "Matěj works for a farmer and is in love with his boss’s daughter, Majdalenka. But the greedy man drives him out. Matěj makes his way as far as the royal castle, where a grand contest is being held for the hand of Princess Rozmarýna. Whoever solves three riddles will have her hand in marriage. Matěj is a clever lad, and the princess’s tasks are as easy as pie for him. The king grows fond of the bright young man but, to the general, the lady-in-waiting and the steward, Matěj just means trouble. Particularly when he befriends the courageous and honest soldier Ondra, who is secretly in love with Princess Rozmarýna. They devise a trap which will rid them of Matěj. But he, with the aid of his friend Ondra, uncovers all their tricks. The princess finally realises who truly loves her and, as a result, also solves the “loveliest riddle”. Matěj, however, is keen to set off back home to his beloved Majdalenka...",
