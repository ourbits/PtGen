    "introduction": "Teresa, also known as Ti, put herself in real trouble this time, and her mum decides to \"exile\" her to grandma house for the entire Christmas break. In the complete boredom of the countryside during winter, only two things can rescue her: her little cousin Alice and the Martians that Ti brings to life with her made-up stories. She finds herself able to bend the time: the seconds, sets by the pendulum clock, become martian days, and her adult life becomes a time travel back to her childhood to better understand her own life.",
