    "introduction": "“Children. As Time Flies” is the third film in Thomas Heise’s “Jammed”-Trilogy about families from Halle-Neustadt, Germany. Now the director focuses on one family: Jeanette and her two sons Paul and Tommy, her parents and her youngest brother Tino. Everybody seems to go their own way: Jeanette finally has a daughter, a lasting relationship and the job as a bus driver she always wanted. Paul shines in school and football while his brother Tommy rather fights his way through life and struggles with staying in school. He broke all contact with his mother. Jeanette’s parents moved to the countryside and communicate rarely with their daughter. With them lives Tino, who identifies as Nazi but can’t talk to his father about it. Yet he regularly meets with Tommy. Today’s footage is intercut with material from 1999 and creates a picture of speechlessness and stagnation. In its cool black and white images “Children. As time flies.” explores the situation of society today. How do you live?",
