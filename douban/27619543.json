    "introduction": "A Very Royal Wedding celebrates the 70th anniversary of The Queen and Prince Philip’s marriage in November 1947.Presenter Alexander Armstrong discovers how a battered post-war Britain pulled off the wedding of the century against the odds.This feature-length documentary includes contributions from Joan Collins and Sheila Hancock, sharing their memories of the wedding, as well as revealing insights from those who were part of the big day, such as page boy Prince Michael of Kent.This was “the people’s wedding” and Alexander will meet the ordinary people who made this such a special occasion, including one of the seamstresses responsible for the spectacular wedding dress.Alexander will also see up close recreations of The Queen’s exquisite 3-carat diamond engagement ring, her beautiful wedding bouquet and her show-stopping 9ft high, 500lb wedding cake.The film features stunning colour archive of the wedding as well as The Queen’s private home movie footage of the day.",
