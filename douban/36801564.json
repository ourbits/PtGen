    "introduction": "Equipped with a humble shovel, Canadian artist Victor Pilon accomplishes the unimaginable by moving 300 tons of sand during a physical and psychological performance lasting over 180 hours in the heart of the Montreal Olympic Stadium. Inspired by Albert Camus’ The Myth of Sisyphus, this acclaimed tour de force is beautifully captured in a special film that emotionally reminds us that behind every human tragedy lies a journey as liberating as it is redemptive. A masterful achievement befitting a spectacular performance, accompanied by the music of the Montreal electro-minimal group Dear Criminals.源自：https://lefifa.com/en/catalog/sisyphe",
