    "introduction": "All it takes is picking up the phone, dialing a number, and in barely half an hour, you'll have a guy in a red outfit standing at your doorstep with a pizza in his hand. Who's that guy bringing us dinner to go with a SuperBowl or Champion's League soccer game on TV or the latest Blu-ray blockbuster? In FOUR SEASONS, such a guy is Mario, a film geek, love addict and college drop-out with a less-than-impressive resume, who's facing an identity crisis at the end of his twenties while living with his grandpa. Mario delivers pizzas. He's one of the many surviving off his tips by working at Pizzicato, a pizza shop owned by one nasty, sleazy boss and the kind of place you would only dare order food from at gun-point. However, Pizzicato is also the setting for this humble, little big tale of delivers to strange clients and of young people searching for love, friendship, and their place in life. Between each pizza delivery, we will get to know the tale of Pizzicato and its wonderful workers over the span of one year. Throughout all for seasons, where we'll laugh and be moved by the little things that make up the world of the staff. We'll meet the French chef, the absent-minded Hindu delivery man with an ace or two up his sleeve. Also the corner prostitute, Lina the shy phone operator. Especially Mario, our hero, who's fallen hard for Mariona -an Audrey Hepburn look-alike- after bringing her a pizza that will change both of their lives. Mariona is our girl.",
