    "introduction": "Katherine Emerson, an Iowa girl hungry for the good things in life, leaves her small hometown and sets out for New York. En route, she is involved in a train wreck in which another woman is killed. Katherine finds the woman's purse and, among its contents, discovers an invitation for the woman to spend 6 months in an unoccupied luxury apartment in Manhattan. Katherine seizes this opportunity and sets up housekeeping in the elegant suite, living well and dressing in the newest fashions. Her family appears unexpectedly, and Katherine tells them that she is married to Nicholas Wentworth, the apartment's owner. Mother Emerson, disturbed that Nicholas is not living with his \"wife,\" writes to him in Europe and asks him to return. Nicholas arrives unexpectedly and is highly amused at Katherine's predicament, taking every opportunity to make her miserable. Katherine finally decides to tell her family the truth, but she is forestalled when Nicholas, who has decided that she would make a good wife, asks her to marry him.",
