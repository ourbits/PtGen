    "introduction": "In one of the most hostile places on Earth, the Outback Opal Hunters return for a ruthless 7th season, braving new frontiers in an industry facing total annihilation.Last season, as a new generation of miners rallied, cataclysmic weather put dedication to the ultimate test as once-in-a-generation flooding drowned the Australian Outback. Mines and partnerships disintegrated, and ambitious targets sunk beneath the waters.This season, brutal government shutdowns and opal scarcity force miners to work deadly ground, risking it all to revive a dying industry. In the face of extinction, the opal hunters must adapt or perish, gambling on untested partnerships, equipment, and techniques to pry from the earth the queen of all gems.Production company: Prospero Productions",
