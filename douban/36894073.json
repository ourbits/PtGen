    "introduction": "The film presents the perspective of David Perlov, then a young man of 32, on old age. To the tune of an old music box, Perlov reflects on the past and present of the residents in a Netanya nursing home, showing their humanity with no embellishments. It is an empathetic yet unsentimental visual portrayal of the challenges of time nearing its end.This film has been remastered by the Jerusalem Cinematheque Film Archive and made publicly available as part of a digitization project initiated by The Ministry of Culture and Sport, The Israel Film Service, and The Ministry of Heritage.",
