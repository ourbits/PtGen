It tells about the wife of a Polish nobleman banished to Syberia, who finds herself in front of a tough choice: either adhere to the ethical code and follow her husband into exile, or divorce him and stay put. Nobody actually wants her to go, besides she doesn’t love her husband very much, so she finally decides to stay, but after 20 years that decision doesn’t seems all that smart anymore…",
