    "introduction": "A 65-year old man named Cărturan lives a quiet life in a mountain village with his 12-year old grandson whom he has raised alone since the boy was little.Unfortunately, a visit to the doctor brings dire, unexpected news: due to a serious illness that he knew nothing about, he will not live much longer.The old man visits his neighbors and close friends Saveta and her daughter Ana.He tells them the news and asks if they would adopt the boy. But the women refuse and they have very strong reasons for that.Then he reveals his intention to organize a remembrance service while he is still alive. Saveta tries to advise him against this unchristian idea, but she fails. This less known practice will cause disagreement between Cărturan and the local pries, who has a different opinion about how these things should be done.",
