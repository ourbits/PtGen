    "introduction": "Eminent son of the 20th century, a poet as feisty in his beliefs as in his dissents, René Depestre was close to the most prominent political and literary personalities of this century. This film shows him in the company of his Haitian countrymen as well as with Pablo Neruda, Jorge Amado, Aimé Césaire, Léopold Sédar Senghor, Edouard Glissant and Ho Chi Minh, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, as he tells us about his political and literary struggles, celebrates love, sex, the female body and his erotic safaris. We discover a 90-year-old rebel searching for eternity, at the top of his poetic art, with the brilliance of a great writer who dreams of living in \"the great house of the humanities",
