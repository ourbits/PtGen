    "introduction": "In the heart of Africa, a new era is dawning. Rwanda is one of Africa's smallest nations and it's is heading towards an important milestone - it's about to receive its first resident lion pride in twenty-five years.Two and a half decades ago a brutal civil war ripped through the country, killing close to two million people and wiping out its most iconic wildlife. Even the great predators vanished from the landscape. The wilderness turned into farmland and the plains fell silent. Rwanda has worked hard to recover from the atrocities of war; it's regained its peace...and rejuvenated its wildlife. Today the wild plains are flourishing and great herds of antelope thrive once more. It's a garden of Eden for any herbivore, but there's still one thing missing...lions.",
