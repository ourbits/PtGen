Many important art objects and installations of Yoko's are seen as the camera goes along with Yoko and John through the installations.Allen Ginsberg and George Maciunas were among two of many guest artists who participated in the exhibition. At the end a &quot;piano piece&quot; by Yoko in which people including John and Yoko are just hitting continuously the surface of a closed piano is over- whelming.",
