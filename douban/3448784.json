    "introduction": "Fine Powder is an extraordinary film in more than one sense—even though it’s considered to be one of the precursors of the New Argentine Cinema of the ‘90s, it is practically impossible to determine what it resembles, as well as finding heirs to it. Like many films of the time, Esteban Sapir’s first feature gives voice to a youth without a future in the midst of a collapsed country. But it does so in an infrequent way—inventing its own language, evading the unwritten rules of cinematic syntax. We are in the antipodes of the realism that characterizes a good part of the filmmakers of its generation—Sapir doesn’t seek to reflect the crisis of its main character in a mimetic manner, but refracts it through an audiovisual language that is also shattered, turning fragment, artifice and editing into its weapons, with an unbreakable faith in cinema as opposition to existential vacuum.源自：https://www.mardelplatafilmfest.com/38/en/pelicula/picado-fino",
