    "introduction": "The Writer follows the intimate story of two 60-year-old queer men reconnecting after 30 years. Kostas (Bruce Ross) and Dima (Jamie Day) met serving in the Soviet army in the 1980s, and Dima joined Kostas in moving from Russia to Lithuania. But after Lithuania gained its independence in the 1990s, Kostas left to study in New York, leaving Dima behind. Kostas, now an author, has published a book based on a fictionalised story of their separation. Upon reading it, Dima pays him a visit, eager to correct a few facts.",
