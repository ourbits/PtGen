Smith, who invites him to a recreational resort for those who wish to die, the Thanatos Palace Hotel. Borchter, the proprietor, tells Mr. Manners that he can stay for as long as it takes to become comfortably ready for death. He meets a beautiful guest, Ariane Shaw, who has resided at the hotel for six months, providing services for her room and board. Her service is the romancing of male guests in preparation for their deaths. With Manners, for the first time, she finds a reason to live, as does he.",
