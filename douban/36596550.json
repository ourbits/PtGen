    "introduction": "Randy Schoenberg is fascinated by genealogical research. The American lawyer and grandson of the great composer Arnold Schönberg is almost obsessed with the history of his Jewish family. Randy's research leads him to the gravesite of his oldest known ancestor, Fioretta. In his documentary film, director Matthew Mishory accompanies Randy and his son Joey on their life-defining journey of discovery, which spans 500 years. Impressive footage of their expedition through Venice, Prague and Vienna and the in-depth examination of music, art and Jewish history make FIORETTA a beautiful revelation with a distinctly meditative character. The screening on October 5 is followed by a Q&A with the filmmakers and a live string performance of composer Arnold Schoenberg's Verklärte Nacht (Transfigured Night) by the Zurich Sextet.源自：https://zff.com/en/movies/fioretta",
