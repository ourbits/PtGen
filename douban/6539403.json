    "introduction": "A film which tells the story of the discovery of a suitcase containing 4,500 negatives taken by famous photographers such as Robert Capa, Gerda Taro and David “Chim” Seymour, who here presented their personal testimonies of the different faces of the civil war in Spain. Three story lines depict the journey of the negatives from France to Mexico and trace the role Mexico played in the civil war and its significance for refugees from Spain, whose descendants subsequently became Mexican citizens. The film also examines the attitude of today’s young generation of Spaniards towards the fate of their ancestors who lost their lives in the civil war.",
