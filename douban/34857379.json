Detectives who worked the case recount their investigation step by step, revealing shocking discoveries that deepen the mystery at every turn. As suspects are identified and hours, minutes and seconds of the victim's last day slowly come to light, a window of missing time appears. Investigators use everything from surveillance footage to credit card statements to GPS data to piece together the rest of the timeline and solve the murder.",
