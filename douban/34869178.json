But a taste of hunger is building in Maggie. A hunger that must be fed.DIRECTORS' STATEMENTWith every step the viewer takes in this VR experience - the surroundings - the scene - the characters change. It’s like a narrative soaked in Quantum physics - the viewer will actively change and transform the very scene they observe just by observing it. They can’t control anything except how they sit in front of the screen. So I find the challenge of letting the audience explore my cinematic reality and eventually become ‘someone’ in it - exhilarating. In many ways it questions the very nature of the concept of cinema - and therefore it’s essential to explore it.",
