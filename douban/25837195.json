    "introduction": "Amitabh Bachchan (playing himself) is on his way for a film shooting when his car breaks down. He gets a lift in a bus in which some college students are returning from Mahabaleshwar after a picnic. The students get into a heated discussion, arguing whether man is greater or woman. They put the question to Amitabh. Initially he hesitates to get into such a controversial discussion, especially as he, having gone through various experiences in life, knows that both have equal value. He decides to take his time answering the question. The rest of the movie is about how he handles the sensitive issue and leaves a lasting impression in the minds of the students.",
