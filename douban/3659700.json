    "introduction": "The most surprising thing of all is that the film is actually South African. There's only one reference to that country in the film (very unexpected and funny) and I guess the whole thing is supposed to look like a British or American production.If you know South African attitudes of that time, you would not believe me if I tell you that the film is completely impartial. It gives a chance to laugh at both the American and the Russian without showing the director's true sympathies. The fact that Jamie Uys played the Soviet delegate himself only complicates the matter.But maybe only a cinematographer from a third country - neither American nor Soviet - could be really unbiased at that time. Perhaps, only someone who looked at the conflict between the superpowers from the distance was able to be objective. On the other hand, a South African director did not seem to be a likely candidate - his country was too anti-Communist, too anti-Soviet in 1960s. That only makes Uys's achievement more significant.I suggest that you ignore the silly and unreal setting - it's just a movie, you know. Better relax, sit back in your armchair and enjoy 90 minutes of pure fun. If you're lucky to get a copy of the film, of course ;)",
