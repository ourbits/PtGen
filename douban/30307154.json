    "introduction": "Lotfi, a forty-something Tunisian immigrant, leads the life of a small-time thug in the Noailles neighborhood of Marseille. His daily life is occupied by his home-appliance store and Monique, his French girlfriend, but the past catches up with him when his brother calls from Tunisia to inform him that his wife has had a stroke. Now, Lotfi has to go back home to reclaim custody of his nine-year-old autistic son, Amr, whom he has not seen for six years. Thus begins a journey where Lotfi will face his son, who completely ignores the father he has never known. It is Amr's avoidance of eye contact that drives Lotfi's quest to connect with his son and open him up to the world.",
