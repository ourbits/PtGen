    "introduction": "Gerda and Kristoffer travel to Rome to celebrate their fortieth wedding anniversary in an irresistible film that pays homage to art, love, and the eternal city.They are a somewhat mismatched couple – Kristoffer is gruff and practical, Gerda is sensual and inquisitive. Nevertheless, they love each other, and have done so for 40 years. But when the seniors run into Gerda's old art school teacher at a restaurant, the fluids of youth begin to flow. Bodil Jørgensen, Rolf Lassgård, and Kristian Halken perform a love triangle about rekindled passion and revealed life lies with passion, musicality, and quite a bit of grappa. Meeting in Rome is also a love letter to Rome's film history, containing perhaps the most romantic Vespa ride since Gregory Peck escorted Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday and the most scandalous Trevi Fountain scene since Anita Ekberg took a dip in La Dolce Vita.源自：https://program.goteborgfilmfestival.se/en/program/rom",
