    "introduction": "Edward Dunstan is an artist obsessed by his muse. Every photograph and every movie conveyed the same meaning: What he wanted to see. His muse waited in vain for him to see her as she was, but he could not. And so, like the mermaid in his latest movie who grew legs and left him, so does his muse. For months his days and nights are filled with watching her on the screen. His anger turns to self-pity... turns to acceptance... Only now does he understand what he put her through. When his latest letter to her is returned, he binds himself in chains and climbs into the very tank of water his muse spent many unhappy hours.",
