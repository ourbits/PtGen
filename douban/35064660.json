    "introduction": "This live action, improvisational style movie was filmed in just 12 hours and is sure to delight Zombie fans around the world. Zombie Doomsday is more of an actual live scenario than a low budget independent feature film. It's a very intriguing look at what would happen if there was an actual Zombie outbreak. The concept was developed two weeks before filming and on set production was completed in under 12 hours. The actors were put in a restaurant understanding that a down on his luck movie star was coming back to his hometown to film a reality show. We then set up real events (unknown ahead of time to the actors) that would help carry the story. Some events turned out scary to them while other events were comedic. This film is part \"Zomedy,\" and part scary movie.",
