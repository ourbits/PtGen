    "introduction": "In the suburbs of Rome, two disparate lives with only desire for vengeance and redemption in common find their destinies intertwined. Massimo’s mind is plagued with images of his wife’s violent death at the hands of a criminal gang involved in the production of snuff films. With every memory of the woman he loved replaced by unforgettable images of her horrific final moments, Massimo sees only one chance to take back his life: find the wealthy individual who commissioned the sickening murder – and make them pay. Barabba, a recently released convict, hopes to keep a promise he made to his father and start a new life with his brother, Spaccio, far from the violent world that they used to inhabit. Discovering that his brother is involved in the snuff gang, Barabba seeks to change things the only way he knows how: through violence and bloodshed.Infidus is a dark crime and revenge drama about two people whose lives were permanently changed for the worse, looking to change their sad destiny. Necrostorm movies stories and acting are pretty simple, and are only the background of top quality action and gore. But this time, the acting and the story play a very important role, and both are made very well (probably because the actors are real criminals) Infidus have tons of gory scenes, but it's not entertaining, it's just disturbing... like in real life. Everything is this movie is gritty and uncomfortable, also sequences that are not visually disturbing, are in some way uncomfortable. The houses, the streets, and everything doesn't looks like the Rome you see as tourist: everything is dark and dirty, and the entire city looks like an huge junkyard. The soundtrack and the B\\W photography, constantly give you the feeling there is no hope for the protagonists, and vengeance won't change their faith. And this is Good, because this movie is about crime and vengeance, and they are not cool like in Hollywood movies. Like in real life, Infidus vengeance is just an unstoppable train that runs with blood on a \"dead end\".",
