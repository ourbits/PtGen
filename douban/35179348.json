Frustrated Brazilian TV Journalist Lara has been sent on a \"nonsense mission\" to the heart of the English countryside with Yossi, a war-torn Cameraman, to discover the truth about these mysterious formations. There they meet long-term investigator, the elusive and broken Hatter, desperate to reconnect with his son Dean. Only the local barmaid Aideen seems to know the truth about this clandestine world, but if she does she's in no hurry to tell.

The answers are written into the ground...",
