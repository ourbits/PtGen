    "introduction": "When I was editing my last film, ANIMALS RUNNING (link), a collection of images grouped themselves together but refused to be included in the film. I spliced them together and put them aside. At the same time I was experimenting with sound loops, inspired by John Lilly's work with dolphin language. Briefly, he discovered that when exposed to a repeating loop in a relaxed atmosphere, a subject would begin to hear sounds or words other than those recorded. I made some loops and found that the phrase \"the struggle of the meat\" was a particularly evocative one.THE STRUGGLE OF THE MEAT is a collection of accumulating images in sync with this phrase.Produced with the assistance of the Royal Belgian Film Museum and Agfa-Gevaert.",
