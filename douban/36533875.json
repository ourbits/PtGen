    "introduction": "At Grandpa William’s house, preparations are underway for a big wedding. Sixteen-year-old Jippie, brother of the bride, is getting ready for a musical performance – and unexpectedly falls for a new neighbour.Everyone’s buzzing with excitement about the party. Jaap Peter – or Jippie, as his friends call him – wants to surprise the newlyweds with a few songs, though not everyone is thrilled about his party playlist. On top of that, he’s doing his best to impress Lily, the kind girl next door. And he’s not the only one dealing with emotional fireworks: his sisters are feeling butterflies of their own, Gail and Bart are anxious about a life-changing decision, and Grandpa William ends up injured. Will he recover in time for the wedding? Probably not this time – but thanks to mutual support and understanding, an unforgettable evening awaits them all.",
