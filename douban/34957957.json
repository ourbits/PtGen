    "introduction": "Luise Rainer: Live from the TCM Classic Film Festival is a TV special starring Robert Osborne, Luise Rainer, and Mikael Sharafyan. 100-year-old Oscar-winning actress Luise Rainer sits down with Robert Osborne at the 2010 TCM Classic Film Festival.A few months after her 100th birthday, two-time Oscar winner Luise Rainer joins Robert Osborne onstage at the first annual TCM Classic Film Festival in April 2010. Rainer discusses her brief Hollywood career, including her Oscar-winning portrayal of a Chinese farmer's wife in THE GOOD EARTH (1937) and her thoughts about co-star Paul Muni and MGM boss Louis B. Mayer. Rainer explains her philosophy on acting, an art form she takes very seriously (she was never interested in simply being a \"star\"). She even touches upon her two marriages and the effects of growing old (her hearing aid had broken and Osborne had to write out his questions on a pad of paper).",
