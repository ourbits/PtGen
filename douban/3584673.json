    "introduction": "Children of divorce are forced to deal with two sets of authority figures when their parents remarry. Seen from the perspective of the children, boys from each family observe the changes in their lives during visits to two different homes. An older boy gets excited over his young and beautiful stepmother. Another woman bemoans her economic fate when she loses her mind and marries a musician in this unusual family comedy drama. She goes from her high-energy ex-husband to a much-too-laid-back type, as the eternal search for happiness continues.Yugoslavian director Kreso Golik made documentaries and feature films, as well as television plays. Golik began his career as a sports reporter for Radio Zagreb and gained early experience as an amateur filmmaker. As a professional, Golik made a few short documentaries between 1948 and 1968; he made his first feature, Plavi 9/The Blue 9, in 1950. He has also lectured on film direction at Zagreb's Academy of Theater, Film, and Television since 1979.His melodramatic comedy films Imam dvije mame i dva tate (I Have Two Mums and Two Dads, 1968) and Tko pjeva zlo ne misli (He Who Sings Means No Harm, 1970) were the pinnacle of his career, humorously depicting the Zagreb middle class under communism and between the world wars, respectively. Those two films (especially the latter) have been regularly included among the top 10 Croatian films of all time, both by critics and audiences. \"He Who Sings...\" is considered as most popular film about Zagreb, and it's popularity was so huge that fast-food chain held the name of the characters of the movie.",
