    "introduction": "The film’s central hero is the Minister of Industrial Development, Costas Kavvadias, who finds himself caught in a twofold crisis. The first is personal and concerns his wife, Irini, who is in a bad psychological state and has attempted suicide. The second is political and concerns a dangerous leakage of toxic substances from a chemical factory located in his electoral constituency. A group of inhabitants of the area, led by his old comrade in the party, Dr. Mihalis Liaskos have converged on the village demanding action. The police are afraid of sabotage by terrorists – old friends of Kavvadias’ – with the participation of his wife.",
