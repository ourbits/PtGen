With good looks, an elite circle of friends and a posh NYC apartment, Lisa and Brittney Gastineau live a life that many would envy. Despite their pampered appearance, they are both a few glittering short accessories short of their dream lives. E! cameras follow the ladies as they search for fame, fortune, romance, and the perfect man.",
