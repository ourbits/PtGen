    "introduction": "The ocean, a force of nature, holds wonders and rich ecosystems. However, its resilience is continually eroded by human activity. In this sequel to the film EARTH SEEN FROM THE HEART (2018), the filmmakers invite us to discover and understand the marine environment's adaptability, as well as the threats it faces in the context of a climate crisis. Rich in insights from experts, environmental activists, explorers, and fishermen, this documentary is both a tribute to life and a warning about the impact of our ecological footprint.",
