His elder brother's wife, who has raised him as if he were her own child, asks her husband for permission to spend a single night with the young man and teach him the pleasures of the flesh, out of motherly mercy. However, the following day, an official decree is issued to ban suicide through fidelity... The first-ever digital print of this ambitious work that was the first period film to emerge from the Shochiku New Wave.",
