Together with Arnel, 12, who dreams of returning to his home in Bosnia, he shoplifts in department stores and mugs passersby in expensive shopping streets. Everything changes when Paule robs 18-year-old Julia and falls in love with her. He follows her and gives her back the things he stole from her, pretending to be older than he really is. The girl, who has enjoyed a sheltered upbringing, soon feels equally attracted to Paule, his cheeky charm, and the exciting world he inhabits. But when Arnel is tortured by his cousin's gang and severely injured, she realizes how dangerous and alien that world is. Paule, too, is drawn ever deeper into the conflict between his old life and the life he dreams of. Paule puts up a struggle, but in the end this conflict leads him into a catastrophe with fatal consequences.",
