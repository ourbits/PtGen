    "introduction": "\"He Flew Ahead\" is the unconventional, polyphonic portrait of an extraordinary personality. Karl Schwanzer was an architect of world renown, a visionary, artist, legend, teacher and poet. He understood architecture as an instrument to bring people joy. Nicholas Ofczarek in the role of the architect shows Schwanzer's masterful talent and also that true, virtuoso lightness draws from the mysterious depths of the soul, into which no one ventures without danger.",
