She's the only one who doesn't seem to enjoy the trappings of modern free youth and avoids parties, but is charmed by Josh, a more mature young intellectual, who shows her the simple joys of modernity. They become lovers, but unlike Isaac, she doesn't simply stay behind but insists to part properly with her family and Samual. Once home, she finds it too hard, so after weeks, during which only Samual finds out she's pregnant and offers to pretend being the father, Josh comes demand a decision.",
