    "introduction": "A documentary that takes an innovative look at experimental music and the people who make it. Why do we have to renounce music? Why would a talented and skilled musician want to back away from the system that helped him to reach and understand music in the first place? Why would he want to reshape a working absolute into something that is based on personal preference?IMPROMPTU is an experimental concert film about people, who have dived deep into improvisational music and explore its vast possibilities by breaking notes in tiny splinters. They believe that their music can be the acoustic reincarnation of a soul. Participants in the film include a number of prominent experimental musicians from across the world.",
