After being brutally attacked by the ranch's owner and posse, TOM escapes the ranch and hill's mysterious power- only to be trapped in the surrounding town. The problem is, TOM DIGBY cannot stop digging. And the town and its bizarre residents keep drawing him into the hill's larger conspiracy- with a retired Bureau agent at its core. TOM learns that he might be the latest in a series of land surveyors destined to vanish on the ranch and hill- and that might be the least of his worries.",
