    "introduction": "Murakami’s film poises the lifelong question of the meaning of happiness to her grandparents and records their response. While her premise is simple, it also probes the relation between the camera and the self. The dividing line between the public and private begins to blur: is she truly filming to let the viewers indulge in her grandparent’s wisdom, or is the camera a way for her to broach these questions on her behalf?",
