    "introduction": "The screenplay for this film is based on the writings of a person suffering from the Alzheimer's disease. The story of Mrs. O. is told through a combination of documentary film footage and her own videos from a hand-held digital camera since she records mini instructions for various daily activities, memories, thoughts and commentaries on various events, trying to prevent forgetting them later in the future. Through the individual story of a gradual memory loss, the film represents a metaphor of the memory loss of the whole society which is trying to forget the past events that determined its current status quo.",
