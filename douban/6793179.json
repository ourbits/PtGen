    "introduction": "After years of living apart from her father, Libby, an introverted, yet sharp-witted, teenager, is sent to live with him in Israel. Her arrival coincides with the outbreak of the Second Lebanon War. Libby quickly discovers that her father, Shaul, is an infantile eccentric, and that he is \"in-between apartments\" (in other words: homeless). Shaul comes up with a creative plan to put a roof over their heads-they pose as refugees from the bombarded Northern region of Israel, and are taken in by an affluent family in Jerusalem.Finally in a \"normal\" household, Shaul and Libby begin to build their father-daughter relationship, but their false identities can't last forever, especially as Libby unleashes teenage fury at the lies permeating her life; those she must tell now, and those she's been fed since childhood.",
