    "introduction": "The little Icelandic village is brimming with stories and if you listen closely it might tell you a few tales. Perhaps the one about the prominent businessman who dreams in Latin and sacrifices a promising career for astronomy and old books. Or perhaps you’ll hear the one about the policeman’s son, a sensitive boy who paints and carves birds and dreams of being an artist. Or maybe the one about the wild, open-air sex with explosive consequences. Or the one about the big rock that can break the finely woven thread running between life and death…Based on the eponymous book by celebrated Icelandic author Jon Kalman Stefansson.",
