    "introduction": "Fajar Suharno was a theater maestro from the 80’s to the 90’s. He was imprisoned because his theater activities were considered against the New Order government. At its peak, he made a show entitled Geger Uwong Ngoyak Macan about the events of crushing people who were considered thugs/criminals (Petrus). The show was held just the day before the massacre took place. This film experimented with bringing together the documentary style with the theatrical stage as well as collaboration between artists in Jogja.",
