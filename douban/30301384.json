    "introduction": "German corporate lawyer Max takes on a job in an Amsterdam real estate firm rather than joining his father's construction company. He's relatively happy, yet doesn't quite fit in with his narrow-minded way of thinking -however hard he tries to relax- in the libertine city. Then he falls in love with Dutch snack-bar owner Sophie, who claims to not be interested in him. Unexpectedly Max's parents invite themselves to come 'celebrate' his birthday with a stuffy dinner in a near-by German restaurant and invade his small apartment. After his father's car crashes into to Sophie's father's bike, conflicting loyalties clash, but deep-rooted commitments win out breeding surprising alliances.",
