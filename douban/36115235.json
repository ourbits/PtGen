    "introduction": "An unexpected moment in a session with a client confronts a psychologist with his own inner world. Alienated by the isolation of his seemingly perfect city life, the psychologist encounters an extreme inability to understand and embrace his own human nature. His inescapable desires for his male client force the psychologist to look at who he does not want to be. It is the only way that he can find out who he really is. EASY TIGER is an intimate portrait of a vulnerable man during a true and insurmountable romance. This author's film examines how the medium of film can be commemorated and used to place physicality as a narrative in front of the lens, and how the same audiovisual work can provide, as much as possible, the same experience for both hearing and non/partially-hearing viewers.",
