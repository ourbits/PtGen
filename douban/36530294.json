    "introduction": "For 30 years, Hwang Munhee has lived near the Wolsong Nuclear Power Plant, which is responsible for half of South Korea's nuclear waste production. After being diagnosed with thyroid cancer and witnessing her grandson's exposure to high levels of radiation, she demands action from both Korea Hydro&Nuclear Power and the government, urging them to develop a relocation plan. Hwang initiates a class-action lawsuit and joins forces with other thyroid cancer patients. The group includes Oh Sunja, who herds goats under the transmission tower of the Wolsong Nuclear Power Plant, and a diver who lives near Daebon Port. Together, they seek accountability from the nuclear power plant and aim to shed light on the radiation issue and its consequences.",
