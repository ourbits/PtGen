Luzia is hoping for a new start in her life with Paul, but is also looking for a way to get closer to Anton, from whom she has been estranged ever since his father’s death. As the harmony between Luzia and Paul increases, Anton is pushed out onto the jagged coastal landscape. It is there that he meets the mysterious, David. David is wild, impetuous and afraid of nothing. He exposes Anton to a world without rules. Anton is fascinated by David, his strength and self-confidence.",
