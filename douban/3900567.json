    "introduction": "\"Flucht in den Norden\" is a somewhat lackluster drama set in Finland in 1934. Johanna is a young woman who has fled Nazi Germany to visit her old university friend Karin at her family's estate in Finland. Quickly, it becomes clear that the two are more than just friends, as they resume what can only be assumed as a recurring love affair.Upon arriving at the friend's family estate, Johanna's anti-fascist views immediately clash with her friend's brother, who is pro-Nazi and the two argue passionately. A second brother proves to be her saving grace, as he shares her own political views. The two begin a heated affair, leaving Olin's character out in the proverbial cold.The two travel north to an Arctic port where they engage in a debate over whether Johanna should stay with him, out of harm's way, or continue to Paris to join the resistance movement.",
