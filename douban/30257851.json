    "introduction": "High School--the crossroads of American adolescence. Five teenagers intersect during a day of court-appointed community service. The empty summer halls of their high school are ground zero for conflict, camaraderie, and collective soul searching. At an age when discovering who you are can be difficult, and knowing who you aren't can be deceptive. The students: Jared was born to rebel, or was he raised to; Sara walks the fine line between woman- and childhood; Aisha walks the fine line between foolish and fearless; Peter finds out firsthand, words and actions have consequences; and Tristan, the young one, has already been branded a killer. These five lives collide, all before breakfast.",
