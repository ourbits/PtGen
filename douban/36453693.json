    "introduction": "For Heidegger, Wiederholung ('repetition/retrieval'), is one of the terms he uses for the appropriate attitude towards the past. 'By the Wiederholung of a basic problem we understand the disclosure of its original, so far hidden possibilities.' In this video, Anastas enters into dialogue with Pasolini's 1963 footage entitled 'Seeking Locations in Palestine for 'The Gospel According to Mathew.'' The film adapts his script and map to the contemporary setting in Palestine, seeking to explore contradictions, disrupts and continuities and therein to reveal previously unnoticed possibilities in the original.",
