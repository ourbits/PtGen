    "introduction": "May 1977. 22-year-old Colleen Stan is hitching from Oregon to California to visit friends. With a little over 40 miles of her journey left, she accepts a lift from a young couple, Cameron and Janice Hooker. It's a fateful decision. Kidnapped at knifepoint, Colleen spends the next seven years imprisoned for up to 23 hours a day in a coffin-sized box hidden beneath her captors' bed. When not incarcerated, she is employed as the Hooker's slave and child-minder, and is gradually drawn into a bizarre and complex world of extreme obsession and fantasy... Based on a true story, GIRL IN THE BOX is a dark psychological drama told through the eyes of one of the crime's perpetrators, Janice Hooker.",
