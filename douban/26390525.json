    "introduction": "He was a wisecracking World War II vet. She was an orphan, his kid sister’s best friend. Harold and Lillian eloped to Hollywood, where they became the film industry’s secret weapons. Nobody talked about them, but everybody wanted them. Theirs is the greatest story never told—until now.Academy Award–nominated director Daniel Raim presents HAROLD AND LILLIAN: A HOLLYWOOD LOVE STORY, a fascinating and deeply moving account of the romantic and creative partnership between storyboard artist Harold Michelson (1920–2007) and his wife, film researcher Lillian Michelson (b. 1928)—a talented and generous couple once considered to be the heart of the industry.For sixty tumultuous years, Harold and Lillian weathered personal and professional setbacks while working on hundreds of films, many of them now classics, including The Ten Commandments, The Apartment, The Birds, Who’s Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?, The Graduate, Rosemary’s Baby, Fiddler On The Roof, Star Trek: The Motion Picture, Scarface, Full Metal Jacket. Although the couple was responsible for some of Hollywood’s most iconic examples of visual storytelling, their contributions remain largely uncredited.Through an engaging mix of love letters, interviews (including candid conversations with Harold and Lillian, Danny DeVito, and Francis Coppola) and film clips, home movies, and rare production art, HAROLD AND LILLIAN lovingly chronicles a remarkable relationship and two extraordinary careers spanning six decades of movie-making history.",
