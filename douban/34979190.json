    "introduction": "Told through the eyes of an Australian television reporter who moved to the UK to escape depression, we learn that sometimes you can find happiness where you least expect. We follow the journey of 3 characters in the club: the lesbian coach fighting misogyny, even in the gay world. The semi-pro player who spiraled into a depression after his coming out didn't go as planned. And the prop who discovered he was a drag queen through the club.",
