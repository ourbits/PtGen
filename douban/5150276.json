    "introduction": "After five years in jail, Leila is free again. Yannick, a young athlete, recently lost his sight in a car crash. The only discipline in which he can compete is running, but he must race tethered to a guide. Before she went to prison, Leila was an elite athlete. She will be Yannick's eyes. Leila keeps quiet about her past. Sick of the sympathy of his family and friends, Yannick welcomes her silence. Training and preparing to race helps them both rebuild their lives. There are past events that won't let go, and present feelings and emotions that bring upheaval and a new direction. But you have to keep running and battling, down the straight to the line.",
