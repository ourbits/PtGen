    "introduction": "The PHD Movie 2 looks at themes of competition in research, writer's block, and finding your voice. The Nameless Grad Student is now an integral part of Prof. Smith's Lab. However, the lab is in peril as research funding levels are at an all-time low. The group must travel to an important academic conference and square off against a rival group as they compete for results and grant money. Meanwhile, Cecilia's advisor is going on sabbatical, which means she has to finish writing her thesis or be stuck in grad school another year.",
