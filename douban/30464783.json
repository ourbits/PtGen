She can also take on anyone, with her sharp wit and repartee. But despite her buddies, her over-protective mom and her brilliant mind, Nour is unhappy. She wishes she could be more feminine and wants dudes to see her as a girl, not a cute brother. Especially since her boyfriend just dumped her for some hot chick Nour is at the end of her rope. Something needs to change.So when Sissi, a Pole Dance instructor offers to teach her for free, Nour grabs the chance to try something new. Coached by Sissi, who believes in her, and supported by her group of friends, Nour gives everything she’s got to the possibility that she too, can be womanly.",
