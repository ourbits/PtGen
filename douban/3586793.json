    "introduction": "This is an uneven, complex comedy by femme director Soja Jovanovic, based on three different stories by the Serbian writer J.S. Popovic. The general idea is universally popular -- a con artist passes himself off as someone he is not and then cheerfully wreaks havoc in a small town. Along the way to chaos, there are several romantic sub-plots that offer their own brand of humor. Though with a wide array of characters, viewers may need a score card to keep track of them.Soja Jovanovic (February 1, 1922 – April 22, 2002) was the first Yugoslavian woman director, noted for her work in theater, TV and film productions.After studying at the Theater Department of the Belgrade Music Academy, her first success was the stage production of Branislav Nusic's play A Suspicious Character (Serbian: Sumnjivo lice) in 1948, for which she was awarded at the Festival of Academy Theaters of Yugoslavia. Apart from theater productions, she also directed a number of films, mostly based on comedies written by Branislav Nusic, Jovan Sterija Popovic, Stevan Sremac and Branko copic.Her first film was A Suspicious Character in 1954 which she co-directed with Predrag Dinulovic. In 1957 she directed Priests cira and Spira (Serbian: Pop cira i pop Spira), which was the first Yugoslavian feature film shot in color and for which she won the Golden Arena for Best Director at the 1957 Pula Film Festival. She also directed a number of TV films and radio dramas produced by Radio Television Belgrade until the early 1980s when she retired.",
