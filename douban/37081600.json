Jacqueline, her sister Helen and her husband Hans are still there, seemingly living in harmony. But Jacqueline has a secret desire to break the routine and get away from it all. One day, as she once again hits the road in her Buick, she runs into a young man, Mark. He takes up residence in the hotel until he recovers. Jacqueline senses that this man could be the one she needs to make a fresh start.",
