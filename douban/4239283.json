    "introduction": "Seidl takes his camera to an abstract-art exhibition and asks the public to comment on what they see. Some analyse the work from a strictly Freudian angle as they nibble their canapés; others can only see penises. In reality, the paintings are simply an excuse for Seidl to unmask the anguishes, fears, suspicions and sexual taboos of the subjects gathered here. The \"public\" includes some of the usual Seidl suspects, look out for Mr. \"Busenfreund\" René Rupnik himself.",
