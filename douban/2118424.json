    "introduction": "Based on the very successful stage play Staromodnaya Komediya (in the U.S. it is known as Do You Do Somersaults?) by Alexander Arbuzov, this romance tells the story of how love develops between two people in late middle age who are somewhat set in their ways. They meet at a seaside resort. Lidia is going to a resort for a vacation. Open-hearted and free-spirited, she came late for a meeting with Rodion, who is the resort's social director. He scolds her, and she leaves angrily, but they see one another enough times, quarrelling as often as not, to discover that they love one another. ~ Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide",
