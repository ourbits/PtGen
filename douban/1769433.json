    "introduction": "At the invitation of the mainland Chinese government, Shirley MacLaine took a contingent of seven American women of multiple races, ages and socioeconomic levels to China for a tour. Accompanied by government guides, these personable women toured Beijing, Shanghai, Canton and Hangchow. Among the highlights: a Caesarian childbirth under acupuncture anaesthesia, farms, homes, schools, and day-care centers. Clearly a propaganda piece, various outrageous claims by officials are made for the wholesomeness of Chinese life. Nonetheless, the film is well-photographed and the individuals involved in the tour are personable and charming.",
