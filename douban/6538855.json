    "introduction": "Rising Scream Queen Victoria DeMare stars in a new horror movie, and raving critics call it 'an all-out camp fest that takes the audience on a ride of thrills, spooks, humor, drama, and everything in between!' When five close college friends get together in an isolated, decrepit mansion for their best friend's wedding, an unhappy ghost disturbs the festivities. Leading the pack is Toni, a stunningly beautiful NYPD cop with dormant psychic abilities. Will the bond she develops with the resident house ghost be strong enough (or even real?) to save hers and her friends' lives in time? Filled with memorable one-liners, unforgettable acting, great special effects, and a haunting, mesmerizing score, \"Deadly Beloved\" delivers on every level, and it will keep you glued to your seat until the ultimate plot twist no one sees coming!
