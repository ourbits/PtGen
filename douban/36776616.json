    "introduction": "The story turns on Lisa (Jansen) a hard-working narcotics officer with anger management issues. Her life falls apart when her husband and colleague Jostein goes missing during a high-profile narcotics case involving drug dealer Marko Stankoviz (Carew). To top it all off, her demented mother, Signe, can’t get a spot in a nursing home and moves in with her.Although everyone around Lisa says Jostein’s disappearance was an accident, she believes it is connected to the Marko case that her husband was investigating. When she witnesses a botched interrogation of Marko himself, led by the “up and coming” officer Aila (Akerlie), Lisa wants to take matters into her own hands. But her boss Ole (Ole Soo) is far from impressed and demotes her.By chance, in her new gloomy work environment, Lisa stumbles upon Shirouh (Josef), a petty criminal wannabe stand-up comedian who has just witnessed a murder and seeks protection at Lisa’ home. Now the two must help each other to help themselves. There is also the eco-friendly solar panel importer Isak (Espen Seim) whom Lisa ads to her list of suspects.",
