Gradually, the process of bringing a book to fruition becomes a very personal and unfettered exploration of her past: of her relationship with her mother; the role of the family home in the south, which seems to have been frozen in time; and how the absence of her father - who disappeared in 1977 during the dictatorship - influenced all of those years.",
