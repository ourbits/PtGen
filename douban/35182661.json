    "introduction": "Ornella (17) has her life radically changed when her parents force her to be exorcised upon the discovery of a series of “wicked” messages Ornella is exchanging with her friend, Laura.Although the family’s moral comfort zone seems to be restored, the young girl begins to suffer a strange illness that makes her days increasingly difficult to bear. Soon, what started as a transitory fever turns into a nightmare, covering Ornella’s entire body with ulcers and scaly spots.As no one seems to care about finding the cause to her unusual ailment, Ornella formulates a theory that is as strange as it is plausible: in order to be able to heal, she must get the Devil to possess her again.",
