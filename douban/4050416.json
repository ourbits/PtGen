    "introduction": "During the 1950s Gabriel García Márquez and Enrique Grau attempted to restart the industry. In 1954 both artists, a writer and a painter respectively created a surrealistic short film \"La langosta azul\" (The Blue Lobster). Garcia Marquez continued in the industry as a scriptwriter while Grau continued painting.A very important movie in Colombian film history. Cepeda Samudio plays havoc with time and classic narration. We can speak barely of argument as we know it usually. We can say either it is surrealistic... With no sound \"the blue lobster\" (la langosta azul) remains as a rare, unique, work of (film)art. Space and time: A town at the coast, frozen in time. Nothing apparently ever happens there and it seems it will never do. Characters: An American, the hotel man, the girl, the cat, the lobster, the wizard and the little boy. As a low budget film (rare for 1954 in Colombia)we can speak proudly of an authentic conception of what a big film industry is and what is not because of local conditions and our respect for local traditions.",
