    "introduction": "Mircea Eliade is a delicate subject for Romania. He died in exile, after achieving huge international esteem as historian of religions. He lived for almost 40 years away from his homeland, and the bad thing is that Romanians haven't missed him until recent years.Dan Pita's film is based on Eliade's novellas \"Mantuleasa St.\", \"At the Gypsies\" and a few others. Bold approach on Eliade's complicated fiction, good performances from Iordache, Mihai Calin, Costel Constantin and others, interesting cinematography but, still, an unfinished script leads to an unfinished film. The ending leaves us with the impression that Pita was just exercising his direction using Eliade's works.",
