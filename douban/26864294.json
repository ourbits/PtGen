    "introduction": "Bruno has tried to forget, but he still carries the scars of his past, on his skin and under, hidden within the creases of his soul and body, like the illness that consumes him slowly. One day Bruno has the chance to go back where everything has began, a disused furnace that became the shelter of a man and his daughter. Neither of them recognizes the intruder, whose intentions appear increasingly more elusive and ambiguous. Bruno must find somebody to hold responsible in order to heal, he must look at the origin of his suffering straight into the eyes, search for traces, erase them, to try to stop the intruder within him.",
