    "introduction": "The Amazing Race 7 was the seventh installment of the popular reality television show, The Amazing Race. This installment ran from March 1, 2005 to May 10, 2005.Filming began on November 20, 2004 and finished on December 19, 2004.In this edition of the race, a change was made to the non-elimination leg penalty. In addition to being stripped of all their money and receiving no allowance for the next leg of the race, teams were forced to surrender all of their possessions, except for their passports and the clothes they were wearing, for the remainder of the race. (This penalty came to be referred to as \"mugging\" by fans.) They were also no longer allowed to beg for money prior to the start of the next leg (after the next leg started, they can beg for money). The racers could also receive or buy clothing or toiletries from other teams.In September 2005, Season 7 won a Primetime Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Reality-Competition Program\", the third consecutive award for the television series. Although Seasons 5 and 6 were also eligible, producers chose Season 7 since it was the most recent installment of the show.The DVD for Season 7 was released on December 20, 2005.Episode titles are often taken from quotes made by the racers.1.Courteous?
