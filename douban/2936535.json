    "introduction": "When the film’s director, Julian Shaw, was 15 years old he saw a show in Sydney that was to change his life. That night, just one entertainer took to the stage – a political satirist from South Africa named Pieter-Dirk Uys. A well-known opponent of apartheid, Uys soon became a dedicated activist against Aids. Uys’ alter ego is Evita Bezuidenhout, South Africa’s ‘most famous white woman’. During his performance in Sydney, Uys railed passionately and with irresistibly dark humour against what he described as the ‘new apartheid’ – for which he held the South African government responsible, because it had abandoned the next generation to fend for itself against the virus, unprotected.",
