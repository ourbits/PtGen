    "introduction": "BBC Two's multi-award-winning Secret History of Our Streets told the story of six London streets, from Victorian times to the present day.Now, as its people stand at a crossroads in their history, the series travels to Scotland to tell the stories of three archetypal streets in Scotland's three great cities: Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen.Endlessly surprising and not at all what you would expect, the stories of these streets are the story of a nation.This is the story of Edinburgh's New Town and the Moray Estate - an area unlike anywhere else in Britain, with an architecture and a people seemingly unchanged over almost 200 years.",
