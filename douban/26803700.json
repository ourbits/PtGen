    "introduction": "Following the success of World’s Busiest Railway 2015, this new three-part series presented by Ade Adepitan, Anita Rani, Ant Anstead and Dan Snow takes viewers to the heart of three iconic public spaces in the city of New York: one of the busiest and most complex metropolises in the world.Filmed as live from Grand Central Terminal, the New Fulton Fish Market and Central Park, the series offers a 360-degree insight into the lives of New Yorkers - how they get about the city, how they are fed, and how they relax.Immersive films will show how transport, commerce, culture, leisure, food and retail play key roles in the life in the city, and the series will take viewers behind the scenes of some of the city’s biggest shops and organisations, as well as deep underground at major engineering projects to tell the story of New York, its people, and its history.",
