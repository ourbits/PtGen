    "introduction": "Austin Wright is a 17-year-old boy whose world is completely rocked when his long-time girlfriend suddenly commits suicide. His troubled past marked by frequent run-ins with the law does not help this small community from pointing their fingers in Austin's direction. Throughout the film, Austin makes attempts at buffering his reputation, but pressure from his mother, his relationship with his felon best friend, and the uncovering of Madison's truths pull Austin back into a black hole of trouble. Will Austin seek redemption for Madison's death, or will the allure of a life on the wild side be his downfall?",
