One day she appears before him, and promises that God will give her a new lease of life if he acts out ‘good’ deeds on earth. Starting with seemingly innocuous acts and progressing in both intensity and malice, the boy follows the orders from his mother’s apparition. His compulsive desire to have her back drives the cruelty of his acts to an extent beyond what anyone thought possible.",
