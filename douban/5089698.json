    "introduction": "About 550 B.C. there reigned in Persia and Egypt, Cambyses, a very cruel and passionate king. He fell in love with Amestris, the beautiful wife of his favorite courtier, Prexaspe. It happened one day that young Masyos, son of Prexaspe and Amestris, was learning how to throw the javelin or spear. Cambyses comes upon the scene and plays with Masyos. Unhappily, as King Cambyses threw the javelin, Masyos ran in front of him so that the javelin pierced him through the heart. Amestris, the boy's mother, did not understand that it was accidental and she swore to avenge Masyos' death. Accordingly, she feigned to yield to Cambyses' passion in order to attract him into her home. There, before the corpse of her dead son, which she tragically displayed to Cambyses, she stabbed the king to the heart with the same javelin with which he had killed Masyos,",
