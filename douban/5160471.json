    "introduction": "Filmed at an anti-war march from Harlem to the United Nations in 1967 on the occasion of Martin Luther King's speech at the U.N in which he questioned the disproportionate percentage of black soldiers in combat in Vietnam. The title is a quote misattributed to Mohammed Ali on why he refused to serve in the war. Four hundred thousand people participated in demonstrations ion New York on that day. On-street interviews with black residents of Harlem are interlaced with the comments of three black soldiers who had recently returned from the war.http://www.renrendianyingwang.cn",
