    "introduction": "The series starts with the events of 1759 in Delhi, during the declining Mughal empire under emperor Shah Alam II. Weakness of the Mughal empire leads to the invasion of Ahmad Shah Durrani and his army faces the Maratha army on 14 January 1761. The cataclysmic defeat of the Marathas in this Third Battle of Panipat lead to the death of 50000 Marathas and many more. Witnessing this defeat, the Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao dies of mental depression. Then the show follows the life of Mahadji Shinde who was gravely wounded in the battle. But soon Maratha Empire, with his help, recovered Maratha power in North India, restoring Mughal emperor's moral authority as Mughal empire came under Maratha protection. He was awarded the title of grand visier by the Mughal emperor. There is a romance between Mahadji and princess Jumna, blossoming into marriage. Mahadji and Indore's queen Ahilya Bai Holkar develop attraction and have a sublime relationship where they help each other. The British are kept in check due to his efforts. The movie ends by depicting a fictional account of Mahadji being poisoned by jealous Maratha subordinates.",
