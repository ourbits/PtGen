    "introduction": "The Lost Army of King Cambyses explores one of the last great mysteries of ancient Egypt. An army of 10,000 Persians vanished in the desert 2,500 years ago while attempting to cross the remote and dangerous Western Sahara. During the 1930s famous explorers, including Count Almeidy the English patient, searched beneath the vast sands of the desert, but the mystery of The Lost Army of King Cambyses remained unsolved; until a few years ago, when photos of a rare arrowhead found in the middle of the Great Sand provided new clues and revived the hunt.",
