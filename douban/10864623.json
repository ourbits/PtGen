    "introduction": "89 Seconds at Alcázar is a single channel looped video inspired by Diego Velasquez' Las Meninas. Treating the scene in the painting as a film still, the Rufus Corporation invented the actions that come before and after the depicted moment as if it were a fleeting gesture that continues as part of the movement of daily life. The camera's 10 minute circumnavigation of the room has no clear beginning, middle or end and was shot as a single fluid choreography.",
