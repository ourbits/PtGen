    "introduction": "In 1519, Malinche is a slave to the Mayans in Tabasco. When the Mayans lose a battle to the newly arrived Spaniards, they give women to them as a tribute of war. Even though Malinche is not picked as one of these women, she sneaks into the group. She hopes slavery under the Spaniards is better than under the Mayans. During the expedition to Tenochtitlan, Malinche notices that the Spaniards are having a tough time communicating with the locals so she offers her services as a translator. She speaks both Nahuatl and Mayan, which completes the language skills of the other translator Jerónimo de Aguilar who speaks Spanish and Mayan. Malinche becomes very important in the negotiations with the different tribes. She tries to use this newly acquired and relative power to negotiate her freedom, so she can finally go back to her hometown.",
