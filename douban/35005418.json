    "introduction": "导演兼编剧 Brian O'Doherty是一位爱尔兰艺术评论家，他是爱德华·霍普的朋友。“Upon Hopper’s death in 1967, eight people came to his funeral。 Artist and author Brian O’Doherty, a longtime friend of Hopper’s, was one of those eight. So when he set out to make a documentary about the artist, he had no desire to transgress Hopper’s silence. Instead, he embraced it. The result was the 1981 film Hopper’s Silence, a meditative visual essay that explores the majestic quiet that characterizes the characters, rooms, and streets in Hopper’s paintings, as well as the artist himself.”https://blogs.getty.edu/iris/listening-to-edward-hoppers-silence/",
