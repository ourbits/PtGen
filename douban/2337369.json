    "introduction": "weaves the stories of seven gay and lesbian couples on their emotional journey to the altar with the dramatic showdown at Massachusetts' constitutional convention, a vivid demonstration of democracy in action that may change the course of history. The film captures all the nuance of what may be the defining chapter in the history of the gay and lesbian struggle for equal rights. SAME SEX AMERICA is a compelling tapestry of interwoven stories set against the backdrop of what is an historic chapter in the history of civil rights in America. Filmmaker Henry Corra treats his subjects with the utmost respect, and the result is a subtle, richly layered film that inspires and entertains while taking the viewer on an unforgettable journey to the heart of the new American family.",
