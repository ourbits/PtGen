So it seems that Lily, who's just come back from the United States and is still ignorant of both Slava's existence and his fame, will get caught in a love trap at some point in time. And just as predicted...she does. But Slava is also helpless against the girl's charms. It looks as though nothing, not even the ocean of overly excited fans, can stand in the way of Lily's and Slava's love. Well, almost nothing...The couple will still have to wrestle with that nasty provision in Slava's contract which denies him the right to marry or be in an official relationship with ANY girl.",
