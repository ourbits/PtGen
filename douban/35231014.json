    "introduction": "Jordan is the second driest country in the world, which is why villages in the vast Wadi Rum desert are dependent on fossil groundwater. Both its inhabitants and the nomadic Bedouin people are facing a water shortage and hope that the kingdom will help them just as it had promised. But only large farms and the seaside city of Aqaba, which the King of Jordan plans on making \"the next Dubai\", have permission for deep drilling. Through a series of interviews and poetic shots of the arid landscape, this ecological documentary captures the state of Jordan in crisis where the last non-renewable water resource is being depleted, as well as the conflict between the local community worried about its future and the government who chooses not to act in their favour.",
