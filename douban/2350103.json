Their attempts to save their marsupial mate route them back to the U.S. into the glitz and glamour of Las Vegas, baby! They also land right in the pouch of a cross-continental jewel heist--and the FBI thinks they're the crooks! To prove their innocence, all they have to do is find the jewels. And to find the jewels, all they have to do is find Jack. Jack in Vegas -- boxing matches, all-night discos, seven-course buffets -- where do you start?! This is a high-stakes adventure the whole family will win on!",
