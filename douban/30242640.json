    "introduction": "In an ideal world law and justice are the same. A criminal commits a crime against a victim and justice makes sure scandals are balanced. The offender gets his punishment and the victim gets compensated for his suffering. Unfortunately, reality is quite different. That is why justice is wearing her blindfold for centuries. Big frauds go free and petty thiefs are handled hard. Offenders walk because of procedural mistakes and victims stand in the cold. Justice can be really unjust. Coppers is about the federal police, seeking for this justice.",
