    "introduction": "Semi-Tropical Romantic Drama. A little town in the Paraná Forrest of Paraguay is the scenario of this dramatic drama.Isabel Sarli is Isabel,the beautiful daughter of poor farmers,who's love for the sordid Quiroga cuts early her life when both fails to evade a Policial Chase over the Iguazú Falls (in the conjunction of the borderlines of Paraguay,Brazil and Argentina). Unlike other films directed by Armando Bo,here the romantic drama is accented rather than the sexual appeal of her female protagonist (Isabel only makes one nude scene,when swimming at a Forrest River).This dramatic accent will only be achieved balancing both elements,several years later,in \"Extasis Tropical\";also starred by Isabel Sarli.Another Argentine filmmaker that filmed in Paraguay in the middle of the 50s was Armando Bo, husband of actress Isabel Sarli, who made the movie “The Thunder between the Leaves” based on the story by Augusto Roa Bastos, with script by the author himself.  Various Paraguayan actors participated in the filming.In the 60s, several other movies were made starring Isabel Sarli, such as “La Burrerita de Ypacarai (“The Little Donkey Owner from Ypacarai”), “Carne” (“Meat”), “Poseída” (“Possessed”), all filmed partially or entirely in Paraguay.",
