The kids, Anna and her cousin Chip Chip, use the Flying Machine to fly across Europe to find Anna's father in London. Before it happens, they have to learn how to fly the magical machine... On their way they have to navigate an obstacle course of hot air-balloons, swoop into Paris on a mission of the flying machine, weather a fierce storm in the English Channel, and with sunset fast approaching find dad in the big darkening city of London. Before they reach him they are torn from the flying machine by a magic storm, and find themselves back in the pile of junk in Warsaw. However maybe the Dad saw something in the stormy skies of London, because the next day he comes home to his daughter.",
