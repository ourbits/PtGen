A film about the connections between walking and thinking, in which the ever-changing nature of things turns life into a place of mere passing. Between the cities of Montes Claros and Pedra Azul, in the northeast of Minas Gerais state, Brazil, three lonely drifters follow different paths, establishing very personal relationships with the elements of a transitory world. \"Drifter\" is the second film of Cao Guimaraes' solitude trilogy and emphasizes the connections between walking and thinking. Through the constant movement of ephemeral sounds and images, it brings up a contemplation of life as a place of mere passing.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0xd-FDs6KECao Guimaraes, filmmaker and visual artist, was born in 1965 in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, where he lives and works.
