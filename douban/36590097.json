    "introduction": "While Ekin (27) and Murat (28) return from a wedding at night, Ekin fails to see a bump in the road and his carelessness results in two flat tires. When they arrive at the repair shop with the help of a tow truck, Ekin and Murat see that the mechanics have set up a table with drinks and music. As they wait, Murat drinks raki but Ekin doesn’t. When Murat goes to the men’s room, the mechanic’s nephew realizes that Ekin is alone and hits on her. Murat witnesses this, but he can't reciprocate. Excusing herself, Ekin goes to the women's restroom which is in another garage. When she comes back from the restroom, she finds everyone sleeping. Walking towards the dawn in the industrial area, she disappears.源自：https://www.antalyaff.com/en/movies/nationalshortfilm/23/298",
