    "introduction": "Something evil has come to Portland Oregon. Bodies, horribly mutilated, are being discovered around town. It is near midnight when Eden Sullivan is drawn out of bed, lured by a siren call originating across town from a strange house, the same house from her reoccurring dream. A few nights later it happens again; some nights later yet again. Eden's sanity is soon pushed to the brink when she learns about an unsettling connection between her dreams and the murders. Patrick is a detective hired to assist the police in finding the serial killer. His investigation is plagued with false leads and dead ends in a seemingly impossible case. As both stories unfold, the mystery behind the murders unveils something very bizarre and sinister.",
