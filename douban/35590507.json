    "introduction": "Hollywood musicals on a massive scale are pleasing to our eyes and ears. But the more I watch them, the more I wonder why there aren't many musical films in Korea. This documentary goes to meet the directors who researched and made musical films in Korea, a wasteland of musical films, and also tells the story of a student who takes on the challenge of filming a musical from the perspective of young people, based on his research and interviews with those directors.",
