    "introduction": "\"Those Waiting For The Birds\" is the portrait of a game: \"pigeon racing\". Through passionate pigeon racers, such as Robert Calonne, an old mason and famous champion, Serge Taillieu, a young unemployed but diligent player, or Herbots Philip, who made breading pigeons a lucrative business, the film director is contemplating this sport today. As a kind of \"horse racing of the poor\", it has became a professional sport with a lot of money involved: thus dealing with doping, increased costs, international trades and speculations.",
