    "introduction": "One of the most influential and visionary artists of the past century is celebrated in this documentary which covers the highlights of his fascinating career. The format of the film mirrors the restless reality of his life; an inveterate traveller and always on the move, Max Ernst lived and worked in Germany, France, and America. His nomadic way of life kept him searching: \"A painter is lost if he finds himself.\" This film looks at his involvement with the Dadaists in Cologne, his time in Paris, his flight to New York, his life in America, and his return to Europe, revealing the \"private, brittle places of refuge\" he created at various stages in his life.",
