    "introduction": "Did Lino Brocka really die from a car accident? Or was he murdered by one of his enemies in the government? This is Brocka like you’ve never seen him before. Foaming at the mouth like the angriest dog in the world. He received the National Artist award—the highest honour given by the Philippines—in 1997, six years after his death at 52. But he considered himself an anarchist. His actual tirades serve as inter-titles. Images and sounds culled from his sixty-plus features. The ultimate homage and deconstruction. What if he was not a neorealist melodramatic director, but an avant-garde experimental filmmaker?源自：https://doclisboa.org/2023/en/filmes/national-anarchist-lino-brocka/",
