    "introduction": "The film revolves around Mahadev, one of the few educated young men in Sajjanpur,(A village near Satna ,Madhya Pradesh on Rewa Road ) who makes his living by writing letters for the largely illiterate population of the village. His ability to write persuasive letters makes him extremely popular in the village. The film is a delightful satirical take on a contemporary Indian village. The film was originally titled Mahadev ka Sajjanpur.The superstitous mother Ila Arun wants to get her manglik daughter \"\"Divya Dutta\"\" married; there is a young pretty and married woman waiting for her husband to return from the city, she also happens to be Mahadev’s childhood crush.",
