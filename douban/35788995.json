    "introduction": "A director returns to the town he was born to record the movie theaters that are disappearing. The town is no longer the same. He projects images on the walls of the houses, giving life to those dead spaces. Time absorbs both the history of the town and the director’s family. His father is no longer there and neither are films.",
