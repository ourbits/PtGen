Meanwhile, Eva fights with all her might to maintain a stable and harmonious life together. She gets support from her neighbor Pelle, who catches feelings for her. Felix seems to really like him, too. For a short time, a sense of family develops between the three. But Eva soon has to admit to herself that she can no longer cope with the situation at hand, and with the physical strength of her growing son.",
