    "introduction": "This documentary about street prostitutes is surprisingly revealing. A good selection of personalities and types, including males, are interviewed, and they seem to be pretty open about their lives and work, despite working illegally. From this collection of impressions the filmmaker cleverly shifts focus to the prettiest prostitute, even going on a call with her, and examining her strange relationship with her partner/pimp. Though like most in-field documentaries the filmography isn't great, both in terms from a equipment and technique, and the interviewer's skill leaves something to be desired, the documentary succeeds in drawing the audience into the time and place captured. It also seems that the maker was motivated by simple curiosity, rather than an agenda. Yet with all \"reality-based\" media you wonder what staging was involved, or if just the presence of the camera could have made people put on an act.",
