    "introduction": "Humanizing the deadliest drug epidemic in our history, CHRYSALIS brings us personal stories of self-discovery and transformation in those recovering across America. In Washington DC, artist Suzanne Firstenberg photographs those in recovery, only to discover the epidemic has reached her own household. In Denver, Rep. Brittany Pettersen is pulled from an Opioid committee meeting to find that her own mother has overdosed. In Salt Lake City, Destiny Garcia is arrested in a sting operation, only to become the face of recovery, working alongside the Mayor. With so many films showing the darkest aspects of this disease, our cameras land on those who are succeeding in transforming themselves.",
