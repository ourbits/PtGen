    "introduction": "One thousand years ago, an ancient race of shape-shifters -- known as the Gurrn -- fought to protect their home from warring human invaders. When they were defeated, their souls became trapped between the Earth and the Moon, bringing a curse upon the city of Steelhenge. To this day -- on the eve of each full moon -- a werewolf menace plagues Steelhenge, terrorizing its citizens and shaking the city to its core.In the present, a young man named Carson Stone is drawn to Steelhenge by a mysterious letter from the father who abandoned him as a child. Carson soon discovers his bloodline connection to the Gurrn and becomes embroiled in their fight. To protect the trapped and tortured souls from city leaders intent on harnessing their ancient powers for nefarious purposes, Carson teams up with three of his fellow werewolves -- and some even stranger allies -- only to discover that the humans may not be his only enemy.",
