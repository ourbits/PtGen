    "introduction": "Charlotte is a veteran beauty queen aspirant from a small village in the Philippines. She belongs to a family of beauty queens and her mother tries to employ all the trick she knows to make Charlotte win this year in their village's annual beauty pageant, \"Hiyas ng Dalampasigan\". However, a drop-dead gorgeous beauty, named Samantha, joins the contest from out of nowhere and thwarts Charlotte's chances. The two contestants engage in an ultimate battle, inside and outside the pageant premises but is stopped by a mysterious half-naked hunk named Kojic Acid, who saves them from a band of assassins. He tells them that they share a common heritage and that they both need to work together to save not just themselves but the entire tribe of Chin Chan Soo, their forgotten home-tribe. The two beauty hopefuls struggle to train and work together to face and fight their common enemy, a mad ruler named Pei-pak-wah. They soon learn that they share not just a common enemy but a common destiny as well. Written by charlotte",
