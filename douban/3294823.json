    "introduction": "英国独立电影的经典作品，不知道为何很少被人提到，导演似乎也不太出名，最近出的DVD。喜欢MIKE LEIGH电影的人应该会同样喜欢这部吧。Sam Shepard plays Irish prison escapee Jo Bronco Bullfrog. Hiding out in a seamy section of London's East End, Bullfrog befriends a gang of teenagers. Looking for kicks, the kids team up with Bullfrog, but his notion of excitement proves too much for them. Some good scenes, backed by excellent location photography, do not mitigate some of the more foolish aspects of the storyline. Completed in 1970, Bronco Bullfrog was withheld from general release for nearly two years.Set in the East End of London at the tail end of the 60s; BRONCO BULLFROG is the story of a young couple who decide to run away when their parents disapprove of their growing love for each other. They decide to hole up with Joe 'Bronco Bullfrog' who is in hiding after going on the run from Borstal. All three realise though that the law will catch up with them soon.Bronco Bullfrog is the first film Mike Leigh should have made. It is set in the East End and was filmed in six weeks in and around Stratford. Using young actors from Joan Littlewood's acting workshop, much of the film is improvised from the script thus giving the film an authenticity lacking in most other home grown efforts (see \"Quadrophenia\").",
