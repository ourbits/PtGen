    "introduction": "A story about a love couple, living in small apartment which they are leasing from another couple. Nebojsa is a journalist who works too much, and he wants Jelena to do everything what all Montenegrin women traditionally do. Jelena is on studying literature, and suspicious that Nebojsa is having an affair. Of course, the owners of the apartment are coming in their lives and bringing their problems to Nebojsa and Jelena - Nata, Dragica's and Dragoljub's daughter is a problematic kid.But maybe the most interesting thing about this movie is that, person who is re-telling this story is a man with amnesia who doesn't know in which bathroom he fell on his head, and is writing this whole story a part of his therapy.The acting is great, especially from the debuting actress Ivona Covic (Nata) who did a brilliant job. Many of these actors and actresses appear in a movie for the first time (Andrija Milosevic, Dubravka Vukotic, Ivona Covic) but the most interesting thing is that this is also the first movie for Marija Perovic (Director) and she also did great job. You should see it!",
