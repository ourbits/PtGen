    "introduction": "A new, compelling documentary about the illegal hunt of whales in Iceland. The documentary tells us why Iceland reopened to whaling after a long stop, the costs of this trade, the danger of an extinction and for our ecosystem, the illegality in which many people act, and a wall of silence which surrounds this activity. A very strong contrast for a nation that focuses on ecological and nature tourism, where one of the sectors that generates the most income is whale watching.",
