    "introduction": "After an abortion, a woman wanders the streets, embarking on a series of quiet encounters under a neon glow. Taking place over the course of a single night and drawing on the writings of cult literary figures Kathy Acker, Bernadette Mayer and Alice Notley, Beatrice Gibson’s debut feature collapses dream and reality, liquefying both. Shot in the dim reddish light of Chinatown, in the neon hues of karaoke joints, cinemas and clubs and featuring a cast of artists, poets and non-professional actors at its core, Night is a feminist epic that turns the genre on its head. A collective auto- fiction.",
