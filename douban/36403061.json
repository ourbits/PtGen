    "introduction": "Grieving the suicide of a close friend, a filmmaker travels out to Las Vegas at the peak of a suicide epidemic in an attempt to study the issue and find answers. There, she comes across the story of Levi Presley, a happy and accomplished young man, who suddenly jumped off the city’s tallest casino. Experts have studied the causes of suicide in the city for years. That same week of Levi’s death, the United States Senate voted to permanently store the nation’s nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain - located just outside the city. The mountain is the most studied piece of geology on earth. Weaving together the studies of two great unknowns, this free-wielding documentary explores how people arrive at answers. Through interviews with the boy’s survivors, suicide experts, Yucca Mountain geologists, politicians, statisticians, and a psychic medium who talks to Levi’s spirit this film actively struggles with the nature of facts, subjective realities and fleeting truths.",
