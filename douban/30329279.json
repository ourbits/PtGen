    "introduction": "Check-in and checkout this vibrant new comedy about life in a hotel. The Host is an innovative, star-studded new scripted series that mixes comedy, impersonations and music - with all the usual - and not so usual - goings-on that you'd expect in a contemporary hotel. Adrian is the hotel's host - or general manager. His wife broke his heart by leaving him for her ex on their honeymoon and now, a few months later, he's moved into the hotel to live and returned to his job, hoping that it will distract him from his misery. However, that's easier said than done, as his wife keeps popping up, in all manner of situations...but most of the times only he can see her. Will he ever get her out of his mind? Maybe his sexy new assistant, Andy, will help...? Keeping Adrian on his toes are Nico, the hotel's PR manager - desperate to try his hand on stage as a comedian - and Martin, who looks after the nightly cabaret sessions. Colourful, energetic, wacky and great fun, The Host is unlike anything ...",
