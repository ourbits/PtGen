For its mid-length debut, he chose a bizarre story taking place in the collecting of waste paper. The hero is there peculiar výkupčí who becomes witness to all sorts of embarrassing and moving events. The director here has proven a sense of spontaneity, bizarre and morbid preoccupation, has suggested the name itself.",
