    "introduction": "Filmmaker shows a Mormon cult attacked from inside and outside Don Argott's documentaries, such as The Art of the Steal (NYFF 2009) and Framing John DeLorean (2019), openly reject objectivity and show a penchant for siding with someone he thinks has been wronged. Something akin to this pattern pops up again in his new film about a branch of the extreme Mormon FLDS Church (The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints) with the addition that he injects himself as an observer whose coolness turns to sympathy over a period of years.",
