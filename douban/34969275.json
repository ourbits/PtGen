    "introduction": "Three stories, about three women who live in the same building, interwoven together to create a kaleidoscopic observation of the experience of being a mother, and the self-sacrifice that one gives to the world, by bringing life into it at the same time. The stories take place during the nihilistic period, on the edge of a civil war that almost started in Macedonia in 2001, and express the psychosis, and the pressure that common people lived through during those days. With the character study of these three women Sandra, Angelina, and Eleonora, and the men around them, we try to penetrate in, and reflect, the psycho-pathology of the decaying, and agonizing socio-economic system in transition from Communism into Democracy. Each one of these women struggles to find meaning in their existence, in the absurd and meaningless times, and surrounding. And each one of them faces her own personal demons, and struggles to preserve her humanity.",
