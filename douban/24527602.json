    "introduction": "A raw account of how some of the best architects in the world, design giants like Jean Nouvel, Frank Gehry or Zaha Hadid, struggle to beat the competition for the National Museum of Art in Andorra. While nearly as old as the profession itself, architectural competitions became a social, political and cultural phenomenon of the post-Guggenheim Bilbao building bubble. Taking place at the dramatic moment in which the real estate bubble became a global crisis, this is the first competition to be documented, producing an unclassifiable piece of art that may be an intense thriller, an ethnographic report as well as a cult movie around the icons of the contemporary architecture",
