    "introduction": "At night, in his studio perched high above the lights of New York, Bill Diamond, a famous photographer, invents stories and fairy tales, to chase away the evil spirits his memories keep bringing back. One of these stories is about Mark, a gifted photographer who lives alone, embittered and withdrawn from the world, in a church that once was his studio on the lake of Geneva. Mark has lost everything: his fame, his wife, his friends, and above all, his self-esteem. His dear friend Luc, the village policeman, is the only companion he has left. Into this bleak world, Bill sends Jessi, a beautiful model he once worked with. Jessi tells Mark that Bill is dead, and that he is now to continue the work the elder photographer had begun. Mark reacts to this offer with cynicism, but because he needs money, he accepts. The relationship between Mark and Jessi is difficult and tense. Yet in the course of their work Mark becomes more and more fascinated by this strange, gentle woman. Could Jessi really be the angel Bill Diamond says she is?",
