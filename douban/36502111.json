    "introduction": "After the Nazi gold and the bank secret, the practices of commodities trading and extracting companies based in Switzerland will be the reason for the next defamation of the country. Large parts of the world trade in commodities are handled by companies based in Zug and Geneva. They are known to pay very little taxes and to defy responsibility for environmental damages caused in the extracting countries. TRADING PARADISE shows how this business works and how NGOs try to improve the transparency and liability of these commodities giants",
