    "introduction": "Good music takes time. The Band \"The Notwist\" works in the quiet surroundings of the small Bavarian town Weilheim with a reliable and productive group of producers and musicians. Documentary filmmaker Joerg Adolph spent 70 days with \"maybe the most important Pop-Group in Germany\" (FAZ), while they where recording their masterpiece \"Neon Golden\". The film shows the intimate situation of working in the studio, where the music is composed, recorded, listened to, redone, discussed, abandoned and redone again. The DVD features also the video for PILOT, also directed by Joerg Adolph.",
