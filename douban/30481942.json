    "introduction": "In a worn out city still hot and sticky after the last weekend of summer, the destinies of Anna, Bruno, Irene, Dennis, Marika, Nico and Ferruccio briefly cross paths and then disperse, leaving behind the bitter taste of nostalgia. They are the millennials, born after ‘84 and in the peak of young adulthood, yet they are right in the midst of economic crisis. They have grown up without certainties about work or even love. They live in Cagliari, where leaving is often an obligation and not a choice. Leaving an island like Sardinia is harder than leaving just anywhere. The inevitability of leaving makes the journey a drain and not an adventure.",
