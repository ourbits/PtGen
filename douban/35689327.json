    "introduction": "In Italy, old, dirty, congested prisons full of violence and abuse are a dim and distant memory. Now prisoners serve their sentences in a state of deep sleep which renders them inoffensive and has drastically reduced reoffending rates. Hypersleep is an efficient, economically viable and reliable system. That is, until the day when David Damiani (Stefano Accorsi), a psychologist charged with monitoring prisoners’ mental states, finds himself faced with a prisoner about whom all information has been lost. It’s an unexpected event which triggers a chain of unforeseeable event, forcing David to face up to the ghosts of his very own past.",
