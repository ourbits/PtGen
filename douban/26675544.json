When San-do grows closer to Han-chu as he draws his nude portrait, Yo-han kills him and disguises his death as a drowning. In the end, Yo-han receives Han-chu's love and they go for their honeymoon to the mountain villa where San-do died. But before they get to the sweetness of their honeymoon, a series of foreboding events happen one after another. San-do, who should be in his grave, shows up. As a chase ensues, the mountain villa is enveloped in tension and misery.",
