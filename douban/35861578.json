    "introduction": "UBUNTU shines a light on the Mamas of Cape Town, a group of tenacious, heroic women, who have never been acknowledged.Intense deprivation, severe poverty, and ubiquitous suffering – these were the harsh realities of day-to-day life for Black women living under the oppression of Apartheid South Africa. With institutionalized racism enshrined as the law of the land, Black women were left without any access to power, opportunity, or protection. Despite these hardships, the Mamas' tenacity allowed them to survive and even triumph over the cruel hand they were dealt. Together against the odds and all through Apartheid, they transformed their communities and became the backbone upon which South Africa was built.Their inspiring and timeless stories of resilience and love strike at the heart and spirit of our own humanity.  Time and again, history has overlooked these women; it is now time to give them a voice.",
