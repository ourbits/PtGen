    "introduction": "The screenplay tells the story of Irene, who, at the tender age of 8, is the sole witness to her father’s death at the hands of a hit and run driver. Haunted by a sense of guilt for not remembering the assassin’s face, Irene becomes a rebellious, introverted teen whose sole obsession is justice for her father. She drops out of school and finds work in a factory owned by the icy yet fascinating Michele, who was none other than the man behind the wheel at the time. The young woman doesn’t seem to recognise him, but there’s no doubt in his mind over her identity. Michele feels instinctively protective of the girl, a feeling which soon transforms into love. Totally oblivious, Irene begins to open up and confide in the very man she’s hunting down. But as the net closes in around Michele, something unexpected happens…",
