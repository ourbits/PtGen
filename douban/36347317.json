    "introduction": "The kanji character “莉(Rei)“by itself has little meaning. It gains significance only when combined with others.Hikari Matsushita is a company employee in her early thirties who lives in Tokyo. She doesn't have any particular worries, or so she thinks. To put it differently, that is her concern. Hikari does not find her own sense of worth.The people around her, in contrast to her, each carries significant issues. Everyone has their own counterparts, and they are awkwardly balanced by being connected to each other.Then, by chance, Hikari meets a man who is a deaf landscape photographer living deep in the mountains of Hokkaido, far from Tokyo. Through this connection, she begins to discover the value of her own existence, but this gradually leads the relationships with those around her to crumble.The beauty and harshness of nature, the imperfections and fragility of humans are portrayed in a subdued manner, set in contrast to each other.源自：https://filmfreeway.com/APairofREI",
