    "introduction": "A middle-class couple from La Mancha at the gates of old age, they lead an ordinary life. They spend the summer with their 36-year-old son, who is totally dependent, in the same coastal apartment for more than 30 years. The same beaches, the same friends, the same places, the same rituals... But this year there is something different. A small stain, which has always been dormant, begins to spread across your reality. The decadence painting to the last corner of their lives. A succession of moments that show the futility and absurdity of his existence.",
