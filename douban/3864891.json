    "introduction": "Sure, it's a simple trifle in film history, if even that, and seeing Sangue di sbirro today is at best mildly entertaining. For although made in the heyday of the Italian crime genre this one is no zenith. Dan Caputo (George Eastman of dubious Antropophagus-fame) arrives in New York to avenge the death of his father, a cop involved with the mafia. Dan clears up the murder (and kills what seem like some 30 people) with help of local mob boss Duke (Jack Palance) and then flies back to wherever he came from. Possibly there is a bit more to the story, but the script is so confused so there is little point in trying to describe the goings-on. Suffice to say there is a little romance, brief scenes childhood reminiscing, and a helluva lot of shoot outs. Some of which are quite exiting in a cheapo euro trash way. The highlight of the film is definitely the opening scene at the airport when Dan arrives during some sort of terrorist attack simply to shoot his way through it. All in all it's not a badly done revenge film technically, and it's clichéd in the best sense of the word, but it suffers from some seriously dragging scenes, and a poorly executed whodunit sub plot, which slows the whole thing down. Only recommended for the die-hard fan of Italian 70's crime films.",
