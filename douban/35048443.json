    "introduction": "A new film from acclaimed filmmaker, Briar March.The Greenham Common protests began in 1981 when a group of Welsh women, known as the Women For Life On Earth, marched from Cardiff to Greenham Common in Berkshire to protest the 96 US Cruise nuclear missiles being placed at the RAF base there.Realising that the march alone would not be enough to get the missiles removed, the women camped outside the base to continue their protest – one that would last nearly 20 years. The Greenham Women realised that without a similar peace effort in the East, their protest in the West would be ineffectual so travelled to Russia to meet with like-minded activists.When the Cold War ended and the Berlin Wall fell, Russian president Mikhail Gorbachev referenced the importance of the Greenham Women’s contribution.The film is feature interviews with key participants alongside archive footage from the Greenham Common Women’s Peace Camp.",
