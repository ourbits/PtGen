    "introduction": "Together with his dogs, 71-year-old Montenegro lives in a big tent on a quiet island in a river delta. He makes fishing nets, which earns him the money to get tobacco and alcohol - the only luxuries he allows himself. On the other side of the island lives César, who keeps bees and herds pigs in the service of a farmer from the civilized world. César has a boat they use to go fishing. In return, Montenegro cooks for César. Based on mutual dependence, their friendship looks to be a lasting one. But as time goes by, something like envy starts to brew, and a conflict starts between the two men. Eventually it will place their friendship in a new light. Jorge Gaggero patiently follows his two protagonists as they go about their daily activities: mending the nets, feeding the pigs, chopping wood, frying fish, and smoking a pipe. Appearing throughout the film, the ever-alert dogs transcend their role as extras by announcing plot twists. Close-ups of the men's weather-beaten faces and tanned skin add to the scenes of outdoor life.",
