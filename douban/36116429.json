    "introduction": "\"Why can't everything just stay the way it is?\" asks Krause at the beginning of the story. At Sunday lunch, he realized with indignation that Paula had changed the inn's menu and now offers vegetarian dishes. He reacts furiously to Mayor Stübner's idea to transform Schönhorst into a holiday village. Everyone in town is talking about the future, has everyone conspired against him? State Secretary Hummel has her eye on Krauses pastures. The dry field, which hardly gives the horses any food, would be an ideal location for wind turbines. Meta wants to accept the purchase offer, but Krause is strictly against it. He stands alone in an argument with his sister: Elsa has no opinion on this. When Krause meets the singer Fanny again, he gets to know her elderly father. What kind of perspective does the centenarian have when the coal mine devours his house? Krause slowly begins to understand that he has to do something for the future. What has to change so that everything can stay the way it is?",
