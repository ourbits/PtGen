    "introduction": "In-Depth Series Explores The Iran Hostage Crisis Of 1979 And The Tumultuous History of U.S./Iran Relations.On November 4, 1979, Iranian student activists stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran, taking over 60 Americans hostage. What was planned as a 48-hour sit-in to protest American imperialism, ballooned into an international crisis and 24/7 media event that would last 444 days. With never-before-seen archival footage and revelatory new interviews with the American hostages and Iranian hostage-takers alike, the series is a gripping chronicle of one of the most dramatic international deadlocks in American history, a deep dive into the geo-political history that led to the crisis, and an exploration of the political fallout that reverberates today. - HBOPart One: “The Peacock Throne”Part Two: “Den of Spies”Directed by Maro Chermayeff, Abbas Motlagh, and Sam PollardPart Three: “The Sand Storm”Directed by Joshua Bennett & Abbas MotlaghPart Four: “The Transaction”Directed by Jeff Dupre & Abbas MotlaghHBO Documentary Films presents a Show of Force Production HOSTAGES.
