    "introduction": "A riveting examination of masculinity, sexism, and homophobia in hip-hop culture. Delivering a self-described \"loving critique\" of rap music, director Byron Hurt -- a former star college quarterback, longtime hip-hop fan, and now gender violence prevention educator -- pays tribute to the power and creativity of hip-hop while challenging the rap music industry to take responsibility for glamorizing destructive, deeply conservative stereotypes of manhood. This documentary features revealing insights from rappers such as Mos Def, Fat Joe, Chuck D, Jadakiss, and Busta Rhymes, hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons, and cultural commentators such as Michael Eric Dyson, Beverly Guy-Sheftall, and Kevin Powell. Critically acclaimed for its fearless engagement with issues of race and racism, gender violence, and the corporate exploitation of youth culture. 60 min.
