Now, learn how they do it. Join National Geographic for an inside view of top-secret contemporary CIA missions—including the manhunt for Osama bin Laden after 9/11 and field operations in Pakistan that enabled the CIA to prevent a wave of explosions planned by al Qaeda. Veteran intelligence officers discuss the events—from surveillance and raids, to arrests and evidence collection, to a joint U.S./Pakistani strike force at the doorsteps of terror cells—that halted some of the most significant terror plots since 9/11.",
