On the way they will meet some extraordinary men and women, they will explore the great moments such as The Battle of Britain and The Berlin Airlift, and will uncover little known stories of bravery and brilliance.It is a story of amazing machines and epic battles but above all it is the story of the men and women whose courage and ingenuity have been at the heart of the RAF for 100 years.",
