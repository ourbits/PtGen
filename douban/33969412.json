    "introduction": "A public pool, a sociotope. Blue Summer Symphony is set in a place of daydreaming and gentle snoozing where we observe a web of secular interactions in a hot summer afternoon. With its character-driven approach, the film orchestrates an overwhelming bitter sweetness of five groups of people from different generations, from children to adolescents and from millennials to the middle-aged. Each one of them has his or her problems and worries, yet, each slice of life weaves into one complex whole. With its striking black-and-white cinematography, the film finds its way to the poetic beauty of everyday life.",
