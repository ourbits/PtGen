    "introduction": "You might believe cats are indifferent, with a ‘couldn’t care less’ attitude, but this film reveals cats as more complex, interesting and even cuter than you can imagine. As we witness the astonishing transformation a new-born kitten makes when growing into a fully-grown cat, we discover the amazing, secret life of cats..With the balance of a ballerina, senses so acute they can see what’s invisible to us, and unique social skills they’re deservedly the most popular pets in Britain. No matter whether your cat’s the latest pedigree breed or common-or-garden household moggy, brand new filming techniques uncover the awe-inspiring qualities each and every one of them possesses.This beautifully shot film is also jam packed with heart-warming stories of cats who  take care of their owners, who save lives and who have survived against the odds.",
