    "introduction": "The story behind the Beatles is well known to some, but not many people know the story of Dezider “Dezzo” Hoffmann. As fate had it, their lives crossed paths at the best possible time. The Beatles were at the brink of global stardom while Dezzo was fifty years old – an age when many people consider retiring from the biz. But the Beatles’ energy, spirit, and joy of life wholly inspired him. He felt younger next to them and was suddenly bursting with new ideas. So he decided to devote his time to what he knew best – photography. He took more photos of the Beatles than anyone else in history and recorded all the major events of their dazzling career. But the Beatles weren't the only ones he captured on camera. His photos of other famous celebrities have also become iconic and full of life, spontaneity, and movement.",
