    "introduction": "A story of the Chukchi, a people whose livelihood is provided by the sea. They are native to the Chukchi Peninsula, the shores of the Chukchi Sea and the Bering Sea region of the Arctic Ocean. Russians contacted them for the first time in the 17th century. The film follows almost four hundred years of these people’s history, marked by the process of colonisation, and combines documentary form, archival footage and animation to illustrate the Chukchi’s ancient legends. Once again the filmmakers put forward their perennial question: how to preserve a culture and a language on the brink of extinction?源自：https://doclisboa.org/2023/en/filmes/fata-morgana/",
