Separate for the first time in their lives, the film charts new relationships with boys, girls and eccentric old ladies (Adam Driver, Isabelle McNally, and Lynn Cohen). Beautiful music sequences capture fleeting emotions as their lives move in unexpected directions. \"Not Waving But Drowning\" is paired with \"The Most Girl Part of You\" a dark, but sweet short film.",
