    "introduction": "Written by Fazekas, the script of this black comedy centres on the conflict between an ambitious judicial officer (Orosz) and an old woman in debt (Nagy) who is protecting her home. The story takes place in only one location, in front of the woman’s house, over one day, from the morning to the late afternoon. Due to the old lady’s strong resistance, more and more authorities have to get involved, creating an absurd chaos that is at the heart of the film and frames the narrative arc of the main character. Throughout that day, we will discover a judicial officer who seems efficient and professional, but who in reality is nothing but a young boy trying to show the world how tough he can be. However, by witnessing the drama of the old lady and her eviction, he will realise that he can no longer be an obedient little soldier for the system.",
