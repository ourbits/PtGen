    "introduction": "Dave is a wannabe drug dealer stuck with a batch of experimental new pills, Ray is a failing club DJ getting by on a daytime radio slot, and socially awkward office worker Bernard just turned up to the wrong party by mistake. When Dave enlists Bernard's help to test out his new consignment, the weekend descends into a riotous cocktail of narcotics, booze, clubs and parties. Embarking on a series of drug-fueled misadventures, the three lads get more from the weekend then they'd ever bargained for. Bernard discovers a Dublin he never knew existed, Ray struggles to deal with his personal relationships and Dave tries to break the world record for selling drugs in order to clear his debts with one truly psychotic gangster.",
