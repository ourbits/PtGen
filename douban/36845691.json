    "introduction": "With the aim of finding a new direction in his life, a young filmmaker decides to join the last expedition of Professor Alejandro Gándara before he retires. They decide to follow in the footsteps of Ulysses on his journey home, to try to recover what they have lost along the way. From Troy to Ithaca, the journey will not be an attempt to literally follow the route narrated in the Odyssey, but a journey through feelings. An adventure that will push perception to sink into the landscape to go beyond the realm of the known and navigate the waters that separate the past from the present, memory from oblivion, reality from fantasy.A film that pursues a dialogue with those who preceded us, dead or alive, to ask them about what is genuinely human. And to check if after so much time and over so much change, there is something that remains.",
