    "introduction": "Tight,well done turns out to be a true story., 26 February 2008Author: irwin-24 from United StatesI was lucky to have attended the Premier because the picture didn't hang around too long. Hail was written and released months before Nixon's downfall. The writers must of had an inside line to the White House. Scene by scene, Hail to the Chief is a complete story of the nuts we elect to save our country. I loved the men's room scene. Dan Resin makes a good president. Get a copy, if you can and compare to George. It was rather unfortunate that picture was not picked up for general distribution. There was probably too much realism in the picture as compared to the actual picture on Capital Hill. The uniforms for the White House Guards, the paranoia that surrounded Nixon and his military hit unit that was all around him, was presented in a very laughable manner. Still and all, Hail to the Chief continues to be a good picture to enjoy. The simple fact that this Commander-in-Chief satire, still rings true in our current events makes the picture almost timeless. Hopefully, only the comedy aspect will be timeless.",
