Their personalities clash, but then one of them introduces the other to her unconventional policy of having sex when a patient dies. “It’s about love, death and sex, and the ways we find meaning despite knowing that soon, we’ll all be gone,” she says, mentioning “incredible paramedics” who shared their stories. “They are among the world’s best in confronting fear with humor and laughing when faced with a loss. This is the world we wanted to explore.”",
