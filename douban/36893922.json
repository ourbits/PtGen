An ex heroin addict and now drug counsellor living in the eclectic vibes of Bristol – he decides to start a balkan band with his friends from rehab and bring his roots and love for music to the city. A renegade by nature – he rebels against any systemic form and although the band is excelling, his responsibilities are rapidly falling apart – including the relationship with his daughter, Maria. Having always struggled with his past and self-forgiveness he must find reasons to stay afloat and the strength to fight against a potential relapse.",
