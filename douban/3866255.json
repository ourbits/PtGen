    "introduction": "Three old friends get together for a get-rich-quick scheme that stubbornly refuses to go as planned in this comedy from Chilean filmmaker Ricardo Carrasco Farfan. El Negro (Sergio Hernandez) grew up in a small village in Chile, only to move away in hopes of finding success in Santiago; after the death of his mother, he returns home for the first time in years to attend the funeral, though his loss doesn't appear to have had much of an impact on him. After the funeral, El Negro runs into a pair of old friends -- Guaton Molina (Emilio Garcia) and Chico Mario (Luis Dubo) -- who offer to bring him in on a slightly shady business deal they've been planning. Molina and Mario plan to head out to the seaside, buy a large supply of fresh seafood, and sell it in town during Holy Week at a substantial profit. El Negro agrees to help, kicking in both some needed cash and the use of his truck, but as soon as they put their plan into motion, the three pals find themselves followed by a strange combination of both good and bad luck.",
