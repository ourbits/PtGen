    "introduction": "The Gardener of Eden is a short avant-garde movie by James Broughton (who has filmed it on Sri Lanka in 1981) with one main actor (Bevis Bawa) and many shots on flowers and on a few faces of young or mature men. This short has no clear plot but it has great atmosphere of long mythological concept awaken by the figure of \"Gardener of Eden\" who takes care about the flowers and plants in the garden of the life. The movie is based on a combination of shoots on old man's face or body and on the various flowers, trees, leaves and blows and on some male faces. There is also wonderful music by Antarjyami Muni in this movie. It's a kind of minimalistic music, a strange buzz of different frequencies.",
