    "introduction": "The most recent work from renowned director, author and producer André Hörmann patiently and sensitively traces the paths of US-American boxing talents Kenny Jr. and Destyne Jr. Raised on Chicago’s notorious South Side, the two friends and rivals begin promising careers at roughly the same time. Soon, however, their paths part. While Kenny starts to gain a foothold in the world of professional boxing, Destyne has to serve time in prison. The result is a moving story about repression, ambition, discipline and the irrepressible hope of overcoming the odds.",
