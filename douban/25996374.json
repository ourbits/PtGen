    "introduction": "患有阿斯佩尔格氏综合症（一种自闭症）的达伦，一直过着与世隔绝的生活，知道有一天他遇到了一位专门照料受伤鸟类的女孩，而她正需要他的帮助。Darren Meadows is 27. He has his routine, he has his immaculate apartment, and he has his mind. He also has Aspergers. Throughout his life he has found very few people who have understood him, so he has sequestered himself from the world. When he reached out in the past he was hurt so badly that he shut down, stopped even trying to connect with them. He finds comfort in facts-facts don't change, technology-computers are built with logic boards, and consistency-like the rhythm of the crashing waves on the beach. It is there at the beach (after a minor computer meltdown causing a major frustrating blow-up) that he suddenly finds himself forced to connect with someone: a female someone, who has found an injured bird. Darren feels compelled to help her and as a result starts feeling emotions he thought he had buried, destroyed, obliterated from his consciousness. Darren Meadows is falling in love.",
