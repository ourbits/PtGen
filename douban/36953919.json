As an older sister, Maya always tried to keep Adi safe and out of trouble. Maya's efforts were successful at first. Adi and Maya's lives were peaceful. However, the peace of life suddenly changed drastically when Adi suddenly disappeared without a trace. Maya immediately did everything she could to find her younger brother. On the other hand, a journalist named Risang was investigating a corruption case involving Regent Zaenal in the city of Rimbalaya. This investigation led him to Zaenal's rehabilitation center, where Adi was found in suspicious conditions. Risang began to feel that there was something bigger and darker behind the rehabilitation facility. This rehabilitation facility became the beginning of a series of strange events involving undead zombies. Ella, a girl from Jakarta, was accidentally caught up in a tragic event while visiting Rimbalaya to meet her grandmother. Fate brought Ella together with Maya, Risang, and Adi amidst various horrific incidents that continued to occur in the city. Slowly, they were dragged into a dirty political conflict involving power and dark secrets in Rimbalaya. With the situation getting more critical, the threat of the living dead that is increasingly numerous and brutal continues to lurk them. They must also race against time to save themselves and their loved ones. They try to escape from the city before Rimbalaya completely turns into a red zone that cannot be left.",
