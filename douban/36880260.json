    "introduction": "Coca-Cola is extremely important to the people of Chiapas - it is used ritually during prayers in church, it determines a person's status, and if a local politician wants to win the people's vote, he or she has to serve 180 cases of Coke at a rally. What's more, local healers (curanderos) believe in the healing power of Coca-Cola. There is an epidemic of diabetes and obesity in Chiapas, while at the same time the Coca-Cola plants are depleting the groundwater, leaving residents without access to drinking water. The indigenous community is aware of the problem, but has no means of stopping 'coca colonisation'.",
