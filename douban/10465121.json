    "introduction": "That's So Raven is an American teen sitcom television series. It debuted on the Disney Channel on January 17, 2003, and ended its run on November 10, 2007. The show spawned Disney Channel's first spin-off series: Cory in the House. The series was nominated in 2005 and 2007 for Emmy Awards for outstanding children's programming.[1]The show is a modern-day sitcom with a teenage twist in the vein of Bewitched.[citation needed] Producers added supernatural abilities that Raven, the main character, has that would get her into curious situations. The show is set (but was not produced) in San Francisco and revolves around teenager Raven Baxter, played by Raven-Symoné, her friends Eddie (Orlando Brown) and Chelsea (Anneliese van der Pol), and her family members focusing on brother Cory (Kyle Massey). The title character draws on her talent, ingenuity, psychic powers and a variety of disguises to get into and out of amusing adolescent and pre-adolescent situations.Reruns of episodes aired on the ABC Kids Saturday morning segment of Disney-owned ABC broadcast network in the United States until August 27, 2011, when the block was discontinued. Reruns currently air in Canada on Family and VRAK.TV, with some episodes also available on DVD. No announcement has been made as to whether the show will get complete season releases on DVD or Blu-ray. That's So Raven is still popular in syndication, garnering higher ratings than any other Disney Channel show.",
