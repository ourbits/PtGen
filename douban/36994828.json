    "introduction": "The Mozart Bird (1993) is South African-born auteur Aryan Kaganof's second feature, following his hit debut Kyodai Makes the Big Time (1992).  Made when Kaganof still went by his birth name Ian Kerkhof, the film has been described as a 'Last Tango in Amsterdam' and was trashed by some critics, including the director's friend Jeremy Dowson, as being supposedly 'misogynistic.'Notably, The Mozart Bird features the subtitle \"A Film About Cunt Cuntness Cuntility Cuntissue\" and of course features intimate sex scenes, though the film is largely comprised of philosophical arguments between the two protagonists on everything from sex to Nietzsche.",
