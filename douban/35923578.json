    "introduction": "After Maxi wins an important music award, the pressure for her to release an album only increases. But pressure equals crisis, crisis equals self-doubt, and self-doubt does not make for a creative atmosphere. Maxi’s inner child can lash out as much as it likes, but her inner cop won’t give it even a minute to play or relax. A playful, glitter-covered study of depression and burnout.",
