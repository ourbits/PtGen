    "introduction": "It is impossible to talk about the history of Korean independent documentaries that blossomed after the 1980s through actively raising voice against the oppressive social atmosphere without mentioning Seoul Visual Collective. As one pillar of the “troika” of the independent documentary groups, along with DocuPurn and Labor News Production (LNP), Seoul Visual Collective have presented unique works. Since the start of the millennium, Korean independent documentaries tend to focus more on personal documentaries that emphasize politics in our daily lives rather than promoting social engagement. At a time when the role of documentary films as social engagement is being considered important once again, looking back on the two decades of Seoul Visual Collective will take on a special meaning.",
