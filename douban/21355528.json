    "introduction": "\"Life Inside Out\" tells the parallel stories of Laura, a devoted mother of three teenage sons, and her struggling son Shane, the family misfit and a mystery to his Dad and brothers. When Laura stumbles upon her long forgotten guitar, she rediscovers her passion for music and songwriting. In an impulsive move to avoid attending another of her sister Lydia's scrapbook parties, Laura goes to her first open mic night, taking Shane (anxious to escape his own unpleasant fate on a father-son fishing trip) along for the ride. Despite her rocky entry into a new world of clubs and unusual characters, this first step into expressing herself proves to be the catalyst for changing not only her life, but Shane's, in complex and unpredictable ways.",
