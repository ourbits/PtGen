    "introduction": "Directed by reliable journeyman Umberto Lenzi and starring Roger Browne (who began his career in peplum films, but always seemed better-suited to and more comfortable in spy-espionage films), LAST MAN TO KILL has everything the fan of Euro-spy films could want. A witty, sly hero (Browne is excellent here); interesting mid-east location shooting; a plot that is both simple and convoluted at the same time; cheesy lounge-spy music (with an organ that sounds like it was borrowed from Joe Meek's studio!); low-budget props and sets; chases and fights; and even the occasional zoom photography. The dubbed sound effects are outrageous, and in some of the action scenes sound like they could have come from a 1970's Hong Kong martial arts film. This only adds to the fun and excitement of the film! Not much to analyze here--if you are a fan of dubbed Euro-spy action, you'll want to see this one. And Lenzi's fans won't be let down either. My copy is from a pan-and-scan, English-dubbed copy taped off UHF television in the 1980s--unfortunately, the days when we could rely on this kind of entertainment being available regularly and for free are long gone. Roger Browne is also put to good use in the films RIFIFI IN AMSTERDAM and PASSWORD:KILL AGENT GORDON, crime-spy films from the same era. Of course, director Umberto Lenzi made dozens of excellent films in any number of genres--as late as the 90s he was still churning out wonderful low-budget action films such as MEAN TRICKS (see my review) starring Charles Napier.",
