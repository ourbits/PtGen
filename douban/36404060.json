    "introduction": "Angels in the House of Sun remains one of Rakhshān Banietemad’s mostarticulate critiques of the treatment of women in contemporary Iranian society.Male-on-female violence is an all-too-common occurrence inIran. It’s part of a wider exploration of gender imbalance that permeates so much of Banietemad’s work. Here, the filmmaker journeys into the backstreets of one of the poorer districts of Tehran, to a shelter where women can find safety, community and a sense of belonging with others who understand their situation – whose lives have been marked by suffering and humiliation.源自：https://www.sheffdocfest.com/film/angels-house-sun",
