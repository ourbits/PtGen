    "introduction": "In an Escher-like staircase, two characters, a man a woman, move around each other, in full view of the bizarre objects in the space: an infinite clock, a miniature surveillance camera, the hose of a vacuum cleaner. The camera always chooses a subjective point of view, namely from the vantage point of one of the objects or characters, who lose themselves in a game of attraction or repulsion. A surreal universe.",
