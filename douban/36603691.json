After graduating from film school, he became a commercially successful filmmaker in Russia. However, the author's international fame came with the Georgian film “Hostages” (2017), where he undertook a serious drama.Nurse Sasha works at a government clinic in the Soviet Empire. She is assigned to take care of the desperately sick party leader. The patient has long lost touch with reality. Not only because of his illness but above all because he has been at the top of the country for such a long time. The old man believes he controls the state. In fact, he has long been a puppet in a system that functions out of inertia.",
