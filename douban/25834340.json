The faithful few have gathered on the morning before the election to watch England in the Rugby World Cup Final and tensions are running high for more reasons than one Why does Jake, the first team prodigy, leave the room every time Jonny Wilkinson takes a kick? Why has Dave stopped drinking? And why have only seven people turned up to watch the game of the century? This sparky and engaging comedy returns to that golden morning in 2003 when the unthinkable happened and England were victorious.",
