    "introduction": "This is the story of Marie-Louise Chatelaine, from childhood through marriage and emigration: a twentieth-century saga that takes us from Burgundy to Alsace, from Alsace to Germany, Holland and finally Argentina. What does it mean for a woman to lose her parents and make a family of her own, only to end up alone? What does it mean to move from country to country, from language to language? A Woman is a cinematic essay about identity. A search into the wounds of exile and a reflection on the function of memory. A haunting and intimate portrait of the director’s own mother. It is the story of an imitation artist, trying to adapt to the challenges of real life… as a woman.",
