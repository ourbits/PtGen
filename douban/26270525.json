    "introduction": "\"Boccioni’s Bike\" is a personally animated lyrical interpretation of the movements of a bicyclist depicted in the graphic style of the Italian Futurists. “Boccioni’s Bike” is also a homage to the wheel and to rotational movement, the basis of our passing mechanical civilization.Finally, not about a bicycle, but about acceleration.This is the first film Battaglia drew, and evidence of his learning is in the image as he drew the film \"straight ahead.\"Voted \"One of the 200 Most Important Films\" in the first 100 years of cinema culture by the National Arts Council, Australia.",
