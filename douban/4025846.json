    "introduction": "“Cargo” tells the story of a young Russian woman who is smuggled into America by human traffickers. She is driven from Texas to New York by a notorious Egyptian transporter. The film is about two very different people, who are trapped together for several days in a cargo van. They start as enemies but slowly form a certain bond, and finally see one another as human beings. So I would say that the main topic of the film is communication and empathy.",
