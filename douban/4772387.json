    "introduction": "The 1970 colour full-lengh film Badou Boy, a south-Sahara “cops and robbers” movie, “it's a part of my youthful years, many Africans empathizes with the amoral waif, the movie character that is so similar to me”, declared the director. Shot in 16mm, it won the gold medal at the MIFED of Milan and the golden Tanit at 1970 Cathage Festival.In 1970 Mambéty released his next film, Badou Boy, another sarcastic look at Senegal's capital that followed the adventures of what the director described as a \"somewhat immoral street urchin who is very much like myself\". The contest pits the non-conformist individual against an absurdly caricatured policeman who pursues the protagonist through comedically improbable scenarios. Badou Boy celebrates an urban subculture while parodying the state.",
