    "introduction": "Enjoyed in millions of British homes each Christmas eve, Carols from King's is an enchanting hour and a half of choral worship, always beginning with a lone chorister singing Gauntlett's reverent Once in Royal David's City and concluding with the triumphant Hark! The Herald Angels Sing. This release includes the full 2014 service along with an hour-long BBC documentary narrated by Juliet Stevenson detailing the history of this central component of the British Christmas tradition since 1954. The documentary provides insight into the tradition of selecting the soloists, what goes on behind the scenes, what life is like for a chorister in the Choir, and the impact these experiences have on generations of choristers.",
