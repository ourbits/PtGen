    "introduction": "How do you survive in a world where the only light that feeds the meaning of life has been cut off?A group of teenagers run away from a computer game camp after group leaders confiscate their computers and cut their access to the Internet. The impossibility to escape to the virtual world makes it equally impossible to stay in the former reality. The youngsters are found 20 days later in the forest, deeply traumatised by hiding in silence and the knowledge that one of them is forever lost.In the experimental layers of powerfully poetic dramaturgy, director Piotr Stasik dissects the essence of evolving identity and the bitter price of personal development which being carved into stereotypes mercilessly claims from young people.",
