But that's not what their families expected: Jurgen's Flemish parents don't understand why their only son dumped his previous girlfriend to marry a colleague; while Sibel's Turkish brother is agitated by her impulsive decision. Jurgen and Sibel look forward to their big day. But are they marrying just each other, or are they marrying their families as well? A comedy about French fries and baklava; about marriage and trust; about Flemish modesty versus Turkish temperament.",
