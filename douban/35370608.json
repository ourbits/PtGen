    "introduction": "Taking place in the 1930s on one of the outskirt islands of the Japanese Empire, a few \"PINGINUMU,\" or the escapees, attempt to flee from the infamous \"Green Jail\" coal mine but loose their ways in the tropical jungle. Reenacted based on true historical events, these escapees suffer from starvation, risk a brutal beat-up if caught, or if lucky, they swim to the nearby shore and regain freedom from the nightmare. They become the hungry wandering living-ghosts that are seeking a way out. After the war, locals of the island have more or less witnessed the miners' ghosts that remain wandering about, as if they were still the poor souls that lost direction.",
