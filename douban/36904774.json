    "introduction": "This documentary is a unique opportunity to peek behind the scenes of the anti‑communist activities of the 1980s underground movement in Poland. Jan Lityński, Jacek Kuroń, Lech Wałęsa, Stefan Kisielewski and others talk about the everyday life of the oppositionists in hiding and about the political reality of the era. My Notes from the Underground comprises various recordings which were collected by an informal group (Jacek Petrycki, Bohdan Kosiński and Marcel Łoziński) in 1982-87.",
