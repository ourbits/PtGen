The Series focuses on the internal conflicts in the infamous D Company, headed by Dawood Ibrahim (declared by the US as one of the Most Wanted) and its collusion with cops, politicians and the glamour industry, popularly known as Bollywood. It's a high energy crime/drama coming from the land of Slumdog Millionair.",
