    "introduction": "Complex story about a young man who inherits a broken down estate at the edge of the Peruvian desert, with no explanation about the former owners or what had become of the once thriving house. By searching through the rocks and sands for relics, he discovers the answers to the mystery, told in flashback. The film combines the boy's search with other socio-economic issues relevant to Peru in a confusing, but insightful manner. The photography of the desert is stunning. The only Peruvian film ever nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film (1972)",
