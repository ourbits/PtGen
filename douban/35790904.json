    "introduction": "If we put poetry and cinema / face to face /what would they talk about?A young poet visits / an old poet / they become friends / the old poet dies / and the young one take care of her things.Some filmmakers visit / the young poet / read poems / by the old poet / visit streets and bars.The old poet talks / in her poems / to the young poet and the filmmakers / to all poets / and all filmmakers / we don’t know what / the old poet / would say about a film like this.A poet dies, and another one, younger, feels an obligation to promote her work. She is joined by a team of women filmmakers. The films begins with this unusual triangle but, interestingly, it grows into something more complex and subtle than a traditional research project. Predictably, questions arise, but so do revelations and almost clandestine moments of beauty and lucidity, along with a persistent sense of uncertainty that ends up becoming a goal in its own right. Thanks to this unexpected approach, Juana Bignozzi appears in this film in all her glory, invincible and very much alive: the film triumphs.",
