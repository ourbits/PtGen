    "introduction": "Skinny-dipping, hot summer kisses and an unexpected secret are just a taste of the drama to come in this frothy, tart and refreshing comedy about a group of gay Indian men.Achieving a milestone in Indian cinema, this is the first openly gay male movie from India and is an eye-opening exploration of gay sexuality and relationships in a culture far from accepting. This heartfelt melodrama begins when gay fashion designer Kamlesh (Ankur Vikal), reeling from a recently ended relationship, invites a group of friends ― both gay men and straight women ― for dinner at his parents' lavish summer home to gossip about their love lives ― or lack thereof. The situation reaches the boiling point when his sister Kiran (Rinkie Khanna) arrives with her new fiancé Ed (Atul Kulkarni), a man with an explosive secret.The action whips into a frenzy as the sexual tension builds and skeletons fly out of the closet. Writer/director Mahesh Dattani's colorful directorial debut (based on the play he wrote, On a Muggy Night in Mumbai) is a breezy, tangy and colorful peek into the contemporary life of Indian gay culture.",
