    "introduction": "From her belly injections in anticipation of a possible pregnancy she's not even sure she wants, to invasive and frightening chemotherapy treatments, to hair loss or medical appointments for a potential chest reconstruction, she documents everything. Marie-Philip, forced to go back to live with her parents for the duration of the treatments, confides, under the watchful and delicate eye of filmmaker Geneviève Dulude-De Celles. Her fear, her pain, her anger, but also her joys, hopes and dreams... The young woman opens a window on her intimacy and relationships with overwhelming honesty. For more than a year, we shared with her this human experience, in all its ups and downs, diving without false modesty or sensationalism into a medical process softened by the unfailing support of her family. Each step then becomes an opportunity to measure her courage, her strength of character, her humor and her sense of resilience, but above all, every moment spent with her, every smile and every tear, compose an ode to life of irresistible strength.",
