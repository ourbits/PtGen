    "introduction": "The Mahmoudis live in an old large house. They are a traditional couple with traditional values and beliefs. When they decide to renovate the building they call on the architect husband of Mrs. Mahmoudi's niece. But when the architect arrives it quickly becomes apparent that not everyone is on the same page regarding the renovations. Conflicts arise about the house and about related matters. Indeed, even unrelated matters. Slowly we begin to understand that the people in the house, residents and guests, are all torn between modern and traditional lifestyles.",
