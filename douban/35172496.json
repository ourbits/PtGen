    "introduction": "Saara (35) and Robert (32) are high on their love. Just recently Robert moved from Berlin to Helsinki to give their relationship a real perspective. Their love is a constant play with gender role clichés and power relations, yet behind the unconventional façade, both have to struggle with their fears and insecurities. Looking forward to a time-out, the two set off to an extensive summer holiday on a lonely island in the Finnish archipelago. Triggered by the rough nature, the couple falls back into archaic patterns they are desperately trying to overcome.",
