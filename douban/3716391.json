    "introduction": "Rob is a good man, he never promised anything or lied to either his ex or local prostitute,Lou (Davis) - he may want to keep her at arms length but he wants the best for her. He has however a detachment to life that some would find admirable, some would find strange. He and his wife live in an \"open\" relationship, they are quite loving and seem to have a strong relationship, but she has a young lover while he quite happily seems to stay at home reading a book when shes out. Lou, the junkie prostitute is quite puzzled, even surprised about this aspect of their relationship. He is fairly unshockable, not at all condemning of the prostitute and her lifestyle. But Lou has a very lonely life,and is looking for someone to reach out to. A quirky film from the master, John Duigan.",
