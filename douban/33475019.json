    "introduction": "Avenida Almirante Reis em 3 Andamentos documents this major artery in the city of Lisbon. We map it throughout the 20th century focussing on the memory of the area it covers and on the experiences that took and take place in it. Almirante Reis Avenue could work as a time machine. We run it up and down resorting to archive footage, going back to its opening in 1908 and to the crowded Republican rallies. We watch Labour Day in 1974. Between 2016 and 2018, we record its everyday life following those who live and work there.",
