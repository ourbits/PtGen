    "introduction": "An arid landscape in which various people move around: a girl walks along holding a goldfish in a glass of water, children have fun with an empty bath tub, people at their window observe what’s happening. And finally, rain. Drought is treated with realism and oneirism in the filmmaker’s first work, made when she was still a film student.",
