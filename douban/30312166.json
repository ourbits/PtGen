    "introduction": "This gripping and dramatic 3x60' series uncovers how the Nazis took control of Germany.How did 20th Century Europe’s most liberal democracy fall into the hands of fascists? From Hitler’s political scheming that turned Germany’s parliament into a House of Cards, his War on Truth leading to book burning, and his scapegoating of minorities, this series explores in extraordinary detail the events leading up to the outbreak of World War II.The series will be made in the style of the RTS award-winning ‘Elizabeth I’s Secret Agents’. Leading historians will study the motivations of Hitler’s contemporaries - to get into the minds of the people most responsible for the machinations of the Nazi regime - as well as those who sacrificed their status, their jobs and in some cases their lives to try to stop the Nazis. Interweaving their different psychological perspectives will allow us to experience their different ambitions and agendas.This series will show that history is not inevitable. As our historians take us through the biggest events of the period, from the Wall Street Crash to the backstairs dealings of the 1930 election, from the brutal Night of the Long Knives to Hitler becoming the all-powerful Führer of Germany - we highlight the incremental decisions and missed warning signs that could have prevented the rise of the Nazis.",
