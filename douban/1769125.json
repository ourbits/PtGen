Jeremy had friends Mr. Raven (who was a bird) and Hector (who has a rat). Each show lasted 15 minutes - Jeremy went on adventures around the world and to outer space.In Norway Colargol lives in Eventyrskogen (in English: Eventyr= Fairytale, skogen= Forest)Voices: In Norway Rigmor Lange was Colargol. She even won \"Spelemansprisen\", a music award for the Colargol record in 1974.  The English voices: Colin Jeavons, Charles Collingwood, Gwenllian Owen, Percy Edwards杰利米,是只爱唱歌跳舞的小熊,提着一个什么都能变的小箱子周游世界,还爬到了月亮上.她总是在唱我是小熊杰里米聪明能干又伶俐会唱小调DO RE MI我就是小熊杰里米鸟王听了我的歌十分高兴对我说送你一只小魔哨吹起哨来 嘀~ 嘀~ 嘀我就是小熊杰里米 (记忆有缺失)这部挪威的COLARGOL《小熊杰里米》，从1984年开始停播，到了1996的时候，几乎所有人已经对它遗忘了。那时候，任何网站都找不到它的图片和歌曲。可是，你知道吗？它的作曲甚至得过“Spelemansprisen”的音乐奖。小熊杰里米，从遥远的挪威来到中国，虽然，无论片内片外，都经历了太多我们知道或者不知道的挫折。但是，我们永远不能忘记，杰里米的开朗向上的精神。BARNABY THE BEARBarnaby the Bear's my name,never call me Jack or James,I will sing my way to fame,Barnaby the Bear's my name.Birds taught me to sing,when they took me to their king,first I had to fly,in the sky so high, so high, so high, so high so high. Soif you want to sing this way,think of what you'd like to say,add a tune and you will see,just how easy it can be.Treacle pudding, fish and chips,fizzy drinks and liquorice,flowers, rivers, sand and sea,snowflakes and the stars are free,la la etc...............So,Barnaby the Bear's my name,never call me Jack or James,I will sing my way to fame,Barnaby the Bear's my name",
