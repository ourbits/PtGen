    "introduction": "Unlike many other documentaries or series that examine the life of Hitler, this series seeks to provide new perspectives through the use of colour footage. For example, it is widely known that Hitler did not get into art school, however this series reveals his failure was due to a lack of courage, having hardly prepared for the entrance exam. This attribute, one of little courage, is drawn upon time and time again: Hitler twice threatened to kill himself, firstly due to the failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923 and secondly, after the discovery of Hitler's involvement with his half-niece Geli Raubal, the newspapers accused him of sexual perversion. Another example adding to Hitler's cowardice, was a picture used to show him on the front lines of the putsch in a white coat, while all others were in black. It was in fact a fake and created as part of the Hitler Myth in reality, he was said to be cowering behind a bodyguard who was killed in the failed uprising.",
