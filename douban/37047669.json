    "introduction": "In 1978 Włodzimierz Puchalski sets off for Antarctica to fulfil his dream. The structural axis of the film is Puchalski's sea voyage to Antarctica, which was aborted by his death on 19 January 1979 on King George Island. It is interwoven with Puchalski's relationship with his daughter. Puchalski documented his life until his final moments. Footage from this journey contains actual film archives, scenes recreating life on the ship, and additional found footage. Puchalski kept a cricket in his cabin as a companion. It became the film's co-narrator, providing an additional layer of context. My film tells the story of a man who risks everything to reach Antarctica: \"an untainted and pure land – a paradise on Earth\". I'd like to tell a story about true passion and its price.",
