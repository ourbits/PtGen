    "introduction": "Upon arriving in South Korea to look for her father who has been absent since her childhood, Soa Sung-a Yoon, the filmmaker, is confronted to a past full of enigmas and for which her relatives seem unable to bring answers. This gap motivates her need and her will to re-create her intimate story out of other people’s words, whether familiar or barely known, and from pictures of movies, TV shows or “dramas” that stage the reunion of missing people. The juxtaposition of those elements sheds light on the past of Soa Sung-a Yoon, while reporting on a period and the mechanism of a society. In a dual motion, the movie depicts the fantasized portrait of an absent father, while including the personal story of the filmmaker in a wider one, the story of a community deeply scarred by separation.",
