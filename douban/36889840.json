    "introduction": "In 1996, Ricardo López became obsessed with the Icelandic singer Björk, chronicling through video tapes his extreme disillusionment in learning that her personal life and romantic relationships didn’t align with his racist perception of who she was. López created an elaborate scheme to send Björk a package rigged with sulfuric acid with the intent on killing her; at which point he would commit suicide so that they could be together in the afterlife. Thankfully, the package was intercepted by police and no harm came to the singer. However, López was found dead in his apartment. Comprising solely of crime scene photos/reports and video diary entries, this archival documentary chronicles the final days in the life of Ricardo López.",
