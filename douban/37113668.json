    "introduction": "Two little birds. One white, the other black. When the two relatives encounter a new bird, boasting begins. Who sings more beautifully? Who has the most splendid plumage? Which of them will catch the newcomer’s eye? It’s all destined to resolve itself… in a thoroughly comical manner. Feathers will fly!In the short film series Two Little Birds by Soderguit and Schettini, animation directors of Uruguayan descent, playful mixed-style animation lines shine alongside timeless, concise observations on society. Even if it is crafted as a miniature for the youngest viewers, the episode about feather flaunting will deliver unexpected laughs for more mature audiences as well.",
