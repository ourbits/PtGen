Twenty years have passed since the 1994 Genocide that left 1,000,000 Tutsis dead. Predominantly orphans, the cast of young Rwandans, led by a stunning, strong headed Juliet, tackle their country's past and their own future as hopes, expectations, pasts, personalities and cultures collide as opening night approaches.",
