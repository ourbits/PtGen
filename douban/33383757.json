    "introduction": "Diz a Ela que me viu chorar is a film about love and humanity in a tragical context. Downtown São Paulo, Brazil. Apartment Building: 7 floors, 28 rooms, 107 residents. What they have in common is the abusive use of crack and, in most cases, their skin color. The film shows life in the building, a social residence that is part of a damage reduction program about to be extinguished. We closely follow the characters on their hallucinated hunt for bonds, fighting for life with obsession.",
