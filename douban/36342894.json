    "introduction": "The fiction series is a raucous satire inspired by the real-life goings on behind the scenes when politician Gro Harlem Brundtland came to power in Norway in 1981. The power struggles and backroom bickering in the show bring to mind “Veep” and “In the Loop.”Brundtland was the first female prime minister of any Nordic country, not just Norway, and one of Scandinavia’s leading figures in the fight for women’s rights, gender equality and abortion rights, with a standing on a par with Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Gloria Steinem in the U.S., or Simone Veil in France.",
