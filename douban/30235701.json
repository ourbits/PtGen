    "introduction": "Deep rooted religious beliefs seemingly going back to the Pilgrim Fathers’ Puritanism dominate a society which is entertained by violence no end on a daily basis. If it is true that American movies reflect American society the United States have yet another severe problem: a lack of open sexuality and eroticism. After the Hayes Code had faded away Hollywood exploited the newly found freedom in films like “Basic Instinct” and “Body Heat” to name but a few. But when Reagan and Bush came to power the public attitude to sex changed again. Clara and Julia Kuperberg are demonstrating how the American film industry correctly reflects these changes in behaviour. Carefully selected film clips ranging from “Basic Instinct” and “Midnight Cowboy” to “The Last Tango” underpin a narration woven together from interviews with those who are in the forefront of sexual liberation. Needless to say that relevant TV series like “Mad Men”, “Californication”, “Masters of Sex” and “Sex in the City” also feature.—Poorhouse International",
