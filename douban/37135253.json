    "introduction": "August 1960. Director Nikolay Berentsev is working on a large-scale sci-fi film about an expedition to Venus. Construction of grandiose decorations begins in the pavilion. Berentsev himself develops models of planets and spacecraft, and comes up with special devices for combined filming. Tries to imagine and visualize something that no one has ever seen - life on other planets. He believes that fantasy should run ahead of science, but he faces skepticism from his colleagues and the scientific community. In the end, he himself begins to doubt whether the audience needs his film, why these dreams of Space, when there are so many unresolved problems on Earth.",
