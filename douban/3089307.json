    "introduction": "Finished by Jesus Franco and Patxi Irigoyen in 1992. (Orson Welles died in 1985).In the 1950s, Orson Welles  shot some scenes featuring himself as \"Orson Welles, the film director\" and then little girl 'Patricia McCormack' as a child named \"Dulcie\" (after Dulcinea), which will be introduced by Welles in the world of Don Quixote. These scenes aren't present in this Jesus Franco version.According to Spanish film critic Juan Cobos, who had watched an early rough cut of the movie while Orson Welles was still filming material for it, this new version cut and reshaped by Jesus Franco doesn't resemble Welles' vision at all.The film doesn't include all known footage of Don Quixote. There is footage being privately held in at least two collections in Europe.In the unfinished doc, Filming the Trial, Orson Welles said that if Don Quixote was ever finished, he would have called it \"When are you going to finish Don Quixote?\"Unlike other unfinished Orson Welles films, Don Quixote's incomplete state was not because of lack of finances. Welles always considered his Don Quixote a \"private exercise\". Or as he put it, he worked on it like an author works on a novel; under no obligations, no time constraints, and could finish it whenever he feels like it.Orson Welles began filming this picture in 1955 and worked on it off and on over the years.",
