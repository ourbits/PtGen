Nirvana is in a large hospital in the center of the city and, due to severe insomnia, she has been increasingly going to places that do not exist, and is talking to people who may not be real. But without sleep, Nirvana cannot be released. Maybe she can escape, but where is the way out of this labyrinth?",
