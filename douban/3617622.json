    "introduction": "The term “freeter” entered the Japanese vocabulary in the early 90’s, just after the bursting of Japan’s Bubble Economy, and refers to educated young people who are forced to work low-paying, unskilled jobs just to make ends meet. One of these freeters, 23-years-old Hiroki Iwabuchi, an assembly line worker at the Canon plant in Saitama, picked up a video camera in order to chronicle what living hand to mouth in one of the wealthiest country in the world is really like.",
