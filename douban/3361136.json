    "introduction": "This is the story of a neglected town halfway between where you are and wherever it is you are going. Rare is the day this toilet city has a visitor, but today is one of those days. A couple of dubious neo-hippies take a grand tour of every little shit stain the town has to offer. Snakeville is a place where all of your dreams can be crushed, that is, if you have any. The local security guard can build a fleet of spaceships, the lonely computer programmer can befriend a magical fairy, and a couple of hood rats can find redemption... Such are a few of the many yarns that unravel in the quiet town of Snakeville.",
