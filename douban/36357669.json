    "introduction": "The resistance movement of the residents of Favela do Vidigal against an eviction order, an important chapter in the history of Rio de Janeiro in the 1970s. The popular victory, after three years of struggle, was crowned with the visit of the Pope John Paul II to the favela in 1980. This episode was decisive for the end of the large-scale removal policy put into practice by state governments in the 1960s.源自：http://etudoverdade.com.br/en/filme/51221-Favela-do-Papa",
