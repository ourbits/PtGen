In just 29 minutes, we watch her grow from a toddler to a young woman with all the beautiful and awkward stages in between. Each phase is fleetingly captured but leaves an indelible mark. Her answers to her father’s questions are just a backdrop for a deeper story of parental love and, ultimately, independence.",
