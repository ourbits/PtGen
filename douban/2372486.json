    "introduction": "This series of \"days-in-the-life\" (6) is without a doubt one of the funniest and best-acted pieces I've ever seen. The two principles, Julia Davis and Rob Brydon, have a very well-defined sense of comedic timing, and their characters are at once hilarious and pitiful.The makeup deserves credit as well; I was half-way through the second episode before I realized that I was watching the same acters. (that's \"acters\" as opposed to actors, as opposed to actresses)This is good stuff, and I can hardly wait until this is available on DVD. I just hope we can get (at least) another six out of Davis and Brydon...",
