    "introduction": "Radha (Smita Patil) and Ramu (Mithun Chakraborty) are siblings. Their parents Shyam and Sita are singers. Once, Shyam and Sita go to perform in Jalpaiguri to get some money, since they are in a poor status and they have to pay a monthly rent. While performing in Jalpaiguri, Sita catches the eye of a rich and powerful man called A.M. Singh (Amrish Puri). He stops them in the mid way home, kills Shyam and rapes Sita. Radha and Ramu get the news that their parents are dead. The house proprietor banishes them and they become homeless. Years later, Radha and Ramu have achieved success and are popular singers now. Ramu falls in love with Janita (Mandakini) and Radha gets married to Resham (Shakti Kapoor), who is their troupe member. They all sing and perform together. However, Resham becomes different and strange. He comes to abuse Radha. When Ramu comes to know that, he tries to prevent him, but Radha does not allow him to do it. Radha finds out that she is pregnant. She comes to inform her husband and finds him with another woman in their bed. She reacts angrily and Resham beats her in such a cruel way, that she passes away in the hospital. Ramu takes to alcohol in a big way, while Janita who has to perform in Jalpaiguri because of the contract, catches the eye of none other than A.M. Singh.
