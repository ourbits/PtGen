    "introduction": "A musical odyssey, the film uses Simon's own songs to tell his remarkable story. The journey lasts more than a year and a half, and takes him from his native Scotland to the other side of the world. There is freedom and happiness along the way, as his new-found masculinity flourishes, but there is also sadness and loss, as he irreversibly sacrifices his female singing voice to hormone treatment.Feature documentary Funny Kinda Guy tells the story of the transition from female to male of transgendered singer-songwriter Simon de Voil.",
