    "introduction": "Amidst a thriving Baťa-esque town, nestled in the scenic foothills of the majestic Tatra mountains, stands a factory, whose young director is, for his day (it's 1937), pleasingly modern in approach. Yet, don’t be fooled, the film’s protagonist is actually his wife Helena (Eliška Křenková). The aspiring doctor is soon to give birth, yet her resolute gaze into her family’s rosy future is suddenly darkened by the discovery of the body of a newborn baby in the vibrant factory's courtyard. Helena’s innate empathy, intensified by her pregnancy, isn’t satisfied by the conspicuously prompt solution to the mystery. A stirring detective drama with a progressive and profoundly human perspective on a theme controversial not only shortly before the unexpected war, but also decades later.源自：https://www.kviff.com/en/programme/film/63/40698-we-have-never-been-modern",
