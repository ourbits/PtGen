    "introduction": "In this dramatization of the Jonestown Massacre, one woman comes face to face with history's most notorious cult leader, Jim Jones, in a battle to save his people. On November 18, 1978, one thousand Americans took their lives in the name of revolutionary suicide, a name mankind would interchange with Jim Jones. Just days before The Peoples Temple Church fell to mass suicide, reporter Jessica Levin accompanies a United States Congressman to investigate the living conditions in Jonestown, and allegations that Jones employs psychological tricks and violence to trap his followers against their will. But the community is a sea of smiling faces that sing praises of their leader. In order to unveil the truth about Jonestown, Jessica must go straight to its heart, and confront Jim Jones himself.
