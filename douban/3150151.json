    "introduction": "The Authorized biography of Les Paul, \" The Wizard of Waukesha\". The name Les Paul is synonymous with the electric guitar. As a player, inventor, and recording artist(Paul had two #1 hits with his wife Mary Ford), Paul has been and innovator from the early years of his life. In 1928, thirteen-year-old Les Paul borrowed a phonograph needle from the family Victrola, stuck it under the strings of his Sear Roebuck guitar, and wired the contraption to a telephone mike and two radio speakers, thus achieving not only amplification but a crude stereo effect. The pioneering young musician then went on to invent scores of ingenious recording techniques, including overdubbing and multi-track recorders, as well as the solid-body electric guitar at the heart of the rock and roll revolution. Still spry at age 90, Les Paul tells his own classic rags-to-riches story in a feature-length HD documentary-with a soundtrack of greatest hits from Bing Crosby, Chet Atkins, B.B. KIng, and rock legends Jimi Hendrix, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Keith Richards and Paul McCartney.",
