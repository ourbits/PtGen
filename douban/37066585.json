Struggling with the moral dilemma of ending her unborn child's life, she decides to wait until after giving birth. Her priority becomes finding someone trustworthy to care for the baby. With her growing belly and no desire to inform her family, she leaves home one night, recalling fearless people who abandon their roots like trees. She seeks out Mahir (35), an old college friend she deeply trusts, only to find him wheelchair-bound after a neighborhood fight. Mahir lives with his reclusive father, Cemal (65), who withdrew from society after his wife left. Bahar, Mahir, and Cemal, all dealing with their emotional struggles, must navigate their complex relationships. Can a suicidal woman and a detached father-son duo find a renewed connection to life? Can autumn become spring?",
