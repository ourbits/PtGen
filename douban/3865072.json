    "introduction": "Tony Lo Bianco (G. Tinti) an American cop transferred to Italy, becomes Maurice's right-hand man. Maurice is a famous \"camorra \" boss. He is planning an assault to a post office near Naples. During the robbery, another boss called \"the panther\" shots over Maurice's band wounding Lo Bianco. Fortunately Lo Bianco does not die and he starts to investigating about Maurice's past. He finds out that the boss is protected by the Italian Secret Service because he has some important documents regarding drug traffics where Italian minister are involved. Lo Bianco finds the documents and he is ready to give it to a magistrate but he is killed before leaving Italy. This is the worst Italian crime film that I have seen. Acting is poor and actors too. The careful viewer will notice that sometimes the actors look at the camera during their dialogues. Even if the film has been shot in Italian the dubbing is simply shoddy, with false Neapolitan accent. The action is slow and boring.",
