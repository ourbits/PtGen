    "introduction": "By its title, this eight reel feature film sounds like a western, but it's not. This independent film was the first movie entirely filmed in Alaska. A dismal failure at the box office, the production company never made another film. Seen today, this film's worth is in the interesting look it provides of the Alaskan Gold Rush days, told by people who lived through it. Unfortunately this isn't a documentary, it is a melodrama involving a lost baby girl and the gold miners who raise her to adulthood. The scenery is wonderful and makes the film worth watching.",
