    "introduction": "Nowadays, \"La classe américaine\" is having a status of cult movie. But it wouldn't have been so without \"Derrick vs. Superman\", or \"Eine grosse Funf\", which was directed one year before. 1992 : \"La cinq\", the fifth french TV channel, cease to be. So, the inspector Derrick and his sidekick Klein, who were \"stars\" of the channel, decide to create his own new version of \"La cinq\". After telling Silvio Berlusconi about it, Derrick calls every main TV-character, asking them for help. Tough job : Blake Carrington from \"Dynasty\" is communist, Captain Kirk is too busy to answer, Hutch is depressed and Matt Houston just plain stupid, Commissionner Maigret doesn't want to work with somebody who farts, Navarro hates being disparaged about his accent, Michele Lee from \"Knots Landing\" is mocking Derrick and Klein... At the same time, the Persuaders (a gay couple), Number 6 from \"The prisoner\" (who took too much LSD) and Superman (the only man who can speak without moving his lips), all of them working on \"M6\", the enemy channel, don't want Derrick to succeed. And they will do anything for it... Even killing Charlie's Angels with an H-bomb.Sixteen minutes of pleasure and craziness, but the best scene is the one with Navarro which lines I can't wrote here : too much foul words in it for the site ! A good way to know what was \"the Canal + humor\" of its first decade (Les Nuls, De Caunes et Garcia, etc...)",
