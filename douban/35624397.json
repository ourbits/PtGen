    "introduction": "When did World War II begin? Shanghai: 1937 answers that question in a way most audiences will find surprising. Americans might say December 7,1941 - The day the Japanese Imperial Navy attacked the American naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. For Europeans, it was September 1, 1939 - When Nazi Germany invaded Poland But in China, people will tell you a different date. August 13, 1937. That day, after a century of humiliation, and six years of repeated \"Incidents\" initiated by the Japanese military, China at last \"stood up.\" This act of defiance took place in Shanghai, the most international city in Asia. It was headline news around the world. Today, the story is largely forgotten - except in China. The Battle of Shanghai has been described as the last battle of World War I, and the first battle of World War II. It was a warning to the world, a warning that was ignored. And it was the place where the destiny of modern China was set in motion. Still, at its heart, this is a story of shattered lives, and enduring dreams.",
