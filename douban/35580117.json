    "introduction": "In 1973 Stanley Kubrick came to Ireland to shoot Barry Lyndon (1975) creating great excitement in and around Waterford. The film brought jobs, scams, candles, stories and ultimately trouble to the local people. Infamously a threatening phone call drove Kubrick, his family and the crew from Ireland and this romantic comedy follows the lives, laughs and loves of an Irish extra playing an English soldier and a young British crew member in amongst the travelling circus of the Hollywood crew - star crossed lovers from different sides of the camera track. Who made all the candles? And who made that call?",
