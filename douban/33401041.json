Investigative reporters from The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Hollywood Reporter follow the money as it travels across the globe, financing everything from luxury real estate and decadent parties to Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street. Capturing white-collar crime at its greedy best, The Kleptocrats is tale of embezzlement, scams and greed run amok.",
