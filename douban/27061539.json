The shorts feature a number of well-known actors – Emmy Rossum, Cynthia Nixon, Schwimmer himself among them – acting out the degrading scenarios familiar to too many women.A female patient is subjected to the ministrations of a sleazy doctor. A young female artist finds herself in conversation not only with a famous actor, but also – and without her invitation – his penis. A model is bullied to sexually humiliate herself for a photographer, and a room full of people fail to intervene. It’s a campaign to raise awareness, and it’s been hashtagged #ThatsHarassment.-From the Gurdian",
