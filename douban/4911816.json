    "introduction": "Turkish filmmaker Dervis Zaim directs the black comedy Camur (Mud), his third film. The story takes place on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus near the border between the Greek and Turkish sides, where black mud in a salt-water lake is thought to have unique healing capabilities. While affected by the ancient statues lurking over them in the present, four Turkish friends deal with their memories of the war with the Greeks: Ali (Mustafa Ugurlu) is a mute soldier, his sister Aisha (Yelda Reynaud) is a gynecologist, Halil (Bulent Emin Yarar) is her fiancé, and Temel (Taner Birsel) is a restaurant owner tormented by his personal experience in the war. Mud was shown at the 2003 Venice Film Festival as part of the Upstream competition. (Andrea LeVasseur, All Movie Guide)Born in 1964 in Famagusta, North Cyprus, Dervish Zaim graduated from Warwick University. He took a course in independent film production, organized in London by the Hollywood Film Institute. In 1995 his first novel won the prestigious \"Yunus Nadi\" literary prize in Turkey. Tabutta Rövasata (Somersault in a Coffin) is his debut as director and screenwriter. (IMDb)",
