In each season, adventurous British zoologist Steve Backshall travels around the world to select sixty of the most deadly and interesting animal species, from insects to giants, many predators, others just armed with deadly defensive means.

A few extra episodes are dedicated to extras such as 'the making of'.- Written by KGF Vissers",
