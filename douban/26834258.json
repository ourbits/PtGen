    "introduction": "For the minister's son, this is a summer of awakening and acceptance of his homosexuality. For his father, this is a challenge to his roots in the bible as he interprets its posture on sexuality that drives him to 'save' his son by killing his lover. In a broader exploration of 'acceptance', a play-within-the-film recalls two landmark tragedies in the history of gay culture: the murder of Mathew Shepard, and the suicide of Tyler Clementi. An intertwined story traces an Erie Canal cruise operator's challenges in starting a 'gay' cruise in conservative Upstate New York. The message, 'Accept what you can't change.'",
