    "introduction": "The show was divided into 2 seasons. In 1961, it was aired in the first season as \"Instant History\" with 312 episodes, each being just 3 minutes long. The second season \"Otogi Manga Calendar\" aired 312 episodes, with each being 5 minutes long. While it was the first series ever broadcast on TV, it should not be mistaken as the first anime ever broadcast. Three Tales was the first Japanese anime shown on TV, while Tetsuwan Atom was the first 25 minutes anime series.",
