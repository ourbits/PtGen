    "introduction": "After a holiday visit with his parents, Mikey is headed to the airport to return to his wife and newborn baby. Except he doesn’t board the plane. Instead he returns to his parents’ loft in lower Manhattan, back to his childhood room that has since been converted to storage. Unsure of his own motivations, he makes up excuses about why he’s staying – his flight is delayed, his flight is cancelled. A day passes, and then another, and he calls home and work to say he can’t return just yet – his parents are getting old, his parents are ill, time is too short. His doting mother is more than happy to enable his procrastination, while his artist father is suspicious. From afar, his confused wife grows increasingly unsettled. Meanwhile Mikey moves back into his room, digging out notebooks and mementos, calling on old friends. As the days go on he becomes more and more entrenched in his adolescent sanctuary, and comes to a point where he must choose between life as it is and life as it was. --© Official Site",
