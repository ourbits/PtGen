    "introduction": "Darren Maxwell became addicted to collecting Batman merchandise in late 1980s Australia as a way to be a part of nascent geek culture. Decades later, Darren's stuck with a room full of collectables - a membership card to a fandom he no longer recognizes - yet powerful forces beyond his control mean he's unable to let go. BATMAN AND ME is a sobering look at the highs and lows of obsessive collecting in an increasingly pop culture-centric world, and the price of admission to fandom. Written by Melbourne Documentary Film Festival",
