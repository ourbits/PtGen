    "introduction": "What good is freedom if you can’t afford it? As the Berlin Wall tumbled across the Eastern Bloc in the 1990s, it drew aside the Iron Curtain’s repression and physical containment of Hungarian citizens. The borders to the rest of Europe, and indeed the world, were now open—but only for those who could afford the extraordinary cost of travel. With nothing to lose, three young tricksters happen upon the fact that the distinctive blue ink used on international train tickets allows for easy forgery. Soon, these accidental kingpins of a capitalist syndicate find themselves caught in the wheels of an old-school communist police investigation. Droll animation tells the little-known story of an unlikely gang that valiantly tripped open the West for a new generation. Watch incredulously as the cops crack the scheme but not the youthful spirit of self-determination in this comical tale.",
