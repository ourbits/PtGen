    "introduction": "This provocative first person documentary chronicles Celia's quest to get to know her father, famed verite documentarian David Maysles (GREY GARDENS, GIMME SHELTER w/ the Rolling Stones, SALESMAN) who died when she was seven. She comes up against an unexpected roadblock when the other half of the Maysles Brothers, her Uncle Albert, refuses her access to the Maysles Films archive. A thoughtful family drama that examines a legacy of filmmaking and loss, passed down generation to generation.",
