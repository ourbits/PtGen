    "introduction": "他几乎没有通过慕尼黑戏剧学院的试镜，但有一位老师承认他的才华：“他有两样东西：力量和天真。”让我们试试看！1930年出生的马里奥·阿多夫（MarioAdorf）开始了他的演艺生涯，他成为了他那一代人中最受欢迎的演员之一。这部电影描绘了他生命中的重要阶段：他的童年生活在埃菲尔山上的一个小镇梅恩，在那里他和他的单亲母亲一起长大；他在慕尼黑的第一次戏剧体验；以及他在罗伯特·西德马克的《纳克茨，温德·特乌费尔·卡姆》（The Devil Strikes at Night）中的第一个成功的电影角色。在这位欧洲影星的传记中，罗马和巴黎的城市是永恒的。他曾与雷纳·沃纳·法斯宾德和赫尔穆特·迪特尔合作，但他与国际喷气式飞机和慕尼黑的Glitrati保持着距离。阿多夫经常扮演恶棍。2018年，他在电视剧《德意志预言家》中扮演卡尔·马克思。他目前正在准备一个名为“zugabe”（“encore”）的告别之旅，其中包括歌曲和诗歌。一部关于一个充满激情的男人和演员的电影，他以一种意气相投和自我讽刺的方式分享他的世界观、职业、爱情和变老。He almost failed the audition for drama school in Munich, but one teacher recognised his talent: ‘He possesses two things: strength and naivety. Let’s give it a try!’ And so began the career of Mario Adorf, born in 1930, who became one of the most popular actors of his generation. This film charts the important stages in his life: his childhood in the small town of Mayen in the Eifel mountains where he grew up with his single mother; his first theatre experiences in Munich; and his first successful film role, in Robert Siodmak’s Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam (The Devil Strikes At Night). The cities of Rome and Paris were constants in this European film star’s biography. He collaborated with Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Helmut Dietl, but kept his distance from both the international jet set and Munich’s glitterati. Adorf was often cast as the villain. At an advanced age in 2018, he played Karl Marx in the TV docudrama Der deutsche Prophet. He is currently preparing for a farewell tour entitled ‘Zugabe’ (‘Encore’) which will include songs and poems.A film about a passionate man and actor who shares his view of the world, his profession, love and growing old in a congenial and self-ironic way.",
