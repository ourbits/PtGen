    "introduction": "Multi award winning, comedy superstar, John Bishop is back with his brand new DVD. Recorded during his mammoth 150 date sell out tour of UK & Ireland at the iconic London Palladium in 2018. Here on this very DVD, you too can experience him 'Winging It'!John shares his opinions on the royal family and how Kate Middleton could have been Mrs Bishop. You'll find yourself carried along with his brilliantly observed feelings about hitting the big 50, how to deal with the 'empty nest', the menopause, the moment he finally managed to impress his mates with his fairly new found fame and getting a 'name-check', live on stage in Boston, from his idol Bono!His everyman style of delivery make the 90 minutes pass in a flurry of belly laughs and nostalgia.",
