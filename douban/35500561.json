The original series followed a group of therapy patients with supernatural abilities as they uncovered the secrets of their therapist, Dr. Bright. Six months after \"The Bright Sessions\" concludes, we begin again with \"The AM Archives,\" a Luminary exclusive that tracks the mysterious Dr. Bright as she tries to reform the institution that once betrayed her. Along with time traveler Sam Barnes and ex-enemy Owen Green, Dr. Bright helps Atypicals learn how to use their abilities. But in an effort to defang the Atypical Monitors, the trio comes face to face with a patient unlike any other.",
