    "introduction": "Jerusalem the summer of 1976. The lives of Noa, a 12-year-old girl and her friends change when the mother of Danny, a neighbor, is a passenger on the plane hijacked to Entebbe. Noa’s plan is to kidnap an innocent Arab boy as a negotiating card for the release of Danny’s mother. Once done, her plan becomes increasingly complicated as the youngsters discover the Arab boy is flesh and blood with feelings like them. This film examines the relationship of what happens at home and the violent reality of the world in which we live. This is a compelling drama that lances your heart as you feel the children’s deep emotion, desperation and struggle for justice.",
