RAINBOW'S END is a revealing and entertaining multinational journey from the center to the borders of Europe. It also shows exciting footage of the gay and lesbian manifestations in Warsaw and Cracow (Poland). Touching personal stories and social, religious and political insights. From street activism to the highest political scene at the United Nations in Geneva (Switzerland). A must see and a starting point for the most relevant discussions about the future of lesbian, gay and transgender people within Europe and throughout the world.",
