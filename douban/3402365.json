    "introduction": "Two men dance a pas de deux in the living room of a flat; the music is Mahmoud Ahmed's song 'Erè mèla mèla.' The men are nearly twins, one blond, one dark-haired, and much of what each does mirrors the other. Through the wonders of stop action, they glide in tandem; socks, trousers, and sweatshirts move from one to the other and back. It is at once a dance of athletes, of lovers, of a team, and of two abstractions. At the end, they roll up inside a rug with large red circles; when the rug unrolls, they have become flattened cutouts that blow away. White clouds pass outside, seen from the window of the flat, against a blue, blue sky",
