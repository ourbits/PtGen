    "introduction": "The 1970 Formula One season was the 24th season of the FIA's Formula One motor racing. It featured the 21st World Championship of Drivers and the 13th International Cup for F1 Manufacturers.Thirteen races were held between 7 March 1970 and 25 October 1970, with the Championship won by Jochen Rindt and the constructors' title by Lotus. Rindt died four races before the end of the season, but had earned enough World Championship points such that no other driver managed to surpass his total by the end of the season. It is the only season to date in which the World Championship title has been awarded posthumously. Jacky Ickx driving for Ferrari finished the season strongly, but a 4th-place finish in the penultimate round ensured that Rindt's title lead would stand. In the end, all of Rindt's points came from his five wins.",
