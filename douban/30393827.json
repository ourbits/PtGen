    "introduction": "Ep1  Florence - Mercato CentraleThe Mercato di San Lorenzo, or Mercato Centrale (Central Market) in romantic Florence, is Tuscany's true gem, as here, there's only one motto: taste, in all its glorious simplicity and authenticity.Ep2  Toulouse - Marché Victor HugoUnquestionably, there's no better place than the centrally-located and well-covered food market of Marché Victor Hugo to get a general view and to feel the beating heart of Toulouse's vivid food scene.Ep3  Zagreb - Dolac MarketIn the bustling farmers' market of Dolac in the city district of Zagreb in Croatia, one can't help but feel the air of a bygone time, when old ladies used to sell fresh vegetables and exquisite cheese.Ep4  Riga - CentraltirgusRiga's Centraltirgus in Latvia is Europe's largest market and food bazaar. Only a hair's breadth away from the Art Nouveau Old Town, unexpected discoveries await, such as grilled lampreys, rye-bread making, and fresh berries.Ep5  Freiburg - MünstermarktThe Freiburger Münstermarkt, or the Freiburg Cathedral Market, is a lively open-air food market in the heart of the old town, and a wild parade of vibrant colors from the flower stalls and the wide variety of fresh produce.",
