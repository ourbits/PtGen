A life long friendship。After a wildlife painter spots Bigfoot in the northern wilderness and takes photographs and videotapes the encounter, a frantic chase begins between a ruthless businessman who will stop at nothing to acquire this “prize,” offering a million dollars for Bigfoot’s capture dead or alive, and an anthropological team bent on capturing him for the sake of learning more about evolution.
