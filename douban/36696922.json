    "introduction": "1943 - the air war waged by Allied bomber units over Hitler's Germany is approaching its climax. A group of young high school students aged between 15 and 17 from Berlin are drafted into the Luftwaffe to serve as air force helpers in a heavy anti-aircraft battery. The boys enthusiastically move to the anti-aircraft battery and are happy not to have to go back to school for the time being. They enjoy training with the light and heavy caliber anti-aircraft guns and quickly learn how to use them, feeling like full-fledged soldiers.During a major night raid, the position is hit by several bombs - only one of the boys, air force helper Kurt Carow and a soldier from the canteen barracks survive the inferno. Carow stands crying in front of the destroyed bunker barracks for his fallen comrades. It is November 24, 1943 - the Second World War would last another 531 days.",
