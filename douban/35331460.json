    "introduction": "Lena loves the ocean. Battling the wind and waves on her sailing boat, she is as passionate and fearless as her father on his fishing expeditions. But one day, he and the rest of his crew do not return. Some say it was an accident; others say he had been reckless. Lena is sure it could not have been his fault. They must have encountered a gigantic sea creature, causing the boat to capsize. The signs are everywhere: from a shadow in the water, to a large tooth stuck in a piece of driftwood. If only she could find that one, decisive piece of evidence, she could stand up to her family and friends and prove them all wrong. Thus begins a requiem of rage and a tale of letting go and of holding on – to the inexplicable, and to one another.源自：https://www.berlinale.de/en/2023/programme/202306940.html",
