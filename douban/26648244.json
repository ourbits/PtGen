    "introduction": "What can you really say about 'Rape Panic Mansion'? Other than, why the fuck is it not already on this blog? Seems odd, as it really should be.Anyway, it is in Japanese with no subs, even though the credits are all in English.Seems to be about a Japanese lady that gets abducted on her way back to her apartment, and endures hours of rape and mind-fiuck games at the hands of some of Emperor Hirohito's cruelest motherfuckers. And, it being Japanese, of course the heroine comes to be defined by this horrifying event.Couldn't find any info on this one, so if someone can find it, I'll post it! Enjoy!",
