The excitement of the two brothers is tempered by their present lack of resources. Rosalie has little regard for either of her nephews, and she determines to outlive them both. Paul decides to win over his aunt, and he soon moves in with her. The two brothers then look for a way to kill her without arousing suspicion.",
