    "introduction": "This film presents the German account of the Polish Campaign of 1939, and as such is an interesting part of the historical record of the Second World War. From the fierce fighting in Danzig, to the struggles along the Vistula, Warta and Bug rivers, to the Siege of Warsaw, the viewer can get an instructive understanding of how devastating the German advance was on the Polish forces. The combat footage, shot by the famed Kriegsberichter and their cameramen, is absolutely first-rate, and it set the standard for all other combatants' efforts in this genre during the war. Compared with the American \"Battle for San Pietro,\" for example, the footage in \"Feldzug in Polen\" is much better in terms of the cameramen capturing dramatic moments. Good editing is another highlight. Succinctly stated, this film is a military buff's delight.",
