    "introduction": "Once, the stage at concerts of “Einstürzende Neubauten” appeared like a construction site. The spectator was literally observing the band at work. Chainsaws, jackhammers and engine parts were their instruments, metal pipes and all kinds of discarded metal served as drum-substitutes. In the spotlight, one of the most extroverted and glamorous individuals of Germany’s musical history: Singer Blixa Bargeld. The film is a journey with Blixa into the past, but also into present. We accompany him to the most important sites of his biography in West Berlin and visit the new spaces of his creative work.",
