Born under a cursed fate due to their parents' original sin, one must die for the other to live. To avoid this, they have deliberately cut off contact. However, when Yi-do, who works for a gang, gets stabbed, Il-do somehow hears about it and rushes to donate blood, saving his brother's life. But instead of gratitude, Yi-do attacks him the moment he sees him.",
