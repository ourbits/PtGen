    "introduction": "According to Aristotle, the best tragedies are conflicts between a hero and his destiny. They contain reversals of fortune, moments of recognition, and, ultimately, a catharsis. Dr. John Nash's life -- his early brilliance, his struggle with mental illness, and his slow, willful recovery -- is definitely the stuff of Greek tragedy. He describes his experiences, in these excerpts from an in-depth interview.Randy MacLowry, producer and co-writer of A Brilliant Madness, talks about his experiences making a documentary on John Nash. He shares some of the misconceptions he had about schizophrenia, the challenges of conveying the emotional aspects of Nash's story and the ideas behind a few of the shots in the film.",
