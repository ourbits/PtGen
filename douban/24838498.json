    "introduction": "Dozens of luminaries from rock, soul and country gathered at the Meadowlands Arena on October 3, 2012, for an incredible tribute to Levon Helm, The Band s late drummer/singer/mandolin player (who passed away in early 2012). The concert, directed by bassist Don Was, was an opportunity to say a final farewell and, in the process, raise money for the ongoing Midnight Ramble series of concerts still held at The Barn, Helm s famous home-studio in Woodstock, New York. One at a time or, sometimes, in pairs, rock-royalty took turns in the spotlight over the course of the evening, singing songs associated with Levon Helm and The Band including \"Up On Crippled Creek,\" \"The Shape I m In,\" \"Life is a Carnival,\" \"Ophelia,\" \"The Weight,\" \"Rag Mamma Rag,\" \"I Ain t Got No Home,\" and \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down.\"",
