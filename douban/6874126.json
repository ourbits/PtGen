    "introduction": "In the Spring of 1958. Alice, Marianne and Christina, three women from different social classes in a small industrial community somewhere in Sweden, despite their differences together, and together with some other women, start a book club. What first begins with discussion about contemporary literature emerge soon in a joint writing, where women of a diary of daily events, thoughts and discussion on the chauvinistic society they live in. The innocent writings turns out to soon be anything but smooth. Soon the entire society is shaken, where hidden secrets coming to the surface and the beautiful family facade easily crack and lifelong friendship takes root. Written by Sjöman Production",
