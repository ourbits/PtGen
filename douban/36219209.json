    "introduction": "A frank and generous portrait of the folk legend and activist with the incredible voice who, at the age of 82, continues to fight the good fight. A visual diary from a cultural icon.In a sun-drenched cabin in Woodside, California, the directors meet the now 82-year-old Joan Baez. She is one of the 20th century’s greatest folk singers and activist voices, and in the autumn of her career she contiunues to shine. ‘Joan Baez, I Am A Noise’ is structured as a visual diary anchored in Baez’s extraordinary archive, including newly discovered home movies, diaries, artworks and sound recordings. At the same time, the singer is remarkably honest and revealing about her life on and off stage – from her lifelong psychiatric struggles to her myriad activist causes with Dr Martin Luther King and others, to a heartbreaking romance and musical partnership with a young Bob Dylan. A searingly honest look at a living legend who has never told the full truth about her life – until now.源自：https://cphdox.dk/film/joan-baez-i-am-a-noise/",
