    "introduction": "Josip is a goalkeeper. Known and loved among football fans as is befitting for a goalie on the brink of middle age. Enough to be in a relationship with an influencer whose everyday activities are watched by several stadiums worth of people. Fame also surrounds Josip’s teammates who are living their life to the fullest. And not just ordinary fullest, but gold-hued fullest.As a result of an accident, the security network of social and material assurance suddenly disappears from around the goalkeeper. Josip falls on a skiing trip and now has to undergo rehabilitation at a sanatorium. In this world filled with tedious and meaningless chatter, Josip assumes the role of an outside observer.The new distanced perspective helps him overcome the fermented boredom of routine and offers excitement until the moment it meets its reflection. Although Josip is not recognised without his football clothes, all the fans know his nickname – Condor. With his notorious broad sweep, Josip has fully earned his nickname. But why is the mirror now suddenly showing him a pelican? And anyway, is that necessarily a bad thing?On the backdrop of social satire, “Pelican” places a naked ego in front of the viewer. The captivatingly offset dramaturgical approach is enhanced by an unwavering camera direction. This sharp and deeply perceived tilt makes “Pelican” a remarkably effective debut that leaves a mark on the viewer’s very self.",
