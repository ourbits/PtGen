    "introduction": "The story is as follows: while holed up indoors, bored on a rainy day, DinsiemE receive a mysterious package containing a video game, “Il viaggio leggendario”, which sucks them into another dimension known as Leggendaria. Separated following a clash with the evil Doctor Timoti, the two learn to act according to the logic of video game levels rather than the usual laws of physics. During their journey, they stumble upon the courageous Princess Ginevra and the philosopher Plato who help them to face up to Sir Romualdo and Captain Sarrangia. Erick and Dominick realise they must defeat Doctor Giniu, Doctor Timoti’s brother, who seeks to overthrow Romeo and Isabella, DinsiemE’s twins and the legitimate sovereigns of Leggendaria, in a challenge which takes place in the Royal Palace, on the game’s very last level.",
