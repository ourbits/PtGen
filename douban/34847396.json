    "introduction": "The arrest of Haji Jalaluddin in the middle of his sermon struck deep into Hamid and Halimah’s hearts. It sparked their resentment, already fueled by their respective marginalized background, and launched them into a consolidation to resist the authority. The film is Asrul Sani’s loose adaptation on Hamka’s phenomenal novel, Di Bawah Lindungan Ka’bah (Under the Protection of Ka’bah), mixed with Hamka’s other thoughts through his other writings, as well as Asrul Sani’s own modernism. The film prominently portrays Halimah as one of the most progressive woman character in Indonesian film history.",
