    "introduction": "Host Laila Ali challenges chefs to settle their disputes in a single round, head-to-head culinary battle. The food world is filled with bold chefs with egos as big as their resumes, employees who have been wronged by their boss, restaurateurs defending their livelihoods from copycats, and owners whose staff walked out during busy dinner shifts. They all come here to call each other out, put their favorite knives on the line, and bury the hatchet. The winners walk out with $10,000 cash, a prized knife from the losing chef's knife roll and bragging rights for life!",
