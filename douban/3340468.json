    "introduction": "Three years prior to Pina's death, she and Tanztheater Wuppertal are trying to trace the phenomenon of their global success. Much of this documentary portrays the revolutionary methods of the greatest German choreographer Pina Bausch: no script, no libretto, no pattern. Everything you see on stage was created in improvisation during rehearsals, during which Pina set no rules, she only asked questions. Every dancer could point the piece in any direction. This is why the film doesn't show only the fragments of finished works, but also images of rehearsals and interviews with the choreographer and her co-travellers.",
