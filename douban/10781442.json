    "introduction": "Directed by Krzystek, 80 million is a kind of Polish Ocean’s 11, some reviewers are saying. A subject - martial law - one might not think easily lends to a fun caper, the film is about a group of Solidarity activists trying to take money out of a bank.80 Million is set in Lower Silesia at the beginning of the very cold winter of 1981. After a series of entrapments by the Security Services a confrontation between the opposition and the communists seems to be inevitable. Just before the proclamation of martial law on December 13, 1981, a group of young Solidarity activists decide to take 80 million zlotys of union money out of a Wroclaw banks before the account is blocked. Security Service officers follow their steps. Thus beings a grippingstory of cat and mouse.",
