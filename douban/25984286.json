These unveiling of a monument during the Occupation stirred up the topic course, mainly omitting the name Christos Kannavos who was killed in the area. Periklos (V. Diamantopoulos), a conservative journalist from high school, came to clash with his wife Elpida (A. Matzourani), even with their two sons Sokratis (N. Kalogeropoulos) and Dimosthenis (K. Tsakonas) which defends Chrysanthi's selfishness (Eirini Kazakou) and her family to put a crown in memory of Kannavos.",
