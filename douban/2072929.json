The Captain relies on three allies: his loyal partner, his fiancee, and a retired kung fu master (Simon Yuen) who happens to be his fiancee's father. However, he must also contend with corrupt staff members and a local kung fu teacher working with the outlaws. After arresting Chan, Captain Ai must hold him prisoner until the Commissioner returns to town. Things get harder after the hostile Deputy Commissioner appoints a man in cahoots with the outlaws as Captain Ai's superior.",
