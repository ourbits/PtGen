    "introduction": "Le Mythe de la femme noire\" is a feature-length documentary about the imagery of black women in the media, from the black slave of the 18th century to Michelle Obama. It is an investigation into how stereotypes originate from slavery, and still affect the lives of black women in Quebec. These stereotypes include Jezebel (the seductress, the femme fatale); Mammie (the fat woman, the asexual mother figure) and Saphire (the angry, ambitious and arrogant black woman). This story will be told by Black women on whom stereotypes have a high impact, through interviews with fascinating experts, and through archival footage from centuries past to the present day.",
