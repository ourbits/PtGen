    "introduction": "A cry in the dark explores universal themes of love, loss, grief, healing and redemption through a unique lens. This story takes you on the journey of a young girls inability to cope with a tragic event which leaves her delusional and dangerous. The concept behind this film explores our social construction of the spiritual versus psychological debate. Are some people's convictions that they can see spirits true, or are their visions products of a psychologically fragmented, delusional mind, damaged in some way as others may counter. The director explores this debate and leaves that answer up to the audience to decide for themselves. Written by Anonymous",
