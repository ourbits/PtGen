    "introduction": "The events of the film take place in the 50s in one of the most beautiful cities in the world - blessed Bukhara. This is a story about street poets living in abandoned cemeteries, in mosques, on the rooftops.A new city is built in Bukara, an ancient city where residents live, and the model of humanity is trapped in an irresolvable struggle between the'new' and the'old'. 'New' is built on the remains of the past without respect or understanding of the past. 'New' declares itself progressive, but it causes people to lose their true worth and loved ones. In this film, more and more people love and respect eternal values and die or suffer. This vandalism was on fire in order to rebel against a new ideology.(2013 18th Busan International Film Festival/Sadullo Risimov)",
