    "introduction": "Petros, a 45-year-old office archaeologist, has just come out of a long-term relationship, disillusioned by the romantic notion of self-less love. During a visit to the ancient theater of Argos, he will meet Husam, a young Arab immigrant. What originally seems like a fleeting encounter between the two men gradually develops into a fully fledged relationship, with Husam proclaiming love to a wary but acquiescent Petros. Petros is, at the same time, involved in a matrix of relationships: Laertes and Migen, second generation Albanian immigrants, together with Alexandra form a classical music trio that Petros helps; Daniel is a gay banker, who believes only in profit; Michael is a patrol policeman, who lives somewhere between reality and imagination. The end is open and ambivalent. The last gesture will be a temporary solution, a compromise so as to bring about existential balance. What will the next move be?",
