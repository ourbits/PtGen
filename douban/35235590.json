    "introduction": "Sam is a shy, mysterious and inconspicuous teenage girl, who falls in love with Troy, leader of an ultra-violent teenage gang, who does not feel physical pain, nor knows what love is. Together, against everyone and everything, they will face a series of obstacles trying to separate them, meanwhile figuring out what love and pain are. Debuting at Curtas, French filmmaker Elsa Rysto presents a love story mediated by ultra-violence, in a modern variation on the classic story of Bonnie and Clyde – or of the more contemporary Mickey and Mallory from “Natural Born Killers”. LOVE HURTS is a simple yet sensitive narrative about the so-called growing pains.",
