A group of students are tormented by the lingering menace of Garth Stroman, an artist who had a disturbing vision fifty years prior. The pupils discover that true art can only be achieved through suffering and pain. With graduation fast approaching their celebrations turn into a twisted confrontation with medieval torture - all in the name of art.",
