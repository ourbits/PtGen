    "introduction": "Tina Turner gives an exclusive, in-depth interview to BBC Arts editor Will Gompertz, discussing the highs and lows of her extraordinary career and bringing her well-documented life story up to date. In a wide-ranging conversation, Tina talks about the tragedy of her eldest son's recent suicide, how an unexpected stroke affected the early days of her second marriage, and how her life was saved when her husband became her kidney donor. She also discusses the musical collaborations that saw her become one of the icons of the 1980s, and the abusive relationship with former husband Ike Turner that first set her on the road to stardom but also nearly destroyed her.Directors: Jordan HillProducers: Brian Aabech, Dana Webber",
