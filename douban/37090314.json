Destitute and deep in debt, Zakaria is offered a lifeline by his loan shark Yusef: impersonate the Malaysian screen icon P. Ramlee in order to entertain his homebound, time-warped sister.Small-time performer Zakaria makes a living impersonating the Malaysian actor, singer and filmmaker P. Ramlee. It isn’t a dream job in 1970s Kuala Lumpur: the real Ramlee has just passed away at 44 and his art has already been declared old-fashioned. When Yusef offers Zakaria a chance to repay his debts and entertain his sister, who believes she lives in the 1950s, under the guise of Ramlee, all is forgiven.",
