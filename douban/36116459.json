But as the neighborhood grows and gentrifies, a parents' group eager for a high school in the community seeks to close NTA and replace it with a high school campus. As Chicago Public Schools administrators and city politicians debate the future of the school, the film brings you inside NTA to meet the students, parents, and educators fighting to save their beloved institution.",
