    "introduction": "Go on the grisly beat with members of Baltimore's Crime Lab, whose job it is to record every detail of every crime scene.A bullet-riddled body lies on the street in a pool of blood. The lifeless, tattered remains of a fisherman are dredged from the harbor. Most people would do anything to avoid witnessing such scenes, but the dedicated members of Baltimore's Crime Lab go out of their way to record every detail of these tableaus.SCENE OF THE CRIME follows the Crime Lab personnel as they perform their grisly task, collecting all manner of evidence from every crime scene in Baltimore. More than just photographers, they are skilled in detecting fingerprints, sketching and gathering physical evidence. They only have one chance to get it right, for after they have left, the crime scenes are opened to the public, and the chance to gather untainted evidence is lost.This is an unvarnished look at what goes on beyond the yellow cordon of the SCENE OF THE CRIME.",
