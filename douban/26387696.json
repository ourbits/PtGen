    "introduction": "Set in urban background, the film talks about what is lost by the urbanization and small family system in contemporary China. The grandfather’s unrefined and crude characteristics in the film bring to mind again the warmest love of parents and their hometown. Despite being sick, he comes to the city from a rural village in order to take care of his grandson at his son’s request. The film deals with the cultural differences and conflicts that the old man and the boy undergo for two months which are not just their problems, but the problems of all the people who are living in the cities who have forgotten where they came from. The grandfather’s love doesn’t help himself in any circumstances and is only devoted to his grandson. It changes the boy’s soul and makes his son realize that his father’s love - one even he is forgetting - is the warmest in the world. (PARK Jong-Ho)",
