    "introduction": "Darby Clyde Fenster and Jerry Martin are a pair of penniless nincompoop-drifters who hop a freight and theyre on their way to Florida. Here is where our intrepid heroes find themselves facing one comic situation after another in this gloriously loopy Southern fried comedy-with-music. Their troubles only begin when they pass by a chicken farm and are overtaken by their pangs of hunger. The sneak into the hen house and haplessly attempt to nab some birds. This does not endear them to the farms owners and what comes next is positively too goofy to describe! The film is crammed with a pleasing blend of down-home humor and finger-popping country music. Sonny Tufts, whose reputation was ruined because of his fondness for the bottle, parodies himself in his role as the moonshine-swigging Cousin Urie (and mercifully ends his Hollywood career with this film). Boxing champ/movie comic Slapsie Maxie Rosenbloom appears as an ex-prizefighter-turned-mailman who is aptly described as \"the prize dingaling of all time.\"",
