    "introduction": "In a cross-country murder spree that ended with the killing of fashion icon Gianni Versace, “My Night with Andrew Cunanan” is a docudrama crime thriller based on real life events in San Francisco in 1997 and one young gay drunken man's encounter with him days before he would begin that spree that would earn him the dubious honor of the youngest serial killer on the FBI's Top 10 Most Wanted list. Could one decision made during that encounter have prevented the murder of five men? This cautionary tale invites us to consider whether fate can be changed by exploring 'What if…?'",
