    "introduction": "This film captures the essence of Jewish humor in this fearlessly open, prejudice-defying documentary. Through a collage of interviews and comedy routines, take us a tour of Jewish humor, from the earthy jokes of the Eastern European shtetls to the stand-up routines of U.S. comics and modern day Israel, which can't resist poking fun at its most sacred institutions.Producer: MOOVIE the art of entertainment GmbH",
