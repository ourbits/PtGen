    "introduction": "Hosted by Dennis Hopper in an entirely lucid and intense performance, this film brings up some very intriguing questions and avoids simple and easy answers, preferring to let the creators of some of our most influential movies and commercials speak for themselves about what they do and the connection between the two worlds of selling and entertaining. The documentary is divided into three sections - 'Crossing Over', about creative types who have made the leap from commercial production to full-length movies and vice versa, 'Humor', on how making an audience laugh is a simple and easy way to lower their resistance to a message, and 'Shock', covering some of the most aggressively controversial images that have been used to sell us a product.",
