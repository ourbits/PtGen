    "introduction": "V., an obsessive-compulsive young man who rarely speaks, is working as a parking valet at a hotel. His life revolves around his job, where he parks cars with a millimeter precision, and his spare time, which he spends in his methodically tidied apartment. One day, a new employee, Cosmina, invades his working space. She's the total opposite of him, a fast-talking girl, always chewing gum, and who does a lousy job at parking cars. Still, the two of them fall in love.",
