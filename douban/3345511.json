    "introduction": "As Maya Angelou narrates this powerful documentary, she reveals the story of a brave group of people who fought Hitler with the only weapons they had: charcoal, pencil stubs, shreds of paper and memories etched in their minds. These artists took their fate into their own hands to make a compelling statement about the human spirit, enduring against unimaginable odds. Features the inspiring stories and artwork of Simon Wiesenthal, the children of Terezin (60 Minutes) and Dina Gottliebova Babbitt, the artist forced to paint Gypsy portraits for Dr. Mengele and the subject of comic-book icons Stan Lee and Neal Adams “Snow White in Auschwitz”.",
