    "introduction": "Franziska Linkerhand, a qualified architect divorced and up to now a kind of \"master pupil\" of a renowned architect, moves to a small town to meet new challenges. She wants to work in an architect's bureau in her new place of residence.Franziska is a person who does not make any compromises; she makes great demands on herself. But she is also full of ideals and dreams. She would like to help build a town in which people feel good and at home. However, Franziska soon realizes the discrepancy between her wishful thinking and reality. The acting municipal architect Schafheutlin, who has long since become ossified in his ideas and norms and who, in many respects, is supposed to be Franziska's partner; quickly becomes her adversary.Because of Franziska's rigorous manner, he is, however, seized with a restlessness which is new to him. Franziska's productive creativity is infectious... She gets to know Trojanowicz, who arouses deep passionate feelings in her and he responds to her in the same way. But Franziska's uncompromising challenge is too much for Trojanowicz.Their love affair ends. In spite of this great disappointment, Franziska does not leave the small town. She has realized that a year is far too short to bring about any fundamental changes for the people.",
