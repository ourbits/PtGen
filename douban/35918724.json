    "introduction": "A coming of age story set in the rugged high country of western Wyoming, Hanna and the Buckskin chronicles the story of seventeen-year-old Hanna McNinch as she struggles to train a working ranch horse on her own for the first time. Under the guidance of her mentor and brother-in-law, Parker, a hard-ass old school cowboy whose approval Hanna is desperate to gain, Hanna steps into the round pen with a surly, untrained young mare and finds the challenge to be more than she imagined. With a great deal of determination and “sand”, the measure of a ranch hand’s grit, Hanna faces the challenge, overcoming her fears and doubt along the way to prove she belongs in the male-dominated world of cattle ranching.",
