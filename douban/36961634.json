    "introduction": "The film presents the work of Czech journalist Martin Dorazín, who reports from war-affected areas in Ukraine. In addition to informing his compatriots about the current military situation, he travels with Ukrainian volunteers to heavily shelled towns and offers humanitarian aid to the survivors. The camera brings to light not only the demands of the correspondent's daily work, but also the specific stories of the civilian population of Ukraine and their fears and grief from the unrelenting war. These encounters with victims of Russian aggression mirror the absurdity of war and the need for empathy, which is often lacking in Czech society.",
