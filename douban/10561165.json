    "introduction": "Bessie is doing the dishes when a mouse makes his presence known in the kitchen. She calls for an exterminator but Charlie refuses to pay a \"professional\" any money and is convinced he can catch the rodent himself. As usual, Charlie has overestimated himself. He tries a mousetrap which snaps shut on his finger. He grabs an applecore (which he thinks is the mouse) and gets Junior to hit it with a hammer. Junior hits Charlie's hand instead. He sets up a rifle, uses a vacuum cleaner and a dynamite stick, and finally rigs an elaborate trap, none of which successfully catches the mouse. When the exterminator finally arrives, Bessie sends him after Charlie instead!",
