    "introduction": "On the morning of their 20th wedding anniversary, Teresa's husband Sam goes for a run and keeps on running. Teresa carries on with the dinner celebrations figuring he'll show up eventually. As the evening unfolds we realize Sam ran away a year ago and Teresa's tenacity is holding onto his return. Their teenage son, Nicky, gives the party a bit of magic as he spikes the food with some hallucinogenics causing a wide variety of effects on the dinner guests. After a lot of laughter, tears and awkward embraces, Teresa realizes the truth about Sam's departure and what it means to say I Love You.",
