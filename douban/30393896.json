    "introduction": "Two sisters’ lives are in limbo. In their youth, Nene and Ava were a singing duo. Now there is a child, a job at a café, a boyfriend, and their mother, who is still critical of them. One sister secretly arranges a gig for both of them, and the other smashes her life to pieces because of a feeling. Suddenly it seems possible and necessary to leave one’s comfort zone. Accompanied by an original jazz score, images dance about as they tell the story of a symbiotic love between sisters, of irrationality, of staying close and letting go. The most beautifully cinematic young piece from Germany this year.",
