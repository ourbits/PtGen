    "introduction": "In 1987, Jorge Malla, a 16-year-old boy, accompanied by his parents, signed a contract with a multinational company to record an album with his group, Los Ronaldos. When the group broke up, the young solo artist found himself with no one to back him up as a musician and having to start from scratch, literally. More than 30 years later, many albums, concerts, kilometers, flops and wins, that boy who one day wanted to be a solo artist, has managed to make himself and has won a loyal audience that follows him in each of his creations. This is his story, Coque's and Jorge's.",
