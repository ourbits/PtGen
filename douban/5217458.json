    "introduction": "Dan Horgan, a California environmental artist, has spent 30 years creating art in the wilderness. In this film, he creates his first ever public piece, and in doing so, reveals the reasons he spent so many years alone. Tracing his personal trauma back to his experiences as a Marine in Vietnam, the story of his art begins to be revealed. And in witnessing the success of his public piece, we see the way his artist journey has healed him, and brought him back to society on his own terms.",
