    "introduction": "Being gay, young and conservative, Mario Röllig is one of the most in-demand witnesses to the atrocities committed by the GDR. He guides groups through today’s memorial site in the former Stasi prison where he was once incarcerated. Röllig confronts GDR aficionados and is also confronted by people who still believe in social utopias and who also talk about freedom (without ever mentioning the GDR).The film unveils a strange atmosphere of misunderstandings and failures to communicate. Mario still awaits an apology from his tormentors while simultaneously being ridiculed by some hardliners.The process of coming to terms with the past has just begun.",
