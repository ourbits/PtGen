    "introduction": "\"Eva runs wild\" is successful Czech comedy from the end of thirties based on a novel by Fan Vavrincova. It's one of the best movies by Martin Fric (like Kristián or Tri vejce do skla). It is a nice story about one young lady Eva who wants to steal the instructions for planting the strange roses (invented by her neighbor). Eva means to give it to the aunt as a present to her coming anniversary. She pretends she is an excellent secretary and enters in the family house of neighbors... There is also another plot: Eve's brother is bound to play a role of English aristocrat in this house. There are many comic situations rising from this plots. The movie is witty, the humor of it is loose and crazy and atmosphere of it is appealing. This mood associated late summer with its warm nights and jaunty plays. The performances are great. Natasa Gollová is both beautiful and wildly crazy. Her joyride contrasts with lightly ironic behavior and mature quiet of Oldrich Novy (in a role of her brother). The music by Kamil Behounek and Jiri Traxler is also perfect.",
