    "introduction": "Iván (García Pelayo) is a Spanish film producer who travels to Argentina with one unique mission—meeting Carmen Trevilla (Lucía Seles), a cult director who’s in the middle of the creative process for her new “video.” From the very beginning, he feels captivated before her overwhelming, baffling presence. Although he doesn’t know if he’s going to produce her -because he thinks her cinema will not be well-received by current European sensibilities-, Iván seizes each of his moments with Carmen to capture, cell phone in hand an an endless smile on his face, every adventure they embark themselves on—from railway theater rehearsals, talks about Ricardo Bochini and Jean-Luc Godard, pennant purchases and excursions to hardware stores, to podcast recordings about hates, motorcycle trips and Argentine football match broadcasts.源自：https://www.mardelplatafilmfest.com/38/en/pelicula/la-proxima-pelicula-de-carmen-trevilla",
