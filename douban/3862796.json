    "introduction": "Robert Blake is the main star, a boxer who's been ripped off by his trainer, sold out to a thrown fight. this happens in every boxing movie, or most of them. it's even mentioned in ON THE WATERFRONT, a boxer getting sold to throw a fight and thus, dismissing a promising career of being a champion. that's sort of what this movie is about, but mostly it's a wrongfully accused peice of fluff-antique, pulpish entertainment that, although it looked as if it cost ten dollars to make, kept me somewhat interested. it's sort of fun to watch. the parts that are corny, like the overdubbed voices (of everyone 'cept the two leads), are a funny as hell, like watching those old kung fu movies only now it's boxing and it's Italian in lue of Asian. Ernest Borgnine gets second billing but he's not in the movie much. he's a cop who's after Blake and appears after about forty-five minutes. the second main character is Blake's buddy, some Italian actor no one's ever heard of (in this country), who's low, tuff voice doesn't fit his meek appearence - as often happens with dubbed movies. all in all RIPPED OFF had me watching - and hooked - from start to finish.",
