    "introduction": "Laura Wagner has a promising career as a young auctioneer, but her life looks set to fall apart when she's the victim of a rape. The rapist is a well-known and respected gallery owner, and the assault takes place after a cocktail party. Laura knows it's unlikely she'll be believed if she files a complaint. But that same night the gallery owner's wife is murdered at home, and the husband is a suspect. His alibi is that he was raping Laura. When the police ask Laura to confirm the alibi, she realizes she can take her revenge by letting her rapist be convicted of murder",
