    "introduction": "12 Explosions shows a series of tableaus filmed in Vienna at night. Before the big bangs occur, the locations selected for them resemble crime scenes: There are shots of dimly lit footpaths, deserted parking lots, a pedestrian bridge made of steel, all with a central perspective. These places are virtually waiting for something to happen. And because of the film’s title we know that something will.",
