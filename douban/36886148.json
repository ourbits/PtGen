    "introduction": "In 1985, Pol Pot is on a slow retreat; he's in Cambodia's Battembang Region. Four men hide in a darkened room. Pol Pot enters with his deputy, security chief, and a general. The four men in hiding, without conviction, say \"Surprise.\" A banner says \"Happy birthday.\" A cake and candles appear; the four sing \"Happy Birthday\" without spirit. The intern is given a piece of cake to taste for poison. Then, all are served a slice. A few presents appear: the deputy unwraps a neck support pillow, a book about management, and a decorative stand reading, \"Don't ask me I just work here.\" The leader wants all to get back to work, but an aide brings one more gift: a puppy. A good gift?",
