    "introduction": "Director Serge Ioan Celebidachi spent one year filming his 80-year-old father, Sergiu Celibidache in various activities, including the man at work conducting Mozart's Requiem, Bruckner's Symphony No. 9, and Bartok's Concert for Orchestra -- unusual because Celibidache has always refused to record his work. The conductor was also interviewed in his garden, and after a lengthy two-and-a-half hours with him, viewers will better understand this sometimes controversial man, alternately accused of being a dictator or a genius, but who clearly has a deep love and talent for making great music. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, All Movie Guide",
