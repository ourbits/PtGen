    "introduction": "Poland, 1981. A group of young people have a dream: to have a car, be free and go on a trip to the seaside. They are not really into politics, religion or economy even though shelves in shops are empty and it is impossible to get a passport. When they are having fun, somewhere near them Solidarity is protesting in the streets; and their car, falling apart, becomes the metaphor of the falling state. This animated road movie documents Poland during the communist era. With a sense of humour, in a comic book style and with Polish music in the background, it shows the story of people trying to evade martial law.",
