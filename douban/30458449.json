    "introduction": "年轻的萨摩亚人索洛的工作是在20世纪20年代西萨摩亚的新西兰殖民地本土法庭上为非英语萨摩亚人翻译。索洛怀疑地看着他的同胞们，发现自己越来越被自己的职责和社会所撕裂。当一位年长的女性首领努（Nua）大胆地拒绝配合殖民地合法统治的叙述时，索洛不得不面对他在帮助巩固殖民统治方面的个人角色。当镜头停留在丽露的主人公的脸上时，它捕捉到了痛苦和冲突、挑战和复原力。Young Samoan Solo’s job is to translate for non-English speaking Samoans on trial before the New Zealand colonial Native Court in 1920s Western Samoa. Eyed suspiciously by his countrymen, Solo finds himself increasingly torn between his duty and his community. When Nua, an older woman chief, boldly refuses to play along with the colonial narrative of legitimate domination, Solo has to face up to his personal role in helping to bolster colonial rule. As the camera lingers on the faces of Liliu's protagonists, it captures pain and conflict, defiance and resilience.",
