    "introduction": "Join Tristram Hunt for coverage of the Art Fund Museum of the Year Award 2017. As the newly appointed director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, winner of last year's award, Tristram has to prove his mettle running such a large institution, with tips and advice garnered from his visits to the 2017 finalists - London's Tate Modern and Sir John Soane's Museum, the Lapworth Museum of Geology in Birmingham, the Hepworth Wakefield and the National Heritage Centre for Horseracing and Sporting Art in Newmarket.This year's list of nominees showcases yet again the extraordinary range of museums across the UK, with temples to science, history, sculpture and modern art all making the cut. By visiting them each in turn ahead of the announcement of the winner, Tristram learns just how the sector is in such fine fettle this year.",
