    "introduction": "A century ago, the poet Ekalavya Sen fell victim to deception by his peers, who shamelessly plagiarised his poetic works. Seeking retribution, Ekalavya orchestrated their demise. In a race against time, poet and sleuth Abhik Bose teams up with Rabindra Sangeet singer Hiya Sen to decode a century-old mystery, triggered by a vengeful poet's message. As they delve into a web of murders echoing Rabindranath Tagore's life, they unearth hidden artifacts, a nefarious plot to undermine India's cultural heritage, and a truth that could reshape history.源自：https://www.iffigoa.org/rabindra-kabya-rahasya.php",
