    "introduction": "Life Behind The Wall looks at the now extinct German Democratic Republic fifteen years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The now extinct German Democratic Republic (GDR) experienced a worldwide resurrection with the cinema success of films such as Good Bye, Lenin! To mark the 15th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall,Life Behind The Wall conveys the history of the East German state in a unique and honest way. Through the eyes of people who have gotten to know the East German state from many varied viewpoints.Life Behind The Wall features new sources of previously unreleased footage, including amateur's films, photos and documents that show a very different image of the German Democratic Republic. Life Behind The Wall is the work of a unique team of young authors,directors and scientists from both east and west Germany who seek to portray a candid depiction of what forty years of life was likeunder socialism and behind the Berlin wall.",
