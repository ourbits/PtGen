    "introduction": "Sometime, hopefully not too soon, in a place wherever but not here, all life will have moved underground after a failed uprising. Everybody wears a mask, more often than not of the variety seen only at Halloween these days. In this scary universe (that on closer inspection looks like a twisted, perverted version of our here and now...), a man with a gorilla mask is searching for a little boy with a hessian hood. His quest leads him into a maze of depravity, a pandemonium of all our nightmares and darkest desires – where something awaits that he had already given up on: love.2551.02 – The Orgy of the Damned is as unique as it gets: a dream-like horror movie that is wordless but full of music and noises. A tribute to silent cinema and its aesthetics that never tries to imitate the cinema of a century ago but creates a modern, disturbingly contemporary poetic from its themes and tropes. This makes 2551.02 – The Orgy of the Damned as much a darkly trippy avant-garde piece as a full-blown scare fest for every genre aficionado.",
