    "introduction": "\"Askeladden og de gode hjelperne\" is yet another of Ivo Caprino`s classic animated films based on Norwegian fairytales. Askeladden is a well known character in old Norwegian fairytales and if you ask people on street to mention a character from Norwegian fairytales, Askeladden will be the name mentioned by most of them. In this movie Askeladden will try to build a ship that can fly, because the King wants such a ship, and the award for the man who can give him such a ship is half the kingdom and the princess. And that is a price that Askeladden wants and as in all fairytales the hero succeeds not only because he is nice but because he helps other people. And the animation is also excellent as in all of Ivo Caprino`s movies. A must see",
