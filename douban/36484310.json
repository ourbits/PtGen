    "introduction": "Du Jie, who had been in the spotlight as a cinematographer for blockbuster commercial films in China such as No Man’s Land (2013), SAVAGE (2018), and Moon Man (2022), emigrated to Japan three years ago where he completed his directorial debut, The Height of Coconut Trees. The film follows two couples. A man working as a cook in a restaurant and a woman working in a pet shop are in a long-term relationship and often eat lunch together in the park during their lunch break. One day, the man finds a ring swallowed by a fish and gives the ring to the woman as a gift. The other couple consists of a woman who has already committed suicide and a man who has acquired the old inn where she killed herself. Tension arises when the woman who received the ring visits the old inn, which is the space of the other couple. Seeing the woman visiting the inn alone, the inn owner suspects she might commit suicide and starts following her. The film tells an original story as it moves between past and present, man and woman, reality and ghost.",
