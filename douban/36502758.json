From county shows and village fairs to fertility dances and ancient ceremonial gatherings, she seeks out the community heartbeat of each village. She meets remarkable characters and joins in with everything from dangerous carriage driving events to vegetable gala competitions along the way, showing how even the horn dancers, cheese rollers and tree kissers of this world benefit from the continuance of these traditions.Her journey takes her to some of the most picturesque and hidden landscapes in the country, spanning the stunning location of Steven Spielberg’s War Horse, Castle Combe, and the site of the original English Country Garden, through a village that hasn’t changed in a century, and even to the Queen’s own vegetable patch at Balmoral.Join Penelope on her mission to find out why we love villages so much; what’s disappeared, changed and stayed the same and what’s the secret to their longevity?S2 E1 - Devon and CornwallS2 E2 - CumbriaS2 E3 - Royal DeesideS2 E4 - Sussex and Kent",
