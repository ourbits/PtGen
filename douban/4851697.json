    "introduction": "This movie is very good. It features a middle age working class man that comes back to visit his parents. the neighborhood is ruled by a gang called the hammers. when they murder his father he is forced to take over the family owned business. did i forget to mention that this guy is also an ex military guy trained in urban extractions? The Gang is mostly old school Latinos. I say this was well worth the 2 bucks i spent. I have watched this movie twice. includes drive by shootings. crucial beat downs and torching. There's a new power on the street. One of the gangsters wears a hair net, its pretty funny. as i continue to ramble on i do suggest this movie. if you only like high quality movies than just pass this one by. If you can handle some cheese than find this movie and watch it!",
