    "introduction": "On an amorous tryst with a young girl, an inexperienced young man has his bliss interrupted when the girl's lover startles them. In the ensuing fracas, the lover is fatally shot. The young man admits that he fired the fatal bullet, and the young girl becomes a credible eyewitness for the prosecution. Against these overwhelming odds, the father of the young man faces a dilemma. In Somnauth Narine's, Protection Game, the father, played by veteran actor Mahadeo Shivraj, must decide whether to operate within the confines of the law by using the services of a high priced lawyer, or operate outside the law to protect his son. In this murder mystery heightened with suspense and bawdy West Indian humor, love, devotion, and adherence to law, which appear to be at the opposite ends of the spectrum of human emotions, converge to answer the eternal question- How far would a father go to protect his son?",
