    "introduction": "Ron Jeremy shows off his personality, humor, and enthusiasm for life in new documentary produced by Vito Glazers. What started as just an ordinary documentary turns into a valuable life lesson for a group of up and coming filmmakers, the audience, and even Ron himself. While following the aging adult star through his daily routines, and helping him put on his first stand up comedy show in Chicago, viewers get to see a side of Ron and learn about his background through a series of candid interviews and behind the scenes footage that will inspire and motivate viewers and leave the audience falling in love with a Ron Jeremy they never knew existed. The story of Ron's journey proves that no matter who you are, what you look like, where you are from, or where you are at in life, you can reinvent yourself and achieve anything. Follow your dreams and reach for the stars.",
