    "introduction": "Film and stage actress Ingrid Caven is also a singer. During concerts she alternates between Kurt Weill, The Beatles, Erik Satie, Schönberg and texts written for her by Rainer W. Fassbinder, Hans Magnus Enzensberger and Jean-Jacques Schuhl (winner of the 2000 Prix Goncourt for his novel based on her).In this concert we hear several new pieces, including an electronic composition created by Giuseppe Giuliano using her voice recorded over an excerpt from Rose Poussière by J.-J. Schuhl, who has written new SONgs for the occasion with Peer Raben, the composer behind the scores for Fassbinder’s films.",
