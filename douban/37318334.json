    "introduction": "Maisie Adam performs her 2024 tour show, Appraisal, filmed in her hometown at The Harrogate Theatre. It's been a meteoric rise through the comedy ranks for Maisie and she's fast on her way to becoming a household name. Stand-up is what she loves most and she's now five years into her job as a comedian, so perhaps she's due an appraisal. Appraisal is the ultimate performance review, where we see just why she is an award-winning comic... or is she heading towards an \"organisational restructure\"?",
