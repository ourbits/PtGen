The film brings life what was intentionally omitted from the archive, shedding light on the blackout strikes that were broadcast across Ireland and Britain in response to media censorship.源自：https://iffr.com/en/iffr/2024/films/few-can-see-----------Few Can See examined the legacy of broadcast censorship of the conflict in the north of Ireland and political movements during this era. The project attempted to recreate material absent from state archives due to censorship, based on contemporary oral history interviews.源自：https://www.eva.ie/event/eva-international-at-belltable-a-few-can-see-by-frank-sweeney/",
