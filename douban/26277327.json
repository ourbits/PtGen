    "introduction": "Once upon a time….there was a little pig made of porcelain, French in origin. More precisely made in Sèvres. And with an illustrious past. He had been produced by an old white bearded man, not like any piggy bank produced without love and in a chain of industrial manufacture. He was painted with spring time flowers by a young artist. He had been used by families of some means. But human taste is unpredictable and the nineteen fifties had created a whole load of pigs from outer space with geometric designs. There then began his descent in the order of pig-like matters. Very happily, he has now discovered a haven of peace amongst poor yet friendly hands, and more than anything HE IS BELOVED! This story recounts his last days.",
