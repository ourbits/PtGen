    "introduction": "The tension never ceases to mount in Loïs Dols de Jong’s riveting thriller NL-Alert. Struggling to get home to her stranded baby, a young mother in Amsterdam receives an emergency alert on her phone: a nuclear missile has been launched at the city and residents have forty-five minutes to evacuate.With a sharp eye and an admirable economy of expression, NL-Alert crisply anthologises human reactions to calamitous news: distrust, followed by confusion and paralysis, climaxing in all-out panic. Characters face moral dilemmas and life-or-death choices, yet the film remains focused on concrete actions that unfold from moment to moment. Employing a frenetic, often claustrophobic cinematography, NL-Alert thrusts the viewer into a doomsday scenario that, through sheer accumulation of detail, becomes chillingly palpable.",
