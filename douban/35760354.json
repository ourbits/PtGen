    "introduction": "Memphis is wild at heart. He lives on the edge, pursuing his dreams with grit. But as a young man with cerebral palsy, living without government support, Memphis feels stuck. Saddled with their own baggage, Memphis’ parents waver between supporting his desire for independence and pushing him towards a more pragmatic reality. Seneca, his best friend, struggles to reconcile her own big ambitions with her small town life – and her relationship with Memphis. Shot over five years, debut director David Zucker’s Your Friend, Memphis is an intimate portrait of Memphis’ dogged determination: to bridge the distance between the world’s expectations and his own aspirations, no matter what.",
