    "introduction": "Mia, an isolated law student in New York, is compulsively drawn to self-harm and pain. Mia has entangled a classmate — Simone, a friend, who’s also more than a friend — in her experiments in pain. But when Simone breaks things off, Mia’s back on her own.When her first night home alone proves too difficult, Mia heads out to a local bar. There she meets Josie — a young, native New Yorker, who feels warm, at ease, and in control. But she might be in over her head with Mia…As the night progresses, both women must decide if they’ll allow the connection to take them each somewhere new.源自：https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/films/2196739",
