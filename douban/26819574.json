Their apprehensions about throwing the party are universally validated when their divorced mother and father as well as both of their ex-boyfriends converge on the party, leaving tragedy in the wake of what they had envisioned as a unifying celebration. In the aftermath of this fateful night, Elle and Joy are left with the sobering yet liberating truth that they can only rely on one another.",
