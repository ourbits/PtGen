    "introduction": "Through the eye of his camera, the director leads us on a voyage of discovery: people, places and sounds. The film is an artistic attempt to create fiction through the use of real life images and editing. Part 1 East is shot in Moscow, Talinn and Orsk Novotroisk. Part 2 Far East is shot in Uzbakistan, Afghanistan, Inner Mongolia and India. Written in two movements like a musical score, Kinogamma meanders in a melodious evasion. From a slow movement based on a bluish arpeggio, it slips into a staccato rhythm followed by an orangey-colored trance. A melody rises and the camera lovingly films the poem, embracing unfamiliar faces.",
