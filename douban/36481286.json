    "introduction": "Oksana Shachko ended her life in 2018 in Montrouge. She was 31 years old. Despite her young age, this extraordinary personality had already lived several lives. She was one of the three co-founders of the FEMEN movement, which appeared in Ukraine 10 years earlier and a committed artist. She was the first to show her breasts in a demonstration, thus inventing the standard gesture that will symbolize the FEMEN. From Ukraine, she arrived in Paris in 2013; she was then a major figure in a movement that had become planetary. However, the country of human rights does not give her the expected welcome: she goes from disappointment to disappointment and her situation becomes precarious. However, she continues to fight and paint.",
