    "introduction": "In Long Story Short, Christine Choy recounts the professional lives of Larry and Trudie Long, a pioneering Asian American vaudevillian couple of the 1940s and 50s, whose popularity on the Chinatown nightclub circuit eventually wins them a spot on The Ed Sullivan Show, at the time the pinnacle of show-biz recognition. Their daughter, actor Jodi Long, who wrote and narrates the documentary, is moved to record her parents’ memories and experiences when she wins a part in the Broadway revival of Flower Drum Song—her father appeared in the original production over 40 years earlier. The film also chronicles the behind-the-scenes struggle of the pair to forgive the injustices suffered by Asian Americans during World War II, a particularly difficult problem for Trudie, who was incarcerated in Japanese internment camps. Theirs is a tale of fortitude, of overcoming and challenging media stereotypes, and the personal cost of leaving behind a legacy of positive change.源自：https://hotdocs.ca/whats-on/hot-docs-festival/films/2023/long-story-short",
