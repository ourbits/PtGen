He's contemplating closing down the theater. His son, William Jenkins Jr., believes he knows how to revive the theater, and convinces his father to at least let him try his idea without elaborating on what that idea is. It is to put on a kiddie revue. He has the support of Ms. Marlow, the owner of the dance school where the kids are students. Junior believes the show will have a built in audience of the kids' large families. The kids being the performers and advertisers and Junior being emcee may mark a new generation and life for the Palace.",
