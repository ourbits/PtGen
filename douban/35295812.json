    "introduction": "Igor has been seriously depressed since his ex-girlfriend Marie became an Instagram celebrity thanks to an activist group focused on the female orgasm. Igor thinks this is a deliberate campaign to prevent him from finding someone else. One day, his friend Arnaud visits him, and Igor tells him that he feels personally attacked, as Marie sets him an example when referring to past unsatisfactory sexual experiences. As Arnaud doesn’t believe him, the two decide to visit Marie to try to clear things out and assess the validity of Igor’s theory. “We’re Not Animals”, which marks the debut of the French director Noé Debré in Curtas, is an intelligent and scathing comedy about modern disagreements, mismatches and misunderstandings, with a surprising set of characters and situations that defy expectations. In this film the most embarrassing scenario is always disarmed by humor. (JA)",
