    "introduction": "Oldrich Danek, the scriptwriter for \"Hic Sunt Leones\", who made his debut as a director in 1960 with the officially irreproachable \"Three Tons of Dust\" (\"Tri tuny prachu\"), also turned to history - \"The Nuremberg Campaign\" (\"Spanila jizda\" - 1963) - to seek metaphors for the present. In 1967, Danek made his best film, \"The Royal Blunder\" (\"Kralovsky omyl\"), a fourteenth-century tale about the relativity of despotic power.Historical material was by far the best medium for Frantisek Vlacil, who in 1967 completed his unique reconstruction of thirteenth-century Bohemia, \"Marketa Lazarova\", based on the novel by V. Vancura. Supported by the photography of B. Batka, he achieved an almost flawless recreation of a period that hovered between paganism and Christianity and filled it with authentic portraits of people from another civilization.",
