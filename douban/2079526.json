    "introduction": "A woman kills her boyfriend and the woman he's sleeping around with after they had sex which she recorded (original). After this she starts to get obsessed with sex and killing, and she gets more excited every time and is going mental while she seeks her own identity.One of the strongest points of the movie are the extremely offending scenes and trust me they will offend you. The level of controversy is truly amazing.The negative side of the story is that this movie is somewhat forced, it clearly was designed to be controversial and sometimes it's hard to go along with the story.The filming is perfect, very dark and regularly uses her personal cam, which greatly adds to the realism of the film (like Blair Witch, only selected scenes). Also the director uses a scene where she drives in a car during the night every time her level of mental behaviour advances. The main character is very well played, Natali Broods shows to have no limits to her acting, she'll do anything and she'll do it well, truly amazing (she needs to work on her English). Also the dialogue is perfectly mixed, very strong humour at the cruelest moments.This movie is most certainly worth your time. Go watch, I promise you never saw this before and you can't predict how the story will evolve.The movie is definitely a work of art worth watching. However, experienced movie viewers only.",
