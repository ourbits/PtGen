    "introduction": "A large room. On a scene a pile of hammers. 301 to be precise. A man enters, gloved handed. He grabs a hammer and breaks another with it. And so on until the whole but one has been destroyed. Here is the show: simple and tedious, slow and of long term. Easy to understand: it is all about work. Li Binyuan as a modern Sysyphus: obvious endeavor, paradoxical glory of this vain task, work returned on and against itself. Now another operation, as destructive, remains open: interpretation.
