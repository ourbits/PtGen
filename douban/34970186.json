    "introduction": "In the Indian State of Kerala, a number of Communist parties still wield considerable power today. The basis for this was laid in the 1940s and 1950s, when left-wing leaders led an uprising against the oppression of workers and farmers. The divide-and-rule tactics, used by tyrannical bosses, was symbolised particularly by the ‘chappa’ system, practised in the Mattancherry district of the port city of Kochi. This meant that day labourers were forced to fight one another for metal tokens entitling them to work. Union meetings were broken up by force.The Harbour shows how two brothers end up on opposing sides of this system. One becomes the leader of an employer’s gang of thugs, while the other becomes an activist. All the while, the women in their family go hungry and the community is ravaged by violence and alcoholism. In this epic film, featuring a generous helping of fight sequences, the struggle for social justice and the desire to make the best of your life are two sides of the same coin.",
