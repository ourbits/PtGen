    "introduction": "With the 1989 documentary portrait Katia Et Volodia, French filmmaker Dominique Delouche pays unbridled tribute to Vladimir Vassiliev and Ekaterina Maximova, who held court for many years as the most popular and celebrated dancers in the company of Russia's esteemed Bolshoi Ballet. The pair gained such popularity, in fact, that their fame outstripped the boundaries of Russia itself and enabled them to net fans around the globe. In her cinematic reflections on Maximova and Vassiliev, Delouche draws from such resources as archival documents, classic footage of the pair in motion, and glimpses of their considerable success and fanbase. Delouche created this film just prior to the fall of the Soviet Union. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi",
