    "introduction": "Australia's Tony Krawitz (Jewboy, The Tall Man) directs the adaptation of The Slap author Christos Tsiolkas' award-winning novel in this searing film about history, guilt and secrets.Ewen Leslie delivers a great performance as photographer Isaac, whose father's death in suburban Sydney reveals the schism in his family and prompts a return to the ancestral homeland.On a trip to his parent's village in Greece, he learns something of his father's cursed history.At first he dismisses the revelation as superstitious nonsense, but over the course of his travels - from Greece to Paris to Budapest - Isaac is forced to confront the anti-Semitism of the past, the embedded bigotry in the bones of Europe and the nature of inherited guilt.It is on this fateful trip that Isaac will learn the truth of his family's migration to Australia, their refusal to ever return to Greece, and the burden he continues to bear as a consequence of acts committed years before his birth.Krawitz sensitively depicts this clash of mythology and a very contemporary reality in this daring and enigmatic film populated by spirits and outcasts.",
