    "introduction": "Lasers ignited a successful nuclear fusion reaction for the first time. But there are quite some obstacles to overcome to move nuclear fusion technology into something we can really use. What forecast is realistic?The nuclear fusion breakthrough has raised high hopes for clean power. This documentary shows the context behind the breakthrough. It explains nuclear fusion, one of the most complicated things you can imagine, in a way that a broad audience will be able to understand what it really means for us. The audience will be impressed by the huge and complex international fusion experiments. Watching and maybe smiling about the artistic graphic animations, they will grasp what's going on in a nuclear fusion reaction, why it is so hard to create it on earth and how the different nuclear fusion approaches try to make it happen.Produced by hr, arte",
