    "introduction": "Bruno Mars has soared to fame from struggling songwriter to international superstar. Having performed at the 2014 super Bowl halftime show alongside the Red Hot Child Peppers, Mars cemented his status as a global icon. Mars began his journey at a young age, performing at various musical venues in his hometown Honolulu, Hawaii. He didn't find success however until he started writing songs for other artists such as Flow Rida's smash hit \"Right Round\" and Travie McCoy's \"Billionaire\". Mars finally broke out as a singer in his own right in 2010 with the single \"Nothing On You\". Now, with over 45 million singles sold worldwide and over one billion views on YouTube, Bruno Mars is going from strength to strength. This is Bruno Mars and his fascinating story.",
