    "introduction": "A decade before Dr. Strangelove and Fail Safe, Doom Town suggests that the political and defense establishment is fundamentally averse to grappling with the consequences of its brinkmanship. A military spox at Desert Rock Base even spins nuclear war as a boon for the lowly enlisted man: “Don’t let anyone delude you about so-called ‘push button war,’ with its guided missiles and long-range bombers. The role of the foot soldier is more important than ever. Bayonets and hand grenades will still be necessary—to dig out the enemy.” Such prognostications are frequently undercut by the narrator’s faux-hardboiled deadpan-isms (“Leave it to the army and the Atomic Energy Commission to pick nice weather for their atomic picnic”)—and, of course, by Doom Town’s throat-seizing climax, a blast rendered in sickly color. by Kyle Westphal",
