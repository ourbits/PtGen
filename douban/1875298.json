    "introduction": "Feet of Song explores the African rhythms of the talking drum and the guitar. The animated stylised figures move beautifully in time with the music, leaping and stamping to the musical score. The bursts of abstraction within the film are often just a few gliding brush strokes cleverly depicting the human form in movement. With the use of airbrush and watercolour, one can see black shapes move against the orange, ochre and stripes of primary colour and a host of multiplying dance forms.Erica Russell researched extensively for her film in dance, music, African masks, sculpture and body painting.",
