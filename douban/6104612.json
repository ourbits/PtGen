    "introduction": "An elderly blind man weaves bags out of string in his apartment, to the sound of children playing outside; meanwhile, his pussycat is forever unraveling the balls of string he winds, but his hands never cease their work. At some point, the bags are ready, and so the blind man heads out onto the street to give them away – but no passer-by wants one, even though they are free. These are the bare bones that In the Dark comprises, but they prove more than enough to rend your soul to shreds. Occasionally, cinema needs no more than this to reveal great – usually unpleasant and therefore silenced – truths about the human condition. Existence, silence, action (here it is the hands that see, not the eyes), loneliness, and the real stripped of all embellishment, across 42 minutes of relentless veracity. Painful, but precious.源自：https://www.filmfestival.gr/en/section-tdf/movie/1278/14945",
