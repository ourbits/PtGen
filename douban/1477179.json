    "introduction": "Hated is a 1994 documentary directed by Todd Phillips about the life of GG Allin, a punk rock musician who died from a heroin overdose in 1993. Allin was infamous for excessive behavior (drug addiction, alcoholism, physical violence), and his stage shows became confrontational events involving indecent exposure (stripping and performing naked was one of Allin's most common rituals), onstage defecation and coprophagia, physical assault (both on and by Allin), and obscene language.The documentary included concert and rehearsal footage as well as interviews with Allin, fellow bandmembers, friends, detractors and dedicated fans. Later in the film, Allin discusses the earliest years of his childhood in rural New Hampshire, and that his father tried to encourage his family to assist him in a mass suicide. The documentary continues through his rise as a punk musician. Footage of his controversial performances include a violent confrontation with audience members at a spoken word appearance at New York University, as well as scenes of Allin defecating during shows, mutilating himself and assaulting concertgoers at an East Village, New York City rock club .The documentary also contains footage of Allin cavorting at a party (perhaps the most graphic content of the film) and Allin's appearance on Geraldo Rivera's talk show. Footage of his funeral and corpse are also included.",
