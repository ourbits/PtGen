    "introduction": "此节目的形式是以九十年代美国儿童的品味来设计，以上肩和观点镜头，营造亲临现场、即时拍摄的影像风格，并运用大量娱乐性图表、特效、喜剧效果、音乐、三秒钟的短画面、快速率剪辑。此外，在比尔解说现象时，还不时穿插短段式的真实影片或资料片。例如提到没有大气层会让人觉得很热，立刻插入一位胖子拿扇子猛扇的生活影片，以及阅兵典礼中贵宾一直用手帕擦汗的资料画面。节目中固定会将该集主题排成一段MTV式音乐带。片尾，比尔总是出其不意的在冰河上、在恐龙的挖掘地点、在海里，向观众大喊：“这就是科学的力量！！”科学就在比尔德诠释与带动下，成为一件既酷又炫的事。制作人艾伦形容比尔“是一个对科学有狂热的天才”，他游泳、开飞机、高空弹跳、跳降落伞，无所不能也无所不做。他会不断地为孩子解释一个科学概念，直到他们完全了解而且感到兴奋为止。艾伦视这个节目为阖家共赏的节目，她开玩笑地说自己就是节目的目标对象，如果剧本她根本看不懂就得重写。也因此，[比尔教科学]获得全美家长最佳选择奖的肯定，1998年5月，更得到第二十五届艾美奖最佳儿童节目主持人、最佳儿童节目编剧、最佳音效合成、最佳音效制作、最佳摄影五个奖项。比尔笃信的座右铭是：“一次测试胜于一千个专家观点。”他认为最佳的科学装备是显微镜，有了一家显微镜，我们可以看到的世界超乎想象。收看[比尔教科学]，我们同样也会惊奇发现，原来科学世界超乎我们想象的疯狂。During my childhood in the 1990s, \"Bill Nye, the Science Guy\" was one of the many shows I watched on TVO. I enjoyed it at the time, and I think I learned some pretty interesting things. I was also sometimes shown episodes of the show back in grade school, and later, in the early 2000s, I was shown episodes in my high school science classes, some of which I could still remember from years before!The show was hosted by Bill Nye, both a scientist and a comedian! Each episode would focus on a certain scientific subject. Bill would talk to viewers about this subject, using a lot of humour and demonstrations. The show featured many different sequences, all having something to do with the topic of the episode, including comedy clips, along with a music video for a parody of a popular song, with new lyrics to fit the subject. Guests were sometimes featured in the series as well.When I was shown episodes of this show in high school, I found that I didn't enjoy them so much anymore. However, that's just me, I'm certainly not saying that only kids would enjoy it. I'm sure some of the other students in those science classes with me liked the episodes they were shown! For many kids, \"Bill Nye, the Science Guy\" was educational with its science lessons, as well entertaining with its humour! It could also do the same for certain high school students, and maybe others. In conclusion, Bill and the others behind this show deserve a lot of praise!",
