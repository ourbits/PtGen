    "introduction": "Other Lily is written and directed by David Romero;The animated short Other Lily tackles the concept of Sleep Paralysis by combining other disturbing horror tropes: The lone babysitter, the creepy kid with an imaginary friend only she can see, the doppelganger looking to steal your life away, the supernatural invader; they all combine into a story with unusual impact. Another thing that makes Other Lily so impressive is that it accomplishes all of this without any music or dialog, just sound effects.",
