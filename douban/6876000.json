    "introduction": "Art Car: The Movie follows a handful of artists as they prepare for the 2010 Houston Art Car Parade, the largest art car parade in the world. The film explores the automobile's place in American society, and its value as a sense of self, as told through a small but dedicated subset of car enthusiasts who transform their cars in truly outrageous ways. Art Car: The Movie is an in-depth examination of America's quintessential form of outsider art.",
