    "introduction": "Faces 1973并非是James Benning的2011年作品Faces。Faces 1973是一部25分钟短片，这是资料来源：https://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film590774.html。同时，以下为导演对Faces 1973的自述：One of the films I remade was a film that used two faces in it from a short little three-minute film that I made for the Henry Mancini television program back in 1973. The two main characters in that film were a prostitute and a junkie, and because of that, it was never shown on television. So I thought I would rework that film, copied those two faces and took the last two seconds of the film of the two faces and stretched them each to 12 ½ minutes. I made a 25 minute film out of two faces. - JB",
