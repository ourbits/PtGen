    "introduction": "To many, the legacy of King Henry VIII begins and ends with his six wives. But remarkable though his marital history is, it is not what defines him. Just as influential were the men who surrounded him before and during his 37-year reign as King of England. Join host Dr. Tracy Borman as she reveals the story of Britain's most famous monarch and how his male advisors, ministers, family, and friends molded his views, shaped his destiny, suffered his ruthlessness, and, in the end, exploited his vulnerability.S1 E1 The Unexpected KingS1 E2 The Absent KingS1 E3 The Tyrant King",
