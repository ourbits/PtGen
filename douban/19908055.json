    "introduction": "The wisdom of hand and heart comes pouring from the presence of John Cage, caught on video by the eye of Chris Felver. Cage is at Crown Point Press in San Francisco preparing an exhibition of his etchings based on smoke and rock formations. Remembering Black Mountain College he cites the people who made it exciting, Robert Rauschenberg, Charles Olson, Josef Albers, and Buckminster Fuller. Detailing the first \"happening,\" Cage underscores that his music is a more refection of what is outside of himself, not within him. He reminisces about his initial encounter with the I Ching, a text that taught him the importance of chance operations, the grounding of his music, writing and visual art (Neeli Cherkovski)",
