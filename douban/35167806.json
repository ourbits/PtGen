    "introduction": "Built in 1968, Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is the quintessential landmark of Nanjing City. It's been described by propaganda as one of the greatest achievements of the New China and its cliches can be seen everywhere, in school books, on posters and on TV. Recently this symbol of Chinese national honor has become a suicide magnet According to non-exhaustive statistics, in its history of 39 years, there had been over 2000 deaths from the bridge. Between 2003 and 2004, 234 suiciders ended their life jumping off the bridge.",
