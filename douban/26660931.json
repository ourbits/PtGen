    "introduction": "Fox has given a script commitment plus penalty to Remedy, a medical drama from writer Katie Lovejoy (Dracula), Sheldon Turner and Jennifer Klein’s Vendetta Productions and 20th Century Fox TV, where Vendetta is based.Written by Lovejoy, Remedy is an aspirational drama about Remedy Shaw, a young female medical professional with a rare neurological condition that allows her to literally feel her patient’s pain. As she enters the impersonal, evidence-based medical system for the first time, she discovers that her unique ability to empathize with patients allows her to do more than cure sickness; it heals people. And in the process, she may even heal herself.",
