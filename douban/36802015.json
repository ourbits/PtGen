    "introduction": "Brancusi, Les métamorphoses de la sculpture by Alain Fleischer will be the last film shot in the former studio of Brancusi, reconstructed by the Italian architect Renzo Piano. A film that illustrates the sculptor’s attachment to his native country, Romania, and demonstrates the eminent role he played in the invention of contemporary sculpture, renouncing to be Auguste Rodin’s assistant with the now famous words: “Nothing grows in the shadow of great trees”.",
