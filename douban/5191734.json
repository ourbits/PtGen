    "introduction": "A police investigator is violently interrogating a boy accused of subversive activities. Meanwhile, at home, his wife is tending to their gravely ill son. The investigator starts to believe that there is a strange link between the pain he is inflicting upon his prisoner and the recovery of his son.\"Lullaby for a boy\" is excellent. Very nice story told in very cool way. Director is showing us time of post communistic country, where interrogation is done in old fashion way. Bitting prisoners, fear, terror and family affairs - this is a plot of this movie. My favorite scene is this where the main character is going to the basement step by step and camera follows him. One long, lovely shot. Smoth, nice and easy. But step by step. Story is based in Serbia, but actually this thing may happened everywhere. Police,prisoner and torturers. It is Serbia but it might be as well USA and their CIA prisons. Actors are playing very nice. Not to big express and very nice photos. Very good suspense. Very good music. Very good movie. Keep it going Milos",
