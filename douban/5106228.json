    "introduction": "This movie is an Israeli cult film directed by Boaz Davidson which was released in 1986. It is a touching and funny coming-of-age film about thirteen year old Alex, who falls head over heals in love for the first time. Sounds harmless enough on the surface, but this romantic comedy set during the years of Israeli independence is at times pretty racy stuff. There is a twist with the romantic love interest, a seductive older relative from Poland who has mysterious ties to Alex's family. Suddenly his crush on a schoolgirl deflates, eclipsed by the ravishing Lola. Only European films seem to pull off this kind of stunt and turn it into something incredibly charming and, in fact, beautiful.His mom is the classic \"Polish Mother\", his school friends are young hustlers dreaming of nude girls, his schoolmaster is a nervous Russian immigrant. The street speech is full of Polish, Russian, and Farsi slang, full of the small talk that had later entered the everyday speech. The soundtrack, which is quite remarkable, is built solely on the American music of the period. Everyone in the feature finds one's love and happiness. Remarkably, there is not a single hint on politics.",
