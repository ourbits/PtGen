    "introduction": "Armed with a hand camera a young woman plunges straight into her own life, and allows us to share the experience: the first boyfriend and first kisses, the first argument and break-up, the tears shed before she meets somebody new. As one of the YouTube generation so ready to share emotions she captures the whole lot on camera. And the day-to-day life that unfolds is a seismographic register of the self-image cultivated by teenage girls today.The directors Pavel Kostomarov and Aleksandr Rastorguev take the footage from this filmic experiment to produce a fascinating, in-your-face tragi-comedy. And this immediacy is precisely what makes I DON’T LOVE YOU seem a little like direct cinema for the new millennium",
