    "introduction": "Goran Markovic’s film is an artwork for the first time seriously analyzing the life of the citizens of Serbia during the reign of Slobodan Milosevic. It is an examination of a man who was a devoted and consistent opponent of the Milosevic regime, but who nevertheless has a feeling of guilt because of gruesome crimes, an artist who publicly called for responsibility, but who feels responsible, a Serb who is asking for forgiveness for the crimes which, as an individual, he never would have committed and against which he ardently fought for so many years. There is no more dictator. The identity, created by opposing the regime, is lost. Individuals and the society are only left with the painful process of facing “the perpetrators.” Goran Markovic begins with himself, from his family and people from his surroundings. After a number of retrospectives of Goran Markovic’s films at festivals around the entire world, and books about his opus, this film is a retrospective of the last fifteen years of his life.",
