The director, Axel Danielson, have filmed Oskar and Gustav over a ten year period - from nine to nineteen - as they grow up together in an old farmhouse in the country-side, in the very South of Sweden. In 53 scenes in chronological order we follow the brothers through their journey of childhood, adolescence and struggle for identity.",
