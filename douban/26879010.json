    "introduction": "ABC has put in development Grace, a drama project from Mandeville TV with Black List scribes Eyal Podell and Jonathon E. Stewart.Penned by Podell and Stewart, Grace is set in the fictional town of Grace, Missouri. It centers on a family of adult siblings whose lives are upended when their stalwart minister father reveals to his family that he is gay. Grace is described as a serialized drama, a grounded, unfolding saga of a 21st-century American family and the everyday challenges they face as members of a community and as individuals, and how their faith both guides and complicates their lives.The project is inspired by Stewart’s real life. His father was a preacher who came out.",
