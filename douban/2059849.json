    "introduction": "Growing up in France i saw this cartoon when i was around 6. The series revolves around a girl who would meet different characters each show whilst being constantly pursued by a horrendous demon. This demon scared me immensely at the time, but i still loved the show for its overall brilliance. The opening song is pretty good as well. For anyone that likes fairy tales this is a definite must see cartoon. The style of the cartoon's colours as well are very unique and interesting. I always found myself cheering for Clementine as she seemed to be fighting the neverending battle of good and evil. That being said the demon dude was one hardcore looking bad guyhttp://www.coucoucircus.org/da/generique.php?id=83歌声响起来的时候，一切在尽眼前",
