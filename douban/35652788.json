    "introduction": "In 1939 a group of college students made a parody of the classic adventure Beau Geste (1939) on the same desert fort set used by the original. When Paramount Pictures learned of the unauthorized project, they ordered the kids to burn all prints and negatives. This documentary features interviews with the three surviving filmmakers and actors (all now in their 90s), rare photographs taken on the set and footage from the parody itself -- unseen since 1940.—Anonymous",
