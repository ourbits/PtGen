    "introduction": "The Song of the Silly Symphonies is an insightful interview between Leonard Maltin and famous Disney songwriter Richard Sherman; the two discuss the tone and simplicity of the music used and composed for the Symphony shorts. Sherman gives us an impression of Walt Disney's ear for music; though Disney wasn't a musician himself, he knew what kind of emotion he wanted conveyed, and through creative description he would induce inspiration in his composers. Sherman also reveals the key to memorable and popular songs - sincerity, simplicity, and \"singability.\" He, as well as his song-writing brother Robert, almost always implemented these principles into their own work, which included the score for Mary Poppins.",
