    "introduction": "Most people have watched a spy film, but few have ever met someone from the intelligence community. So how close are real spies to the Bournes and the Bonds? Peter Taylor looks at the world of the modern day secret agent.From James Bond to Spooks, from Jason Bourne to Tinker Tailor, spying is big box office business. Its vocabulary has become familiar to us all, from \"stings\" and \"moles\" to \"dead letter drops\" and \"honey traps\".The fact is that the image of such operations as depicted on the big and small screens - and in airport blockbusters too - is firmly rooted in reality. The \"tradecraft\" is common to both the fictional and real world of spying.Peter Taylor was given unprecedented access to serving officers from MI5 and MI6Their names have been changed. They were not allowed to discuss specific operations or policy issues.But those who actually carry out these covert and potentially dangerous operations could not be further removed from their imaginary counterparts, as I found out when I interviewed serving officers from MI5 (the domestic Security Service) and MI6 (the overseas Secret Intelligence Service).",
