    "introduction": "In this three-part story by Uzbekistan director Elyer Ishmukhamedov. Two young men meet two young pretty women at a carnival in this coming-of-age drama. The quartet enjoys the festive atmosphere as they try to forget the horrors of the most recent war. On the brink of adulthood, the characters learn valuable lessons about their lives. Made in 1967, this feature won a Special Award at the International Week Of Asian Film Festival in Frankfort as well as a prize from the Locarno Film Festival.Elyer Ishmukhamedov's 1967 film was deeply influenced by and tuned into the French New Wave and the latest currents in Italian cinema, and there are long stretches in this incandescent film where you might think you're watching a lost Fellini classic. It's summertime in Tashkent, and these three intertwined stories of young love (the first sharing the name of the film itself, the other two named after their heroines, Lena and Mamura) seem to float over the screen like gossamer on a warm breeze. TENDERNESS is filled with unforgettable passages and images, and it's a guarantee you'll go home dreaming of its central image of boys and girls happily lounging in their inner tubes as they float down a river.",
