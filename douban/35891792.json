    "introduction": "Mario Ruspoli has never gotten his due as a uniquely talented documentary filmmaker, inventive in his aesthetic approach to social ills. This is particularly true of these two short films, which Ruspoli made back to back. As he observes the doctors and patients of a psychiatric hospital in central France, Ruspoli preserves the dignity and integrity of the so-called “lunatics”—rare for the time—even as he depicts the sincere thoughtfulness of the doctors trying to heal them through new methods. Michel Braut, the direct cinema documentarian from Quebec, shot the films using a recently developed light 16mm camera that would revolutionize modern cinema. Courtesy Metrograph Pictures",
