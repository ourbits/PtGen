But the life has another surprise in store for her; she gets raped by the bunch of drunks. The estrangement of the man and wife starts from that very same day. Tortured by the sense of self-guilt Khatuna can no longer find a common tongue with her husband. Andro leaves the home, finds out the identity of Khatuna’s attackers and makes them confess their guilt. However they offer money to Andro. Andro pretends that he is about to kill them, but in the last moment throws money at the humiliated attackers and goes back to Khatuna.",
