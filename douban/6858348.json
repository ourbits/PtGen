    "introduction": "His desire for life extinguished by the grief of losing his beloved wife, Edward waits to die. With little money to pay for the proper funeral and burial he wants, he feels he is left with few choices. He fills his days with menial tasks and watching old movies at the local, run down cinema. After he discovers a fellow elderly patron has died in the cinema, prompting the management to pay for the funeral, he begins to devise a plan to end his life in the way he sees fit. Following several unsuccessful attempts, raising the concern of the cinema staff, the man realises that he must allow nature take its course. A touching comedy/drama with real warmth, The End Of The Reel depicts the emotional lengths a lonely old man will go to in order to reconnect with his dead wife.Written by Ailish Bracken",
