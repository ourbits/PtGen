    "introduction": "The town of Ware, MA is like any other small rural town - twenty-somethings with little direction causing trouble, over-sexed housewives seducing their daughter's friends, crazy former crack heads starting religious cults...just a quaint stop off Route 9. Everybody in Ware seems to have a void to fill - they just use different means. Steve Reynolds had been filling his void with drugs, but a vision of God has now inspired him to \"recruit people into the Lord's army.\" His methods for bringing about a spiritual awakening are twofold - either prayer or crossbow(if one doesn't work, the other always does). While on his modern day crusade \"Father\" Reynolds must fight his own obsessive compulsive demons as well as a checkered past, a slew of uncontrollable Disciples and a tendency to relate the Old Testament to Survivor. Will Steve will be able to save the sinners from their sins with a little divine intervention? Only God knows. Written by Anonymous",
