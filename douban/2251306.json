    "introduction": "Peter Brook delivers himself with tenderness to a privileged interlocutor, his son. He speaks about his work and the main times of his career (I am a phenomenon, Costume, Midsummer Night's Dream, Cherry Orchard, The Man Who, Hamlet…). The theater is in the middle of the film, but Brook also evokes his course with cinema, opera, and his love of the voyage... The dialogue between father and son is illustrated with personal anecdotes and family memories. An intimate and radiant portrait.源自：https://www.filmfestival.gr/en/section-tiff/movie/1265/14643",
