    "introduction": "In 1991, Madhu Rye, a well-known Gujarati writer starts reading from the ‘nonsense’ verse he wrote for a play after the communal riots of 1969. Speaking from self-imposed exile, he remembers the home of his language, the city he has left behind. He looks at his ‘Amdavad’ now, the decrepit old town, the crawl of the new consumer culture on the other side of the river, the scooter city, the constantly hungry and overfed city, the city at the end of a decade where it has seen several new riots.A fourteen minute cine-poem, Memories of Milk City catches Ahmedabad at a time of transition, peeling apart layers of textures, gestures and sounds, tripping over a culture and a language at war with themselves.",
