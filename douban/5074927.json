Now they're off to bag themselves a moose, a bear, a fox, a lion, a leopard. It doesn't much matter as long as a fur coat will bag Betty. But neither of them are especially competent at the sport. Koko has to put up with a moose that fires back; while Bimbo suffers the wrath of a lion who multiplies after being shot. And neither hunter accounts for Betty's fickleness or her kind heart.",
