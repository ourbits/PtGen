    "introduction": "This drama tells a story about the daily life of a provincial Lithuanian town in the 1960s. It opens with scenes depicting the preparations for two early summer events: the secondary school graduation party and a traveling theater performance. Gradually, dramas large and small emerge in the life of each of the characters, who are forced to deal with moral and existential conundrums vis-a-vis the Soviet realities. The production of the film coincided with the tail end of Khrushchev’s Thaw, which had brought increased freedom to artists. Vabalas, as a result, managed to portray everyday life in the 1960s in a vividly realistic manner. The monotonous rhythm of life and implicit criticism of the insularity and loneliness of ordinary Lithuanians create an unforgettable portrayal of existence on the periphery of the Soviet Union.",
