    "introduction": "Three friends. One night. No turning back.Julietta, a sheltered 18-year-old student from a wealthy family in Stuttgart heads to Berlin with her boyfriend Jiri, a Berlin medical student. Swept away by the ecstatic masses, they eventually lose sight of each other. Julietta wanders through the crowds trying to find Jiri when she finally collapses from exhaustion and the influence of designer drugs. She is rescued by Max, a DJ, who is fascinated by the beautiful Julietta and, in a surreal state of mind, makes love to her while she is still unconscious.Six weeks later, Julietta discovers that she is pregnant and heads back to Berlin in search of Jiri, but instead runs into Max, who has since become friends with Jiri and once again appears to be Julietta's guardian angel. Determined to ignore the growing attraction between them, she finally finds Jiri, who is shocked at first but then joyfully accepts fatherhood. Max, however, can no longer stand to keep the truth from Julietta and reveals everything. The three lovers are headed for a dramatic confrontation.Christoph Stark was born in 1965 in Esslingen.
