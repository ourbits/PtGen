    "introduction": "Putta and Basu are unlikely friends who live in a small fishing village. While Putta does well in school and loves being out on the water in his boat, Basu struggles in class and has a fear of the ocean. When both boys get into trouble — Basu for forging his mother’s signature and Putta for stealing money from his parents — they decide to try and solve their problems by sailing Putta’s boat out to the nearby island, where legend has it that if you leave something behind for the island spirit Panjurli, your wishes will come true. But when their journey takes an unexpected turn, Putta and Basu quickly learn that they cannot escape their responsibilities as easily as they had thought.",
