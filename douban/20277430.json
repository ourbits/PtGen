    "introduction": "The story is about Donald McGlone, the boy with chocolate fingers (his fingers are made of chocolate). Because he is different, Donald has no friends and other children shun him. He grows up isolated and alone. Later he keeps a low profile working as an elevator operator, wearing gloves to conceal his secret. One day Molly, the girl he secretly adores, is trapped by a huge bear in the office. Donald gets a chance to make his difference become his greatest asset, if he is brave enough to save her. The moral of the story: If you are different, don't worry about what others may think, say or do, just be yourself and your dreams may come true.",
