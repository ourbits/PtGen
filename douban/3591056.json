Starting with the corrup practices of Lord Kira and Yanagi-sawa, the Shogun'sSecretary, which in essence led to the incident of Lord Asano's attacking Kira in thePine Corridor of the Shogun's Palace, this is the definitive version. Asano Takumi nokami was a young lord with high scruples, who refused to join in the generalcorruption and bribery which ran rampant in the capital at that time. By not givingbribes, he angered Kira Kozuke no suke the elder lord in charge of protocol at thePalace. Refusing to teach the younger man, and giving him false instructions wasonly the beginning. Insults followed, and a man of honor had no choice but to drawhis sword in anger. Forty seven masterless samurai are willing to give their lives toavenge their lord. Nothing could match the courage of these warriors as they showthat truly the sword is the soul of the samurai, and the samurai is the soul of Japan.This massive story is told in two parts, with an amazing all-star cast, a must see!",
