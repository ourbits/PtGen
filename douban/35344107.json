    "introduction": "The screenplay, written by Achim and Cosmin Manolache, follows Teo (Bogdan Dumitrache), a director who is immersed in rehearsals for his new feature centring on the personal turmoil he has suffered, caused by the death of his daughter. As the main story unfolds, strange and unsettling frame stories arise, which teeter between fiction and real life. The more the performance tries to disguise real life, the more it is disrupted by life’s unpredictable course, prompting a series of ambiguous, unbearable and absurd events.",
