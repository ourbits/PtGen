Thomas Steiner is regenerated, thanks to his mother, and it seems her goal is for him to lose his homosexuality. He awakens from his regeneration with memories of Kazo, a man he loved. He goes in search of him. But, was Kazo ever real? And what will mother make of this son who leaves the safety of The Circle in search of something else?",
