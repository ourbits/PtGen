    "introduction": "Julie Fabre (Nathalie Delon) is plunged into despair when her son dies on the operating table -- but the depth of her loss is nothing compared to how she feels once she finds out that the doctors were responsible for her son's death, and that one of the doctors was her own husband. He has disappeared, and in spite of harassing his fellow doctors to gain information on his whereabouts, Julie has no luck at all. Just as she seems to have no means of finding her husband to exact the retribution she desires, she meets Gabriel (Patrick Norbert) -- someone still mourning the death of his own brother -- and between the two of them, they start to build a legal case against her spouse. As a part of that process, they steal some damaging medical records and when her husband comes to retrieve them, Julie kills him. Now both she and Gabriel, her accomplice, have to run from the police unless they decide to face prosecution -- not a likely scenario.",
