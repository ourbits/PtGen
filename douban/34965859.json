    "introduction": "Mass media were invaded.Television and radio were interrupted by an invading signal.All Internet connections were dead and the phones mute.Everyone stood in front of the television screens thinking it was only interference but, instead of their usual program, another image flooded the screen: an abstract mass moved hypnotically.At first, no one could specify what they saw, but as their viewgot used to it, they began to see shapes: incredible live illustrations on a live support too. Like the tape of a film, but so slow as to perceive its displacement, always from right to left. It was not mechanical. They moved like something that breathes and walks.A similar image had never been seen.The radio emitted only a distant murmur, like a whisper. Nothing else.",
