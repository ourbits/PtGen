    "introduction": "The year 1985. Oliver, a young boy with an extremely colorful imagination, moves to the southernmost tip of Europe with his family right when Halley’s Comet is due to pass. These events will represent a before and after in Oliver’s emotional life, as he searches in the stars for answers to his problems at his new school, in his new neighborhood and at home. To top things off, his granddad, who’s nickname is “the nut job”, encourages him to interpret the comet’s message and take a step forwards into his new universe.源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/olivers-universe/",
