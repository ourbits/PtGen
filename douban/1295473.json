    "introduction": "The film is about the stories of Ailí, Morón, Equis, Fer and Toro. They live together in Buenos Aires. It shows the intimacy of every day situations combining like a puzzle fragments of the five characters during five days of the week. Each one go through different situations that ends in an unique scene about the desires and limitations of our lives.Sólo por hoy is a well-achieved blend of simple storytelling, realistic and natural acting, good dialogues and attractive cinematography with some camera experimentation. It occurs to me that director Ariel Rotter has influences that range from Eric Rohmer, to Jean-Luc Godard, to 90´s video art and the generation of the music video. Although it shares the timeline of Argentine film history with phenomena in the line of \"Pizza, Birra Faso\", and a certain tendency to work on the issues concerning marginality, it is a different perspective to watch \"Sólo por hoy\" and see a way of film-making that is less of the same and more aesthetically eager. I´d say this film is the transition between the \"90´s argentine neorealism\" I was mentioning before, and films that look up to a more sophisticated visual and actoral challenge.",
