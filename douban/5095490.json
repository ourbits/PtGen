    "introduction": "The fundamental questions of human life about guilt, repentance, and redemption are addressed in this installment of a two-fold documentary essay (together with The Bright and Dark Side of Things), delving into the grief of the women from Sliven Prsion who give birth to their children behind bars. Binka Zhelyazkova anatomizes a deep collective trauma through the unique stories of her heroines. The film wasn't screened in the theaters until 1989, following a series of changes in the country's social milieu.",
