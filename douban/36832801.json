    "introduction": "A playful bet between adolescent sisters turns from a summer diet into extreme starvation. Eisha recounts how her anorexia became entwined with beauty ideals and the glorification of thinness, ultimately becoming catastrophic. Her attempts to tame her body, she now knows, were a form of rebellion—against femininity, her melancholic mother, and the stifling warmth of her Indian home, which offered food instead of addressing her emotional needs. This first-person doc portrays her teenage years with humor and a nostalgic aesthetic, yet beneath its seemingly breezy surface lies a poignant reflection on body image and self-acceptance that remains strikingly relevant.",
