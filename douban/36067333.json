While the names Casper the Friendly Ghost, Richie Rich, Little Audrey, Dick Tracy, The Green Hornet live on, Harvey Comics has been largely forgotten. This film will bring together stories from family members, artists, and historians and celebrities to reveal the untold story of a company that changed comic books and pop culture forever.",
