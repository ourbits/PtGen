    "introduction": "Mickey Mouse grand marshals a parade of 1932 Academy Award nominees. Minnie Mouse leads the marching band and Clarabelle Cow rolls out a carpet for the celebrities. Wallace Beery marches in boxing gloves with Jackie Cooper as his footman. Lynn Fontanne and Alfred Lunt walk the route together. Helen Hayes shuffles down the carpet. Fredric March appears as both Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Marie Dressler follows, trailing a corset and an alarm clock. Pluto brings up the rear of the parade.",
