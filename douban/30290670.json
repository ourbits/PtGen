    "introduction": "What does it mean to be aboriginal today? The film brings us to Pessamit (formerly Betsiamites), an Innu community on the North Shore of the St. Lawrence. One-on-one with the camera, people speak their minds in surprising and revealing ways. Thirteen members of the community talk about their daily life and their identity, heartaches and hopes. Betsiamites is a portrait co loured by their words, a film that forges ties between cultures.",
