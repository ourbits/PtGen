As the investigation proceeds they discover that the dead woman's sister was raped and committed suicide fifteen years earlier and the perpetrator mysteriously disappeared.

During the siege the villager's dark secret is revealed and the reason for the current murder becomes clear and Havers is forced to relive the horror of her recent shooting in order to prevail.",
