With Eve's help Maxine gives life to a magic doll and sets out to solve her current problems, inadvertently releasing Eve's dead GOVERNESS from her astral prison and unleashing a storm of supernatural activity. Her older brother COLIN is gradually drawn into the dangerous situation created by the 'Little King' and must finally face his own mother in a brutal fight to the death. Written by Stephen W.
