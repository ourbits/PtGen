    "introduction": "A full concert filmed in late July and early August of 2007 over five of the 11 sold-out nights at the famed Fillmore Auditorium in San Francisco, CA. Features seven all new tracks not available anywhere else, along with new versions of fan favorites and a selection of Pumpkins rarities. From the opening note to the final chord, the documentary If All Goes Wrong showcases a band returning with an \"enveloping epic force\" (Los Angeles Times) as it traces The Smashing Pumpkins during their 19-show residency, which began with eight shows at Asheville, NC's Orange Peel in late June and continued through 11 sold-out nights at San Francisco's famed Fillmore Auditorium. Interviews with band members, fans, journalists and fellow musicians reveal the fears, excitement, determination, exhaustion and tension inherent in main singer-songwriter and lead guitarist Billy Corgan and his newly revitalized musical unit. The documentary also includes Voices Of The Ghost Children, a featurette about the band's fans, and an interview with The Who's legendary guitarist and songwriter Pete Townshend as bonus material. The band explore the freedom afforded to them in a live setting, including the 30+ minute opus \"Gossamer\". The Fillmore Residency also includes five songs recorded live from the floor of The Fillmore that gives fans an intimate glimpse of the band as a performing entity.",
