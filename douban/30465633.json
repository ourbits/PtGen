Kenny, a young basketball star, is one of the few teens that breaks away from the social constraints by dismissing the peer pressure of joining a gang. Kenny accepts a scholarship to play college basketball at one of the states top universities. However, after a series of unfortunate events, his college career is cut short and Kenny finds himself back at square one. With employment opportunities being very scarce, Kenny finds himself straying down a dangerous path from which he may never return.",
