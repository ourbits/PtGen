    "introduction": "Three stand-up comedians seek fame and fortune in the hottest comedy scene in the world: San Francisco in the 1980s. There they meet rising stars Robin Williams and Dana Carvey. Success, it seems, is just one good stand-up performance away. Soon, Will Durst, Larry 'Bubbles' Brown and Johnny Steele are being courted by agents and studios. We follow them on a 30-year journey that is both hilarious and moving, through comedy's boom and bust, and into their current scramble to survive as artists. 3 Still Standing offers a rare glimpse into the art and business of making people laugh.",
