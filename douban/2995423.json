    "introduction": "影片以宽银幕拍摄，视野比较开阔。导演没有用太多的篇幅表现开幕式，只是简单地纪录了点燃火炬的仪式。之后，影片即开始表现各种赛事。一开始是男子4X100米接力，接着是男子标枪、女子标枪，男子100米跨栏等。声音方面，现场音响加单一的男声解说。.影片较长，原版长度为240分钟（美国发行长度为120分钟）。It catches the spirit of both the year 1968 and the games., 6 September 1999Author: f. baez from Mexico Cityhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064756/The film catches the spirit of 1968. The glance is on the individual against odds and the joy of sport, not -as in previous olympic films and as the mexican government expected- in the \"greatness\", the solemnity of ceremonies or the \"participation\" of the masses. It is also the first olympic film to take a deep look on losers: the scene of the arrival of the last marathonian made a breakthrough on the way we look at sports. Or film them. It could have given a critical view of the events before the games (the massacre in Tlatelolco), but was constrained by its' sponsor: the government. Anyway, in Mexico young guys liked it, but it was abhorred by older folks.",
