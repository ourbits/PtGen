    "introduction": "The innocent brothers are wrongly accused of a crime by a corrupt and violent police officers and are forced to face the injustices of the brazilian penal system. This drama of two brothers falsely accused of robbery and murder is based on an actual incident. The miscarriage of justice begins when an honest man with lots of money disappears from a small village. A police lieutenant decides the crime should be solved and throws bogus charges at the innocent brothers, and they admit to being accessories to the crime after being repeatedly tortured. In spite of no evidence of a body or the missing money, the brothers are jailed, and they begin a horrifying journey through the mazes of the justice system. A heroic lawyer never wavers in his attempt to free the two men.\"The Case of the Naves Brothers\" fills an important gap in the many genres of Brazilian Cinema - the trial movie. The story - based on true events - follows the injustices suffered by two innocent brothers in a small Brazilian town, in which both are tortured for months by corrupt and despicable police officers. While being expertly directed and written, the film is unfortunately dated on a technical level, yet its themes are more contemporary than ever, specially when one considers the constant violations of human rights in Third World countries such as Brazil.Overall a very important, brave and honest film. A remake would be most interesting, specially in view of the rebirth of Brazilian Cinema. A film that not should not be forgotten.",
