    "introduction": "In this striking meditation on the Australian migrant community, a Filipino teenager follows his mother through the bleak landscape of Melbourne’s northern suburbs.Following his distinctive feature debut Anak (MIFF 2022), director Caleb Ribates revisits the theme of disconnected youth with this knockout short – a stylistically dazzling work that confirms the talented young filmmaker as one of Australia’s most promising. Raw and unsentimental, the film evokes the isolation of first- and second-generation migrant communities through the eyes of a Filipino adolescent and his mother, an experience that Ribates portrays through arresting camerawork and tender performances.源自：https://miff.com.au/program/film/walking",
