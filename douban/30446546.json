    "introduction": "Victorian Sensations (w/t) on BBC Four transports us to the thrilling era of the 1890s, a decade of rapid and often bewildering discovery and change which continues to resonate today. In their respective films, mathematician Dr Hannah Fry (pictured above), actor Paul McGann and psychotherapist Philippa Perry explore the technology, art and culture of the last years of Queen Victoria’s reign. They reveal a Britain bewitched by electricity and X-rays; where decadence and artistic genius go hand in hand; and where a mass media revolution encompasses the dawn of cinema and some very Victorian fake news scandals.",
