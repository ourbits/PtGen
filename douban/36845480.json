    "introduction": "A pair of Polish filmmakers travel around Central and Eastern Europe and explore cases of hybrid warfare in this region. They show their investigation and the evidence they managed to produce in Poland, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Moldova and Latvia - the countries of the post-Soviet camp. They do it in a cinematic way, creating a documentary in which they reveal what was supposed to remain hidden.",
