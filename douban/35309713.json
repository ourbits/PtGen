As a Japanese living in China, he realized, not only China has gotten the pandemic under control, its economy is recovering at a rapid speed. Why is China able to achieve this during the post-pandemic era? He began his search by visiting enterprises and industries that have achieved positive economic growth after the pandemic.",
