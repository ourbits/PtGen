    "introduction": "\"Tomorrow I Could Be Dead\" recalls the story of a group of reckless Spanish stuntmen active during the second half of last century. Their vibrating careers firstly introduced them to roman peplum and big budget historical films - Alexander the Great, Spartacus, Ursus, King of Kings, 55 Days in Peking- later on to spaghetti westerns - the Leone Dollar-Trilogy, Django, Keoma - and finally to big international productions during the 70's and 80's such as Conan the Barbarian, The Wind and the Lion, Breakout or Indiana Jones and the last crusade. These men, half brave, half crazy have become part of history of cinema and, thanks to their adventurous condition reveal themselves as extremely interesting characters whose stories still await to be told. Thanks to their commitment, Spanish stuntmen still are sought after for their extraordinary skills on horseback.",
