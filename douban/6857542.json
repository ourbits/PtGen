    "introduction": "New One Tree Hill season 9 photo features happy Brooke reunited with her estranged dad. CW recently dropped a couple,new premiere photos for it’s upcoming “One Tree Hill” 9th and final scene. This particular photo shows a very happy, Brooke David,reuniting with her long lost father,played by actor Richard Burgi.It looks like the first episode will be a little mellow compared to what I’ve heard is supposed to eventually go down. I guess you’ve got to start off a little light with these sort of things. However, once they get into it,we’re going to see crazy Dan Scott return to try and get his murdering thing going again. He’ll be spotted with a gun.Brooke isn’t going to be looking so happy when she’s spotted vandalizing a restaurant. Julian smile will be turned into an instant frown when he gets the everliving crap beat out of him. Haley won’t be smiling,either,after she identifies a dead body. Chase won’t look like such a nice guy when he’s handcuffed,and taken to jail. Oh,and I’m sure there’s more,just you wait and see. This last season is going out with a mega bang,for sure. It kicks off this Wednesday, January 11th at 7pm central time on the CW.",
