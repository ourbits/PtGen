    "introduction": "The Tuckers is a brand new sit-com series (6x30') for BBC One Wales, set in the Welsh valleys, written and starring Steve Speirs.The series follows the fortunes of the Tucker family, a close-knit, extended family of ‘loveable rogues’ who earn their living in a number of ways - many of which are on ‘the wrong side of the law’.Glyn Tucker (Steve Speirs) lives with his mother Peggy (Lynn Hunter) and his two sons Billy (Joshua McCord) and Bobby Tucker (Ben McGregor). The multigenerational family are constantly looking for ways to bring in more money via their ‘legitimate’ catering business whether it’s selling wine or furniture removal.Money is tight, their tempers are short and a brush with the local constabulary is never too far away.The series examines the love/hate relationship between members of the clan, ultimately proving that blood is thicker than water.Woe betide anyone who gets on the wrong side of the Tuckers!The Tuckers is a BBC Studios comedy production for BBC One Wales, directed by Ian Fitzgibbon produced by Owen Bell. The series was commissioned by Paul Forde of BBC Cymru Wales and the Executive Producer is Steve Canny of BBC Studios.",
