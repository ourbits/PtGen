    "introduction": "故事描述一位十九岁的少女萍萍，梦想能到日本的汽车零件公司工作，然而为了生活她必须靠在养猪场和为餐厅洗碗的两份工作糊口。而她的监护人阿姨田夫人，原来暗中经营婴儿买卖，专门安排少妇与外劳交欢，然后将生下的婴儿转卖给无法生育的夫妇，从而赚取利润。原本就和田夫人相处不融洽的萍萍，在得知了这种不法勾当后，心里产生了极大的冲突和挣扎。Ping Ping is 19 and wants to go to Japan to work in a car parts company. She's under the guardian of her aunt, Madame Tien, who shuffles her between two jobs; working in a pig farm, and cleaning dishes in a rundown restaurant. Tien is also involved in a ‘baby factory’ scheme, pairing young women with migrant workers and then selling the babies for money. Both survive with each other in a love-hate symbiotic manner, until a truth about her aunt is revealed to Ping Ping.",
