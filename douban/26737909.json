The water supply is inconsistent and they often find themselves without any water. A couple of drillers - a father and his daughter - arrive, in order to solve the water supply problem. The family's harmonious world shatters into pieces. Everyone loves and hates everyone else. The thirst for love is so great that only death could quench it.",
