She spent the whole life in a most remote rural village and never traveled. For the purpose of being looked after in her old age, she brought up 8 children. However, the gap between urban and rural development has caused the structural poverty in rural areas and drives the children out of the hometown for survival. They backed home once a time only in Chinese new year festival.In 2018, her body began to weaken, and was unable to get down bed. At the request of the mother, her children came back to take care of her until she was finally exhausted. Heat and cold, life and death, are mixed into each other.That is a life of an old Chinese rural lady.",
