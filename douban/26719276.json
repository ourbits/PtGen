    "introduction": "The BAFTA and British Comedy Award winning Hunderby returns with a two part special brimming with the dark and absurd humour that has become Julia Davis’ trademark. Dorothy, the twisted housekeeper of Hunderby, has her sights firmly set on becoming wife to its master and Lady of the Manor. But Brother Edmund’s appetites lay elsewhere, and when he is further encouraged to stray, by the return of the toffee brown Brother Joseph fresh from his tropical travels, Dorothy must invent myriad ways to snare her man. Having been told they are brother and sister, Crippled Hesther and the dashing Doctor Foggerty lead separate but entwined lives: Hesther languishing in a grim hovel within the Hunderby grounds, whilst the Doctor abides in the grand house…close to his beloved Helene. When puritanical Pastor John arrives to tend Edmund’s wayward flock, he means to punish each and every sinner - but not before he has secured a wife.",
