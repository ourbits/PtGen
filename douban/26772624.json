    "introduction": "Rightor Doyle, out actor, writer, and Instagram hero, has created a new web series, The Walker, following his life as a gay best friend to Carey Mulligan, Zoe Kazan and Betty Giplin.“You’re like a gay superhero!” one of his lady pals says to Doyle in the trailer.The eight episode series is an exaggerated version of his real life friendships with the trio of notable actresses, while poking fun at the often unfair expectations culture puts on a GBF.Doyle’s character Walker does it all: He’s a shoulder to cry on as well as an on-hand plus-one when one of the stars needs a date to an event.In one hilarious moment, Walker even agrees to take the fall as the father to one of his pregnant friends (she has no clue who the real one is).Soon enough, Walker’s own star begins to rise, threatening the very balance of his A-List posse.[It’s] fun to play with the idea of making the supporting character in everyone else’s story the protagonist of mine. The Walker is an exploration of how friendships can be the most loving, confounding and rewarding relationships in your life.It is my love letter to women, and to New York, and to friendship in all its many wild and wonderful forms.ASMALLWORLD Gala Dinner For The Alzheimer's Society At Gstaad Palace HotelAside from acting, Doyle is also a contributor to Elle, writing hilarious, compelling pieces about being a professional best friend to celebrities, as well as his beautiful, complex relationship with his best girl friend from college.The Walker also stars Mamie Gummer, Gabourey Sidibe,and Nev Schulman.",
