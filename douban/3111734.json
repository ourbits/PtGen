    "introduction": "\"The Bret Hart Story: The Best There Is The Best There Was The Best There Ever Will Be\", has been released by Silvervision.co.uk and bbfc.co.uk. According to bbfc.co.uk, the documentary part of the DVD is set to run a mind-boggling two hours and 40 minutes, by far the longest feature in a WWE home video release as they're typically one hour or one hour and a half. The other two discs will be matches and extras. The DVD is set to be released on November 15.Also, Bret Hart had a lot of input in this DVD, by far more creative control than anyone else that WWE has made a DVD on. Had he not participated, the DVD would have been called \"Screwed\" and it would have a negative tone akin to the recently released Ultimate Warrior DVD. He personally chose all the matches that will be appearing on the DVD (which explains why his last WWF match isn't on the DVD), so if you feel the DVD is missing something or there is a match you think shouldn't be on the DVD, it's on Bret and not WWE. Letting him choose what matches and content goes on the DVD really helped sway him into participating in the project.He traveled the globe for the better part of two decades, winning the coveted WWE Championship as well as millions of fans. Born into wrestling royalty and fulfilling his destiny with the straight-laced attitude and finely tuned technical ability. Fans identified with his no-nonsense style and many of his peers call him one of the technical wrestlers of all time. A worldwide Superstar, he achieved the ultimate goal in sports-entertainment and suffered unimaginable personal tragedies. The is the Bret Hart story.Hear from Bret Hart himself as he takes you through his early years with Stampede Wrestling, the Hart Foundation, his reign as WWE Champion, internal family feuds, Survivor Series 1997, WCW, the death of his brother, Owen Hart, and much more.Hart Foundation vs. British Bulldogs (Madison Square Garden, 13/07/85)Hart Foundation vs. Killer Bees (Madison Square Garden, 17/02/86)Bret Hart vs. Ricky Streamboat (Boston Garden, 08/03/86)Bret Hart vs. Ted DiBiase (Odessa, TX, 08/03/89)Hart Foundation vs. Rockers (Saturday Night's Main Event, 28/04/90)WWE Tag Team Championship MatchHart Foundation vs. Nasty Boys (Wrestlemania VII, 24/03/91)WWE Intercontinental MatchBret Hart vs. Mr. Perfect (SummerSlam, 26/08/91)Bret Hart vs. Bam Bam Bigelow (Barcelona, Spain, 24/04/93) (Spanish Commentary)King of the Ring Semi-Final MatchBret Hart vs. Mr. Perfect (King of the Ring, 13/06/93)Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart (Wrestlemania X, 20/03/94)WWE Championship MatchBret Hart vs. Owen Hart (White Plains, NY, 29/09/94)Bret Hart vs Hakushi (In Your House, 14/05/95)WWE Championship MatchBret Hart vs. Diesel (Survivor Series, 19/11/95)WWE Championship MatchBret Hart vs. British Bulldog (In Your House, 17/12/95)Submission MatchBret Hart vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin (Wrestlemania 13, 23/03/97)WWE Championship MatchBret Hart vs. Undertaker (One Night Only, 20/09/97)Owen Hart Tribute MatchBret Hart vs. Chris Benoit (WCW Nitro, 04/10/99)Also:~ The Kiwis are interviewed on Stampede Wrestling~ Dean Hart Tribute~ You Start the Fire Music Video~ Bret Hart pays tribute to his colleagues that have passed away~ Bret discusses the origin of the dungeon~ Bret discusses being away from home on Halloween~ Bret on friendships formed in the Hart Foundation~ Bret on the origin of the Sharpshooter~ Bret tell how Owen crank-called Stu Hart~ The Family Tree~ Learning the ropes~ Sunglasses~ Being a Villain~ Real matches",
