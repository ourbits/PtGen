    "introduction": "Zuhal Erdem, a personal development expert at the peak of her career, has achieved success through her consulting on love and relationships as well as her published books. However, despite her persona as a modern, urban and a beautiful woman, she is entirely different in the home that she shares with her father and sisters. At the age of just 17, after losing her mother due to a traumatic event, Zuhal's life was turned upside down. She devoted herself to raising her three sisters and lived the life of her mother, who was in the grave, until she approached her 40s, never straying from the commands, service, or words of her strict and extremely obsessive father, Çetin. She has raised her younger sister Figen, who is just a few years younger than her, Aslı, who is in her 20s, and Begüm, who is still a high school student. The root of her chronic loneliness lies with her father. To compensate for a mistake made in her youth, Zuhal made a promise to Çetin: she would be the mistress of the house and would not let her mother’s absence be felt. After years of loneliness, she meets Tayfun through her assistant, Eylem, and faces great difficulties for the sake of this relationship. She will go against her father Çetin and embark on a journey full of love and disappointments.",
