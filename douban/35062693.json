    "introduction": "Artist Michael Markowsky spent 5 years convincing the Canadian military to let him fly in an F18 fighter jet so he can make sketches of the experience and then use them to inform his studio paintings. We are given an insight into Markowsky's artistic process and how much of the work involved in his painting is so process oriented.",
