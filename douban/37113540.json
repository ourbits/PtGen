When a neighbour residing in the tree hollow decides to throw a redbird party, both birds are puzzled to find they aren’t invited. Determined to win the other birds’ favour they bring them treats and struggle to become the reddest of redbirds, and yet they can’t understand why they’re left out of the festivities.Describing their short film series Two Little Birds, directors Soderguit and Schettini have shared that the characters’ journeys “start anew every time”. They’re always ready to embark on quirky adventures, even if it means risking their feathers or their home tree. In this episode, the loveable birds face the tricky task of making new friends. Will they wing it and succeed?",
