    "introduction": "Cecilia is the only teacher on a small fishing island. Her daughter Maria and her best friend Lucia are two of her pupils. One morning Maria is excited about the return of her fisherman father and asks Lucia to cover for her as she goes to watch the boats come in. Cecilia takes some time to realize that her daughter is missing. She runs to the beach to discover Maria has drowned. On the day of the funeral Cecilia has still not come to terms with the death and the crushing guilt she feels. She tries to mother the impoverished Lucia and takes her to the now empty school, instead of preparing for the funeral.",
