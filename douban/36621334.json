    "introduction": "This documentary looks back on the career of one of the most ambitious and unique artists of our time, Iraqi-born architect, Zaha Hadid. Working in a field generally dominated by men, she was the first woman ever to win the Pritzker Architecture Prize. Hadid pioneered a form of parametric design which utilizes computer software to enable the creation of designs with unprecedented plasticity. Among her best known works are the London Aquatic Centre, the Guangzhou Opera House in China and the Heydar Aliyev Center of Baku in Azerbaijan which was selected as “Design of the Year” in 2014. Her work has always resulted in structures that are incredibly forward-thinking and very memorable.",
