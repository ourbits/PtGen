    "introduction": "最早的一部关于苏拉姆城堡传说的电影，此片启发了后来帕拉加诺夫拍摄那部更为著名的彩色版《苏拉姆城堡传说》。Durmishkhani, an illegitimate child of a serf woman was brutally taken away from his mother. Lately he meets Vardua, a young maidservant. They fall in love and want to marry. Vardua helps him to go to a business trip to make some money. Durmishkhani meets a rich merchant Osman Aga. After some time Durmishkhani marries other girl and becomes Osman Aga's heir. Vardua gets to know this all and decides to take revenge.Ivan Perestiani was born in the city of Taganrog into the family of Nikolay Afanasievich Perestiani on April 13, 1870. His first actor's experience was onstage of Taganrog Theatre under name of Ivan Nevedomov in 1886. The first movie roles played by Perestiani were Grif starogo bortsa aka Griffon of an Old Warrior and Zhizn za zhizn aka A Life for a Life in 1916. During Russian Civil War, he wrote scenario for several short films.In 1920 Ivan Perestiani moved to Tbilissi, becoming one of the founding fathers of Georgian cinematography. In 1921, he staged the first Soviet Georgian historical and revolutionary film Arsen Jorjiashvili aka The Murder of General Gryaznov, where he also played the role of Vorontsov-Dashkov. The silent black and white movie Tsiteli eshmakunebi (Russian title Krasnye dyavolyata (Little Red Devils)) that he staged in 1923 basing on the novel by Pavel Blyakhin is considered as one of his best film director's works.Perestiani worked several year at Odessa Cinema Studio, Armenfilm studio, and finally returned to Tbilissi in 1939. For his achievements he was awarded with three orders and the honorary title of People's Artist of the Georgian SSR in 1949. He died in Moscow on May 14, 1959.",
