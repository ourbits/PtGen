    "introduction": "Trying to outrun anxiety, seeking joy and strength in landscape and movement. \"Ten Degrees of Strange\" is a music video based on a song by Robert Macfarlane and Johnny Flynn, from the album Lost in the Cedar Wood, directed and animated by Lynn Tomlinson. Taking inspiration from The Epic of Gilgamesh, an ancient story written on clay tablets, and responding to the strangeness of the global pandemic, this story of loss and hope in nature is told through colorful, shifting, changing, morphing clay on glass animation.",
