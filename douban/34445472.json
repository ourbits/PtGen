    "introduction": "Three college students, Ryan, Jake, and Erica, set out to film a great horror movie for one of their class projects; but during filming, something goes terribly wrong and the students suddenly find themselves in their own worst nightmare. Some of the events are caught on tape by the camera that Jake continues to record with, a camera that is later retrieved by two detectives, Adams and Dalton. It's now a race against time, and the detectives must use the video to rescue the students. As the case goes deeper, the detectives eventually find themselves in the middle of a dense forest on the outskirts of town, and what they uncover is far worse than what they could have ever imagined",
