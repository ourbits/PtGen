    "introduction": "12-year old Kircho is anxious about rumors of the apocalypses. He looks for the answer to the tormented questions from his mother, a teacher of biology, an astronomer, a priest and finally ends up in hospital, and he seeks answers from the doctor and the psychiatrist. Instead of the expected treatment, these conversations only serve to exacerbate Kircho's fears and make them intolerable. And then at the most difficult moment, he is alone and suddenly realizes the glorious truth that to live means to be needed by someone. \"The meaning of life\" is a fable of the Little Prince of Bulgarian decadence, resolved to unravel the secret of the Apocalypse and prevent it. The film is surprising in its tenderness, sustainable even despite its superfluous off-screen pathos and catastrophic visions. This tenderness is so generous that it models atmosphere, behavior and message.",
