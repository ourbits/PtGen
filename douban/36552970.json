    "introduction": "A concert pianist picks up a stray cat from the street and makes it his pet, pleased that he has found a docile companion. However, the cat soon starts misbehaving. As his bad behavior keeps elevating, even his looks seem to be changing. The pianist´s attempts to discipline the cat fail miserably. The situation becomes rather violent, driving the pianist to the very edge. The film is an allegorical story about internal conflict, a confrontation of destructive and creative beginnings in a person as shown through the characters of the musician and the cat, its owner’s alter ego.",
