    "introduction": "Is \"The Man\" controlling the vertical, the horizontal and the channel you'll be on? In a privatized American Internet, is big business \"Big Brother\" or does the free market protect and serve the needs of the average citizen with its invisible hand? With the simple act of swapping files, barbershop quartet baritone Robb Topolski finds himself at ground zero of a landmark case whose outcome will affect the rights of every American citizen. Following one man's personal quest to defend what he believes to be his inalienable rights, BARBERSHOP PUNK examines the critical issues surrounding the future of the American Internet and what it takes to challenge the status quo. Contemplating the future of the American Internet and the inalienable rights under review.",
