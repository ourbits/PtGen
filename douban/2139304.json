Head characters are Domino Dominka, Zlatka Kopecná, Edison, plant female workers and flirtatious woodsmen with their wives.Plot makers are woodsmen and forester, who seeks what they cannot have - love, loving & young beautiful women. Thus boys are about to go out for love-making. A comedy about three flirtatious woodcutters realistically capturing Slovak village life and criticizing insincerity, hypocrisy and male pride.Surely they'd better think this twice, should they foretold what shall happen. Fortunatly, the situation goes so, we can spend a couple of minutes laughing on well made gags and paradox situations.Aside main characters, the film is decorated by some minor. Brigade-worker, female cooks, girls in Diamant bar and mailman with others shall keep you in a good cheer. Reprise playing of film will not lower the experience. As for the large-scale of action and count of actors and their individual knots (eg. Jasterciak became dumb after hiding in the bowling wall).The Infidelity in Slovak way consists of 3 parts - chaptersChapter I - Infidelity, tells story about female workers arrival to work in a woods. Men - woodsmen as well as forester scents a chance for a flirt. So is it, that main plot begins, with many of comic situations, parodies and good laugh...",
