    "introduction": "If you are a GWTW fan, this movie is a pleasant surprise, 16 February 2005Author: slanskye from United StatesNot knowing much about Margaret Mitchell except how she died, but knowing GWTW inside and out from reading it at least 5 times, this movie was a treat. I can't say how accurate it is - i.e. how much of this movie is based on fact and how much is \"interpreted\", but it is interesting to see where some of the characters in GWTW might have come from. And I didn't even know who the actress was that played MM until I came to see the stats on it here - imagine my surprise to see it was Shannon Doherty. I thought she did an excellent job - the Southern accent was decent too. Well, I guess I must like this movie because I'm in that over 45 grouping - and not biased against Ms. Doherty.PLOT DESCRIPTIONThis made-for-television movie tells the story of Margaret Mitchell, the well-known author of Gone With The Wind. Young TV-star-turned-Hollywood-bad-girl Shannon Doherty stars as Pulitzer Prize-winner Mitchell, whose impulses and insecurity inspired her passionate work. John Clark Gable, son of legendary Gone With The Wind star Clark Gable, is also featured in this biopic, which was generally panned by critics for Doherty's portrayal of Mitchell. ~ Bernadette McCallion, All Movie Guide",
