    "introduction": "Sena Quina takes a lighthearted look at Bolivian regional stereotypes. It features an easy going layabout from the wine valleys of Tarija who travels to the capital La Paz looking to buy a piece of modern equipment that would boost his fiancée's business and convince her to marry him. But once there he falls in with two crooks, one a Paceño and the other a Camba from the eastern region of Santa Cruz. Along with a smooth female accomplice they cheat him of his dreams, but he is determined to have his revenge and accompanies them to Santa Cruz where he plans to sabotage their swindles. It's a charming film whose characters and comedy transcend boundaries, as well as being a laid-back, extended play on Bolivian stereotypes.",
