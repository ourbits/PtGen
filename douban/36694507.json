    "introduction": "The story of Lukas and his godmother Perinbaba is interwoven with adventure, humour and magic spells. After the death of his parents, Alzbetka and Jakub, their son Lukas embarks on a long journey in search of happiness. Thanks to his ingenuity, youthful fearlessness and skill, he finds a way not to get lost in the world. He is helped in this by his four-legged friend \"Ucho\", who joins him on the journey. The knowledge that Luke gains during his journey will eventually help him win the love he has dreamed of and find a place where his surreal dream will become a reality. Miracles don't just happen in dreams, they happen in life. And if we truly long for something, it can come true. And how will the endless battle between the two immortal sisters Perinbaba and Toothless turn out? Who knows, all we can reveal is that seven is a lucky number",
