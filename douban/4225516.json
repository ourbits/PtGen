    "introduction": "Rave Un2 the Year 2000 is a 2000 direct to video film of Prince in concert. Although taped earlier in December, 1999, the concert was o riginally broadcast via Pay-per-view on New Year's Eve, 1999. The concert features several notable cover versions, and some Prince's biggest hits. Special guests included former band associates, Rosie Gaines and Morris Day, funk legends Maceo Parker and members of The Family Stone, as well as funk-rock performer, Lenny Kravitz. The concert is notable for \"retiring\" Prince's classic hit, \"1999\" (although it would be reintroduced to his performances in subsequent years).Track List:Let's Go CrazyShe's Always in My HairU Got the LookKissJungle Love (Morris Day and the Time)The Bird (Morris Day and the Time)American Woman (Lenny Kravitz)Fly Away (Lenny Kravitz)Gett OffMedley (Rosie Gaines, Mike Scott, Maceo Parker)It's Alright[disambiguation needed]Everyday People (Cynthia Robinson, Jerry Martini)HigherPurple RainThe Christ (retitled version of The Cross)Blues Medley (Maceo Parker, Johnny Blackshire)Nothing Compares 2 UTake Me with U/Raspberry Beret(with Mr. Happy instrumental coda)The Greatest Romance Ever SoldBaby Knows1999 sample introBaby I'm a Star1999",
