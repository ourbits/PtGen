As her life ebbs away, Scarlett struggles with her faith and God's love for her. How could a loving God cut short her life and plans? Chase helps her overcome her fears and doubts as they fight the battle together. Living next door to them is a young woman named Mia who is fighting for her life and the life of her unborn child. After leaving a mental institution where she was dropped as a child, Mia fell prey to an abusive marriage. Now she has nowhere to go and no one to help. She thinks. When Chase hears the sounds of domestic violence coming from next door, he intervenes to bring help and Mia discovers that God has heard her prayers. With a surprise twist at the end, the three lives of Scarlett, Chase and Mia intertwine and bring hope to the hopeless, peace to the battle, and beauty for ashes.",
