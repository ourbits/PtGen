    "introduction": "The Rufa'is belong to a dervish order—a Muslim religious mystic group, with a long history in this region. The film was filmed in the building of the Rufa'i tekke in Skopje, at the türbe, and some other spaces (for the guest and the prayer room). The emphasis is on the ritual, prayers and dance accompanied by music instruments (tambourine, kudüm, zill-cymbal) and with thinner and larger daggers (t'k and darp) and other activities typical only for the Rufa'is.The film was made in 1951 and is an excellent example for the visual protection and preservation of intangible cultural heritage, especially because its content was rarely covered and treated in ethnographic films.",
