    "introduction": "The Lonely follows the life of Cody Hyatt (played by director Jay Burleson), a depressed twenty-something who moves into a new apartment with hopes of starting over after a painful breakup. Already on edge, Cody develops a series of unhealthy obsessions that gradually cause his life to spiral out of control. While fixated on his ex-partner, Cody channels his obsession to a new love interest, the former tenant of his new apartment. Yet an even darker obsession begins to develop---a morbid fascination with the assassinations of two American icons-- President John F. Kennedy and his brother, Robert Kennedy.",
