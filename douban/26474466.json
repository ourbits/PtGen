    "introduction": "National Dream is a film about Mexico and the World Soccer Cup. The documentary s dramatic recounting of soccer history is like a time machine that goes from 1928 to 2012. Throughout the illustrative, fast-paced, action-packed journey, viewers get to actually feel the energy of a packed-to-the-gills Stadium and experience the thrills of the most exciting games. They relive Mexico s euphoria when it hosted the Cup in 1970 and again in 1986, the nail-biting and held breath during a penalty shoot-out and all the action of the world s most popular sport.",
