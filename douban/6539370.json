    "introduction": "Based on a story by Marietta Shaginyan. A circus is travelling the roads of the civil war. The actors perform for the Reds and for the Whites alike. Then the circus is requisitioned and the performers are now subordinate to a Red Army political department. Thus the side-show becomes a propaganda carriage and the young tight-rope walkers Serzh and Masha will sort out the political situation, conscientiously join the Red Army and take part in the battle against Denikin.",
