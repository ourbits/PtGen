    "introduction": "The film follows the migration strewn with pitfalls of Chinese crabs, imported from China by accident at the beginning of the 20th century, which are born in the North Sea, go up the rivers of Flanders to grow there for a few years, and return to the sea to reproduce and die. The director uses a big range of forms and approaches, including slapstick, to build these crabs’ lives into an existential metaphor, which expands the method she already mastered in the previous film Dans le regard d’un bête. A modern poetic parable, between reality and fiction, open to the fragmentary diversity of reality.",
