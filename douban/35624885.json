They came from right here on earth, and it all started with a nefarious organization called ROAM. Catering to the extremely wealthy and privileged, ROAM Corporation offers a very elite service. They can place you into another body,. ROAM harvests the bodies of young adults, homeless kids that won't be missed, but soon, their operation will branch out and everyone will be at risk. The only one that can stop them is a young woman named November. Once a victim of their operation, she plans to destroy the technology, before it destroys humanity.",
