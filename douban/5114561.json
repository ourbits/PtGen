    "introduction": "Released in 1990, this Swedish film production is probably a nearly forgotten piece of coming-of-age art.  The story is simple enough, and is about a ten-year-old boy living with only his father in a house in the countryside in the southern part of Sweden.  The boy's father is a mechanic and also runs the local gas station.  The boy is however more interested in nature and wild animals than in technical stuff, which makes a gap in their relationship.  One evening when he is wandering alone in the forest, he finds a wounded bird.  He then decides to rescue the bird and together with his best friend they build a temporary cage for the bird in a hidden place in the forest.  They promise not to tell anyone of this place.  The rest of the film deals with the boy's rescue mission of the bird and his relationship with his father.",
