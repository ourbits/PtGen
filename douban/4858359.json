    "introduction": "A man with disfigured arms (and a pet chimpanzee) wanders across the countryside, eventually intruding on a man with--well, I'm not quite sure what the second guy is suffering from. We're supposed to think he has no legs, but he clearly has them folded together--so perhaps he's actually paralyzed below the waist and something got lost in translation. At any rate, the two immediately engage in a battle, with the Thalidomide victim performing some impressive stunts with his feet and a knife whilst his wacky chimp companion somehow manages to bring the bout to a close by destroying a barn. Simple as that, our two crippled heroes now become crippled best buds. Shortly afterwards, they rescue a beautiful young blind woman on the run from local gangsters, and the stage is set for a throwdown against an evil warlord. This film was so successful it spawned a sequel, Crippled Masters, and it's easy to see why--the disability angle makes the film's underdogs all the easier to root for and the cast are engaging. Ocean Shores' pan and scan video print (titled Two Crippled Heroes) is watchable and in passable condition.",
