Hebba is the hostess of much appreciated TV programs about female victims, e.g. daughters who are buried alive because of improper behaviour, people drowning when attempting illegal immigration to Europe. Karim is told that he will only be appointed if his wife avoids political topics. He does persuade her to make programs on ordinary people instead. But her \"non-political\" programs will become even more repugnant to the authorities",
