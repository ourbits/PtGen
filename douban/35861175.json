    "introduction": "Women whose families were killed in Croatian war for independence; who were tortured and raped but survived kept silent for 25 years. The slowness of the justice system, the agonizing process of fact-finding in legal proceedings, the inadequate government support and eventual stuffing with tranquilizers–pushed these women to the edge of their physical and mental strength, ruined their marriages, led them to internal isolation and illness.Despite all that and the fact that they still live in the vicinity to their abusers-former friends and schoolmates, these women are getting their power back.Determined to change their lives to better, they've turned to new healing methods, focused on the solution, not the cause.  For 3 years the film follows 3 women connecting with their deepest truths.The change of perspective of significant events from their history takes place in group and individually.They are discovering there's a healthy part in all of them that is BIGGER THAN TRAUMA",
