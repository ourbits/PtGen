    "introduction": "Hotel Aporia (2019) is a video installation that features multiple rooms, each replete with video projections, shoji screens and tatami mats, simulating the interiors of a Japanese-style inn. The work features a cast of historical figures from Japan’s interwar period including World War Two kamikaze pilots, philosophers of the Kyoto School, filmmaker Yasujiro Ozu, and animator Ryuichi Yokoyama all of whom were caught up in the heady mix of Japan’s militant nationalism, anti-modernism and cultural propaganda. Letters and correspondence between the artist and his Japanese collaborators, the writers Tomoyuki Arai and Yoko Nose, form the narrative basis of Hotel Aporia, while the installation draws on the aesthetics of Japanese architecture and Ozu’s cinematography. As the audience moves through the various rooms, contradictions between the beliefs and actions of the aforementioned characters come to the surface, so much so that it becomes impossible to agree upon the “Japan” that is referred to and idealised by some of these characters.",
