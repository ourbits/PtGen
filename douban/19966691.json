    "introduction": "On July 27, 1986, Queen performed the largest-ever stadium concert at the Népstadion in Budapest in front of 80,000 ecstatic fans. The concert was part of the famed Magic Tour, which was the last time the band toured with lead singer Freddie Mercury. Now, this original concert film has been remastered in high definition and features many of Queen's favorite tracks—\"Bohemian Rhapsody,\" \"Crazy Little Thing Called Love,\" \"I Want To Break Free\" and \"We Are The Champions.\" In addition, this special cinema event is introduced by a documentary feature that gives the inside track on events leading up to the Budapest concert. With three years to go before the fall of the Berlin Wall, this was the first Western rock concert performed in a stadium behind the then Iron Curtain. It was of such significance to the Hungarian authorities and film industry that a group of the country's top film cameramen and technicians were brought together to film it for posterity. Using archive footage from rehearsals, interviews with the band and on the road during the Magic Tour—some of which has never been seen before—this fascinating intro feature has been specially created for cinema release.",
