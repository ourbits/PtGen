    "introduction": "It’s 1945 and Hitler is dead. The remaining Nazi leadership is expected to surrender any day but not all Nazis are in agreement. When the guards of the castle turned POW prison, Castle Itter, flee their post, a group of French political prisoners are forced to defend themselves. Rumors of a rogue Nazi captain hellbent on maintaining the Third Reich threaten the lives of all the prisoners at Castle Itter. With the help of members of the German resistance, a small band of American soldiers, and one Sherman tank, Castle Itter makes its final stand in the final hour of WW2.",
