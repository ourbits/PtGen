    "introduction": "新西班牙电影早期经典之一，柏林电影节银熊奖。Surprising and intelligent spanish movie. The main character of \"El anacoreta\" is a man (wonderful Fernan Gómez) who has decided to live in his bathroom and not going outside never (well, the bathroom is pretty big). The movie follows this special man in his routine life and specially when he writes messages to anonymous addressees, putting them in bottles and throwing them by the WC. One of these messages arrives to \"destiny\" as one girl from Italia picks one bottle from the sea and comes to visit the man. The movie has two special points of interest: 1) its amazing originality and 2) its wonderful portrait of a man loneliness. \"El anacoreta\" is one of the best spanish movies of the 70s.",
