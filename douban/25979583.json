But that doesn't stop them to search for love and sex. They meet in Paris daily in dimly dance clubs where they express their desire for living a full life in togetherness through dancing. And if prince charming is reluctant to appear the well-heeled ladies spent some money for lessons with 'taxi boy' Michel. Michel dances with them for money - and behaves like a real gentleman. In search of love both - men and women - overcome nearly every obstacle, even if in many cases it doesn't bring them closer to their aim.",
