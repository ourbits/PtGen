    "introduction": "Imagine nine, peach-fuzzed young teasers in a milk and cookies spoof of the world's most famous all male dance troupe! Aaron, Simon, Sid, Kyle and their pals will gyrate their way into your heart and make you chuckle aloud at their puppyish exuberance and camaraderie. Watch the guys at rehearsal and later on stage, as they reveal some of their most exotic costumes and dance routines to an enthusiastic audience of female bubblegummers. Then meet these charming pre-teen dreamboys up close and personal, as they discuss their lives and passions, and then get wild in a spirited game of shirts and skins soccer Written by Jim Stark",
