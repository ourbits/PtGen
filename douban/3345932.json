Monica is the daughter of the British ambassador in Greece, and cannot speak the Greek language, but Loizos and his gang know their share of English. Alekos is a 15-year-old romantic, passionate, and highly impulsive. Loizos is calmer and meditative, but also aggressive when pushed by circumstances. Monica is a melodramatic socialite, who develops feelings towards Loizos, even if Alekos has fallen for her. When Loizos' best friend, Andreas, is killed, their lives are turned upside down",
