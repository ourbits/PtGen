    "introduction": "Host Patrick Macnee (who should be knighted by now but that's another forum) provides a clear, concise history of Leonardo Da Vinci, the famous artist created the Last Supper and Mona Lisa. In this documentary which was probably inspired by the craze regarding Dan Brown's book about the Da Vinci Code, the documentary goes into detail about how the ideas formed from the Knights Templars to the Gnostic Gospels which were priceless in itself. For those of us who are interested in biblical scholar, this documentary is quite effective without being so overwrought with details and information. The experts are quite excellent in explaining the information about the theories and the life of the time.",
