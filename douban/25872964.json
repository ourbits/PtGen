    "introduction": "Leo Nikolaevich, Levanka, Levochka, as numerous friends call him, is a successful glamorous Moscow photographer. He is smart and amiable. And he is a totally cynical person capable of being rude with people. He belongs to the world, where talent, success and fame are valued above all. Although unaware of that, he is very immature at the same time. He is still obsessed with childish fears.“Metel” (”Snowstorm”) is a movie about unconscious desire to escape to childhood, especially in danger or difficult moments, when decisions are to be taken. ”Metel” (”Snowstorm”) is a road movie both in form and in matter, a chance to look at one’s self and get insight into the self. It is nostalgia for the past, the Golden Age, tradition, culture.",
