    "introduction": "The film begins in 1938. The main storyline focuses on the fateful love between Frantisek, a young lawyer and athlete, and Michelle, a dancer, who meet at the post-war European Basketball Championships in Geneva. Michelle has suffered a hard life, having escaped from her home because of Stalin and Hitler. Their story, which, in addition to politics, is affected by two contrary individuals-trainer Valentor and functionary Hrabal-culminates in 1951 when Europe has already been divided by the Iron Curtain for several years. In spring 1946, the then Czecho-Slovak basketball representatives were more famous than soccer or hockey players, because of their sensational return from Geneva as European champions. They begin dreaming about how to match the Americans and to defend their title against the Soviet Union. The fiercest competitor is, however, waiting for them at home and the greatest obstacles off court. The story is based on real events and the memories of the survivors.",
