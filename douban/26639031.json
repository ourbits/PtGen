The series will look at how centuries of religion, history and politics have shaped life there and still affect people today.Across the series Simon will uncover a place of myths and spirituality, alongside a modern state still attempting to work out its identity and values: a multicultural place where communities no longer just define themselves along Protestant and Catholic lines.",
