    "introduction": "What are labor movement leaders of the 1980s and ’90s doing today, 20 years later? This film begins with the daily lives of four middle-aged Korea Telecom laborer “ajussis.” They “live,” hanging off of utility poles, making repairs below manholes, eating lonely meals of soup and rice, making sales, and getting on the red-eye train once a week to see their families. They are within us and among our neighbors, quietly living day by day. But the moment they start talking, what they do becomes more than just “living.” That’s because they have all dreamed of a world for laborers, fighting against Korea Telecom’s unfair layoff program, in the past, present and future. Sanda is not a grand narrative about the history of labor movements. Neither is it a behind-thescenes documentary contrasting the past and present to make us reminisce over history. It simply portrays today’s labor scene by talking with individuals living, or surviving, today. As we listen on, we come to reconstruct our own experiences. (HONG Hyosook)",
