    "introduction": "This film is a short adaptation of Plato's, 'Allegory of the Cave' animated in clay. An excerpt from Plato's Republic, the 'Allegory of the Cave' is a classic commentary on the human condition. It is a story showing how true reality is not always what it seems to be on the surface. It is a story of open-mindedness and the power of possibility. We have adapted and brought it to life by shooting thousands of high-resolution photographs of John Grigsby's wonderful clay animation.",
