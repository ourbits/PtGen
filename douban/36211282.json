Toasting with a special whiskey from a cask whose provenance is a mysterious shipwreck in the Artic, all seems normal to the heirs. But they ignore what comes next, especially the daughter who suffers from a rare decease. And who is the Hyperborean? A film coming from a Canadian director Jesse Thomas Cook whose previous features “Monster Brawl” and “Cult Hero” were screened in Fantasporto.
