    "introduction": "It's suspect to call The Drifter(2009,Taylor Steele)a surf movie,it's more about pro-surfer Rob Machado's personal experiences,than surfing itself.We fallow Rob in a travel to Indonesia,seeking for inner peace,answers and of course surfing.Tired of his public life,Rob decides to disappear and live like a homeless,just camping on desert spots and surfing on non crowded beaches.The movie describes really good the relationship between man and nature,Rob narrates his feelings and discoveries,and see himself more and more into the wild life,totally isolated from civilization,just surfing and writing.The surfing scenes won't disappoint the surfers viewers, beautiful scenes were shots,while Machado shows awesome performances in nice tube riding sessions.With a little bit of George Greenough's 'Crystal Voyager' inspiration, The Drifter seems like 'Into The Wild mixed with surfing.A little masterpiece,sometimes melancholic,with lovely light comedy scenes,and first class soul surfing. Deserves to be on the same league of 'Endless Summer and Riding Giants, and can be appreciated by not only Rob or Surf fans.",
