    "introduction": "The Kalash people of northern Pakistan's Chitral valley uphold a rich cultural heritage that is at odds with Pakistan's dominant Islam. Today, even as the community bears the combined pressures of poverty, tourism, and Islamism, a dedicated group of Kalash advocates are fighting to keep their culture alive. Can Kalash traditions withstand the challenges brought by globalization on the one hand and by religious tensions on the other? Director Iara Lee's new short film, The Kalasha and the Crescent, brings together members of the Kalash community and observers from around the world as they reckon with these tough questions.",
