    "introduction": "Tel Aviv, 2020. A second COVID lockdown is impending. After writing yet another article against Prime Minister Netanyahu, the journalist’s mobile is flooded with hateful messages. Meanwhile, he tries in vain to get to his autistic son at a hostel, while his parents, sick of the lockdowns and of each other, are looking to him for help. Later on his daughter, who is at an anti-Netanyahu protest turned violent, won’t pick up her phone, sending him and his wife on a drive to Jerusalem to look for her. On the way, they are forced to face their relationship issues. Late that night, his family is finally reunited and he finds some consolation while his beloved country is in turmoil. The protests against Netanyahu and his corrupt government are yet again beginning to gain momentum.",
