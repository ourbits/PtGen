    "introduction": "Surrealism in Barcelona! \"Dante no es únicamente severo\" (\"Dante is not only rigorous\") is the manifesto film of \"La escuela de Barcelona\" (\"Barcelona's Film School\"). There is no plot, the movie is just one story after another that a woman is telling to her lover, like a modern Sherezade. There's experiments with the light, the colors, the sound forwards and backwards. Stories of a time that never comes, of princes in blue, of loneliness and desire,... Extremely funny, but beware don't even try to get a meaning of this movie, just watch it and enjoy it as much as you can I could watch it during the 41th Gijón International Film Festival, as part of a retrospective about the cinema movement which was known as \"Spanish New Cinema\".",
