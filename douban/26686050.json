    "introduction": "The Curve is a tiny film which addresses big emotions – a road trip across Jordan in a VW camper van where the displaced occupants speak hauntingly of places they will never reach again. There are moments which single this out as a directorial debut of note, and Rifqi Adnan Assaf’s own screenplay is very special.  He isn’t always sure of his feet onscreen, however, and even at 81 minutes, The Curve experiences some bumpy terrain, but this is a lyrical start to Assaf’s career on features after three impressive shorts.",
