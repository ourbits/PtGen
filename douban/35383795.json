    "introduction": "'Los Espabilados' tells the story of Mickey L'Angelo, Guada, Yeray, Lucas and Samuel, a group of extraordinary young people who escape from a psychiatric center in search of their place in the world. Despite their clinical diagnoses, these boys face life with humor and courage because inside they are clear that it is society that is sick and not them. The boys will go on a journey through Europe to find the brother of one of them, while they are facing their daily medical conditions. In this series we will enjoy their adventures, their search for acceptance while making the most of their lives. This group of friends suffers from mental illness, but above all they are clever boys and they will show it in each episode when they have to overcome obstacles in this adventure of life. The series exudes positivity and humor, while addressing the taboos around the universe of children and the rejection that mental illness causes. A series full of tenderness and humor, the Espinosa world trademark.",
