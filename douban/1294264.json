    "introduction": "Triple murders are rare enough in Sweden that they qualify as headline-grabbing national news for prolonged periods of time. This movie is based on the story behind one such incident, which took place in 1988. A girl and a boy from Finland have traveled to Denmark, where they support themselves by various mildly nefarious means, generally small burglaries. The boy is captured for one of these crimes and does some jail time, while the girl tries to make a go of it on her own. However, when her aggressive young lover gets out of jail, she takes off with him to Sweden. There, they engage in ever-more daring criminal feats, until one day they murder a married couple and their teenaged son while they are visiting a cemetery. According to reviewers, there is a sense of inevitability in the progress of the story, which focuses on the alienation and isolation of these two congenital outsiders.",
