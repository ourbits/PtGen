Years later, that girl has become a beautiful woman, Amparo, in love with the member of the resistance. But \"El Andarín\" is already someone condemned to be a loser. Hided deep in the forest, he has become a harassed beast. Juan, brother of Amparo, returns after several years of exile to convince him to leave the mountain and to get safely away from there. But Juan ignores the relations that his sister has maintained with \"El Andarín\".",
