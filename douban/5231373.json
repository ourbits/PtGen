Carlos finally decides to be a married man and marry Camila since he thinks that people marry everyday and thus everything will work out fine. He goes out of his way to gets a job to support his new family but does not realize the seriousness of his decisions until he discovers that his new boss (Luis Felipe Tovar) is having an affair with his secretary, Lucy (Anaís Belén), and Monica, his new attractive co-worker (Ninel Conde) is attempting to seduce him. To complicate things even more, Camila's father does not approve of the decision that she and Carlos made. The dilemma is that Carlos struggles to defend himself against his father-in-law and from peer-pressure to be unfaithful to his wife...Written by Ghezlanie06 (Ghezlanie Abancio)",
