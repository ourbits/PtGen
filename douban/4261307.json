    "introduction": "Celebrated novelist Daisy Lowendahl (Bergen) has just killed off a wildly popular character in a best-selling series of books and, after suffering a hushed-up nervous breakdown, plans to confront one of her fears by spending a night alone - without her devoted husband, Robbie (Michael Murphy) - at their remote beach house in Long Island. When she arrives there, things don't feel right and she is completely taken aback when she finds Spencer Weaver (Hall) inside the house claiming to be a local young fan whose knowledge of Daisy's life is touching, comprehensive and eerily disturbing. Next to arrive is police detective Eddie Bruno (Brown), who heard from her husband that she was alone and might need protection. Daisy's immobilizing anxiety and escalating sense of dread creates increasing jeopardy for her. Isolated as she is in the fog-shrouded house, her husband is the only other person who knows where she is and can save her, if and only if she can find a way to reach him in time...",
