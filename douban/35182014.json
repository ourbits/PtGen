    "introduction": "Chania, Greece 2016. A family like any other. A boy like any other. Or maybe not? Little Pavlis lives in his very own world - a world of music, colors and emotions. His parents, Eleni and Yiannis, think of him as a genius. But the arrival of Eleni's younger brother Vasilis and his wife Ioanna will unsettle their everyday life. Ioanna insists on something being different about the boy. Pavlos, the grandfather, is the only one who dares a reality check and then everything is turned upside-down. The family is confronted with the truth: autism. Communication problems surface and the struggle to understand and accept begins. All family members are challenged by the new circumstances that force them to redefine happiness and love. How strong do you need to be to accept that your life is not going to be the same anymore? And how can this change lead to more open roads? The series is based on the Israeli series \"The A Word\" by Keshet International.",
