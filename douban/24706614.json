    "introduction": "A lyrical examination of indie songstress Rosie Thomas' quest for an expression of truth, combining songs of plaintive melancholy with sharp-witted banter and Sheila, her bizarre stand-up alter ego. Using intimate live performances with fellow songwriters Sufjan Stevens and Denison Witmer as a pathway, Mars is a meditative exploration of Thomas' unique brand of performance. Written by Found Pictures",
