    "introduction": "这是一部追踪在亚洲最著名的红灯区——歌舞伎町，从事拉客职业20余年的中国人――李小牧参选日本东京新宿区区议员的纪录片。“拉客人”、“如果当选将成为第一个在日从政的华人”，这些字眼从他为了获得参选资格而申请日本国籍开始就成为他最大的卖点，同时也成为他被政敌和保守的日本国民所攻击和怀疑的根本原因。本片通过纪录选举的全过程，表现在日华人从政的艰辛和日本社会对中国崛起的真实看法。This human-driven documentary focuses on Komaki Lee, a Chinese-born pimp who runs for councilor at the Shinjuku City Assembly in Japan. Lee gained notoriety by guiding foreign visitors to sex clubs and other shady haunts in Kabukicho, the most famous red-light district in the country. He's motives are to realize his father's political dream, which was destroyed during China's Cultural Revolution, and to improve the social status of Chinese people in Japan and nightlife workers who suffer from discrimination.",
