    "introduction": "\"A metal band in the 80's and a Mad Max-like near future intermingle in an eye-opening \"New Macbeth\"! In the year 2206, after innumerable slayings and destructions, a heath littered with dead bodies and rubble was left. Three eerie witches manifest themselves in front of an invincible General Randomstar that ESP Kingdom is proud of. They leave a prophecy saying, \"All of your future is scripted in this compact disc\". It was a CD made by a heavy metal band named \"Metal Macbeth\" whose prime was in the 80s\".",
