    "introduction": "On a rented lot in Coney Island, Eddie Miranda proudly operates a carnival contraption called the Zipper. When the property is sold, Eddie becomes the casualty of a power struggle between an opportunistic developer and the City of New York over the future of the famous amusement park. A story about politics, greed, land use and public policy, ZIPPER chronicles a critical period in Coney Island's history and examines the impact of economic development on an American icon. In a market-driven world where growth often trumps preservation, Eddie and his Zipper may be just the beginning of what is lost.",
