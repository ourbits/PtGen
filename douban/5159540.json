    "introduction": "罗马尼亚导演Mircea Daneliuc在七八十年代非常受批评家们的青睐，然而近年来他渐渐被人遗忘。然而这部最新电影却出人意料的成功。它透彻地分析了东欧的艰苦生活和矛盾冲突，背景环境是一个生产电视机的世界。(文：life_is_good@YDY)Although much loved in the Seventies and Eighties by the European critics who counted, the Romanian director Mircea Daneliuc has been somewhat forgotten. Whether for the providential appearance of new directorial techniques, as practiced by Mangiu and Tudur Giurgiu, or for poor distribution, his recent films are little known. Yet \"Sistemul Nervos\" is a surprising film in that it succeeds in analysing effectively the conflicts, the contradictions and the difficulty of living in Eastern Europe through a story which is set in the world of television production.",
