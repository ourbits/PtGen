    "introduction": "Magda and Arek create a harmonious marriage with 25 years of experience, caring for their sick grandfather. They live with their son, Tomek, who is in a long-term relationship with his girlfriend Asia. Seemingly everything is fine - typical family. And yet - Magda, a teacher in a Catholic high school, hides the fact that she prefers women, Arek has not been able to find a job for a long time, and Tomek - a popular YouTuber, is mainly driven by his interests. The embarrassment begins when Magda, tired of living in hiding, decides to follow her heart, setting off an avalanche of new events. Asia breaks up with Tomek, grandpa disappears, and Arek has a problem with re-gluing reality. When crises, conflicts and desires, which have been suppressed for years, finally explode, everyone begins to live on their own. Or at least he thinks so - Will each of the heroes find their own way to be happy?",
