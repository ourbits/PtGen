    "introduction": "这是一部关于恐龙的科教记录片,北极：7千万年前。一个极端的世界。夏季的阳光变成了24小時严寒的夜晚。恐龙们不得不做出选择，勇敢的向南迁徙以寻找阳光。一段充满了暴风雪，火山爆发和致命狩猎者的危险旅程，一个年轻的埃德蒙頓龙开始了他的第一个千里迁移.片中令人惊叹的CG动画 和精心构建的数码世界，可以說是真正的恐龙电影演变,令人震撼.The Arctic: 70 million years ago. It is a world of extremes. Tropical summers of 24hr sunlight are replaced by freezing winters of continuous night. The remarkable dinosaurs that lived under the Northern Lights had to make a choice, brave the winter or head south to find the sun.Join Scar, a young Edmontosaurus embarking on his first thousand-mile migration. It is a journey for survival that is fraught with danger; blizzards, volcanic eruptions and deadly predators lie ahead. Meanwhile Patch, a juvenile Troodon, left alone in the North, must learn to survive in one of the harshest environments the Earth has ever known.This epic feature-length adventure portrays an incredible polar odyssey that actually happened but has neverbeen witnessed before. Based on recent fossil evidence blasted out of the ice around the North Pole, the makersof ''Walking with Dinosaurs'' and ''Prehistoric Park'' are delighted to introduce you to an all-new cast of dinosaurs, from feathered tyrannosaurs to giant marine predators. Featuring stunning animation and a painstakingly recreated digital world, it can truly be said that the dinosaur film has evolved.",
