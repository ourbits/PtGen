    "introduction": "Atypical and rarely screened, Warhol’s first narrative feature is less rigorous, more playful than his later features. In a rare excursion beyond Warhol’s New York base, this home-movie-ish lark features underground icon Taylor Mead (in a literally and figuratively cheeky performance) as an unlikely Tarzan, wandering around Los Angeles in search of his Jane, played by buxom-and-ready-to-show-it avant-garde filmmaker Naomi Levine. Dennis Hopper, Claes Oldenburg, and Brooke Hayward also pop up. The film is considered Warhol’s commentary on Hollywood, then in the doldrums, but, as Warhol said, “This made Hollywood more exciting to me, the idea that it was so vacant.”",
