    "introduction": "Among the ruins of an ancient convent, a small monastic order lives in solitude, relying only on its own forces. Here two novices, Beatrice and Agata, find solace from the rigidity that surrounds them by joining each other's loneliness and consoling one another. When Beatrice leaves the convent, attracted by the chance of living a different life, Agata's hopes for a correspondence with her friend seem to be fruitless. The shy and kind Agata will have to understand how to accept her position in that world, learning what being loved really means.",
