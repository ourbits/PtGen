    "introduction": "The seasonal changes of the Luangwa Valley are extraordinarily intense. Heavy rains transform the Luangwa River from a shallow channel into a majestic waterway where grass grows tall and streams fill with an abundant selection of creatures, providing plentiful food for many grazing mouths. It is a wetland paradise. But it is short lived. A relentless and crippling drought follows and lasts for a majority of the year; weakening all life, save for the predators who take advantage of this widespread fall. This is the Valley of Flood and Fire.S1, Ep3: Dying for RainS1, Ep2: After the RainsS1, Ep1: The Emerald Season",
