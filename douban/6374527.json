    "introduction": "Thirty years after a zombie outbreak, people have got used to living alongside them. Zombies are a cheap source of labour; they also make it possible for everyone else to enjoy a comfortable standard of living. However, the ‘normal’ people first have to tame the zombies by catching them and subjecting them to bloody lobotomy experiments. This is how Katrin and Mark are getting by. They follow their hard day’s work with a beer at night with friends. Their relationship is already on the verge of falling apart, when Mark brings someone home.Written by berlinale.de",
