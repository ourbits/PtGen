    "introduction": "Basically, most Yōkai are peace-loving, harmless demons who rarely interfere with the human world, but do serve them well from time to time. OniKiri, however, are the fiends among the Yōkai, and they are currently wreaking havoc in Japan by plaguing the common people.

For to her, there is nothing more delicious than the lumpy essence of theoni.",
