    "introduction": "Hans Globke was a government lawyer in the Third Reich Ministry of the Interior and co-author of the official commentary on the Nuremberg Race Laws of 1935. In 1953, he was appointed Director of the West German Federal Chancellory by Konrad Adenauer and in 1963 he was sentenced to life imprisonment in absentia in East Germany.The biographical film highlights the fascist threat posed by the reintegration of former Nazi officials into the West German government. Documents from the West German and Western European press are used as evidence in order to expose the fascist nature of Globke's so-called \"shadow cabinet\" of government ministers.",
