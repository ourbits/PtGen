    "introduction": "A playwright goes to Gdansk to have a look at the rehearsals of a work he has written. Unable to find a room in a hotel, he ends up in a private house inhabited by a mother and a pretty daughter. The playwright becomes briefly involved in their lives and their problems and has a fleeting romance with the daughter before preemptorily slipping out as fast as he entered. (Written by Polish Cinema Database)Playwrighting is not a particularly lucrative profession, so the playwright in this movie must stay with a hospitable family when he visits a city in which his play is being shown. The family consists of a sparring mother and daughter. Even the ever-aloof writer is drawn into their genteel squabbles, and he also has a brief romance with the daughter. However, he wisely returns to his hometown, leaving the two to their ceaseless struggle. (Written by Clark Fountain)",
