Andrew is a 29 year old Chinese American who, for most of his life, has never questioned his place or his purpose, unintentionally becoming a \"model minority\". But for the first time, due to some new influences and experiences, Andrew is discovering the effects of his invisibility on the canvas of diversity and is finally realizing he wants to do something about it.",
