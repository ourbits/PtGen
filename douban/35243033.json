    "introduction": "The jazzy “Ducks, an Urban Legend” is a dark comedy which probably gives a believable picture of a Tel Aviv that the audience does not know. And ducks are not just in the title – the film refers to these yellow rubber bath birds both directly and indirectly.All five main characters of this intertwined story ‒ Yossi, Chris, Asaf, Anna and Elias ‒ are facing traumas that have left a mark upon the life of each of them. Yossi and Chris are a contradictory couple of lovers who attempt to love each other despite everything, believing that nothing will break the big feeling. Anna and Asaf, a couple who are in financial difficulties and therefore at an emotional dead end, suddenly find out that Asaf’s grandfather’s death promises to bring them unexpected financial gain. The fifth main character, lonely Palestinian Elias who is waiting for a new heart, is forced to cooperate with the Israeli secret police. His compromised heart has been broken by a beautiful woman he has secretly seen through a window.All these simple people fighting for their life are experiencing the feeling called love. For some, it may be a road to damnation, but for others, loving is redemption.",
