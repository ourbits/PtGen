    "introduction": "弗洛拉在一家商店工作；她遇到一个男孩，寻求少年爱情的常态。她的母亲玛丽亚嫁给了一个虐待她的丈夫；她对自己的过去有一个秘密，她只能和一群女性知己谈论。每当她们外出工作或在市场上偶遇时，这些妇女都会分享她们在印尼士兵手中遭受性暴力的痛苦经历。结合强奸幸存者的真实记录，备忘录记述了印尼军队入侵东帝汶的影响。Flora works in a shop; she meets a boy and seeks the normality of teenage love. Her mother Maria is married to an abusive husband; she harbours a secret about her past that she can only talk about with a group of women confidantes. Whenever they are out working the land or happen to meet at the market, these women share their traumatic experiences of sexual violence suffered at the hands of Indonesian soldiers. Integrating the real accounts of rape survivors, Memoria recounts the effects of the Indonesian army’s invasion of East Timor.",
