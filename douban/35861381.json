    "introduction": "A man dreams about a snake and doesn't leave his house that day. A woman dreams about a bag of money and wakes up empty-handed.What connection do dreams have and the reality from which they arise?Talking about dreams quickly lead to insights into complex relationships, fears and desires.  The film \"Day like Night\" does not only refer to personal stories but also to political contexts:In a country where LGBTQ free zones exsists, a student says she and her classmate share the same dream. A little later, she adds that it is her girlfriend.Telling a dream is too personal for a man; instead, he talks about the feeling of being trapped, similar to a dog on a leash that is too tight. He describes his failed attempt to leave Poland as a teenager and discribes a fate that many people in Poland share.",
