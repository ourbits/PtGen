In a last-ditch attempt to save the lodge, dad organizes a high-stakes fishing derby. Powerless to help until she finds a legendary musky lurking in the waters around the lodge, Juliana devises a plan to capture it and save the business. But when Juliana seeks the help of an old Ojibway guide, she learns this is an ancient 'medicine fish' with a spirit-essence crucial to the survival of the lake, and all other muskies. Will she capture the mythic beast and save the lodge, or will she allow it to live? Written by Torrie, Jeremy",
