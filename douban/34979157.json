    "introduction": "\"Queer Genius\" is a cinematic exploration of four visionary queer artists breaking down barriers in their creative fields as they confront fame, failure, censorship, family, gender, and sexuality. The film embraces the communal possibilities of \"genius\" from a particularly queer perspective crossing genre and generational perspective. The film features intertwined portraits of Eileen Myles, Barbara Hammer, Jibz Cameron, and Black Quantum Futurism. Written by Catherine Pancake",
