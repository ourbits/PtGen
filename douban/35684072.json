    "introduction": "Yashar is a 55-year-old unemployed roofer living with his wife Nisa in a remote Azerbaijan village, spending evenings watching meaningless TV shows. One day Nisa finds him a roofing job, and to assist him Yashar hires his brother's son, Valeh, whom he hasn't seen in years and who happens to be in dire need of money. Both start working very hard but Yashar struggles getting paid by the house owner. Pressure rises on Yashar who committed to paying his nephew. One evening, during an argument, Yashar loses control and beats Valeh, who will never show up again. The second half of the film takes Yashar on a long journey, where alone and relentlessly he looks for Valeh, from the cities of Barda, to Imishli, Agdash, Goychay, crossing car cemeteries, deserted landscapes, encountering dubious characters, helpful ones, all reflecting the hidden and vivid realities of the country.",
