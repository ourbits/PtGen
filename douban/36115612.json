    "introduction": "Elsa, 17, hasn't really started living her adolescence yet when she discovers that everything may already be over: she has leukaemia and needs a bone marrow transplant immediately. The only possible donor? Someone whose name she doesn't even know, even less where he is: her father. Accompanying her on the journey in search of the man is Edo, a boy from the hospital, outgoing and irreverent. There doesn't seem to be anything that Elsa and Edo have in common except the same disease, from which he has now almost recovered. Or at least that's what he told her.源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/supernova/",
