    "introduction": "Not long after the Cecil Hotel in Los Angeles opened in 1924, a guest committed suicide in one of its rooms, beginning a decades-long string of murders, suicides or otherwise unexplained deaths on the property. Is it a mere coincidence or is there an underlying force that ties together the spooky, sinister incidents? That's the question examined in this investigative docuseries, which plays out like a true-crime story with a supernatural bent. It delves into three unexplained events, including perhaps the most compelling, that of Canadian college student Elisa Lam, who suspiciously drowned in the hotel's water tank in 2013.",
