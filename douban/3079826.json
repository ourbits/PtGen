    "introduction": "墨西哥女导演Dana Rotberg最近的一部作品。。。7年了也该出来活动活动了吧，不知怎的销声匿迹了。Acclaimed Mexican filmmaker Dana Rotberg returns to the screen following an eight year absence with this hypnotic drama about love and revenge. Set in a small village during the beginning of the 20th century, Otilia (Gabriela Canudas) is both blessed with a body that is the epitome of feminine perfection and cursed by an ugly mole that mars her beautiful face. The juxtaposition between fabulous beauty and disfigurement proves unsettling for the villagers and she grows up friendless, save the family's hired hand Melquíades. Though most figured she would end up as a prostitute, she is married off to Isidro, the local police chief. Cruel and petty, this ogre of a man brutalizes her and eventually infects her with venereal disease, rendering her sterile. With the help of Melquíades, Otilia takes a series of lovers to spite her husband. One day, the wounded Ruben -- a wanted outlaw -- staggers onto her doorstep and immediately she is in love. Much to Melquíades' chagrin, she harbors and tends to the criminal as her husband is out hunting for him. This film was screened at the 2001 Toronto Film Festival.",
