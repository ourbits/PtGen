    "introduction": "Krzysztof Komeda was a jazz pianist and film composer. With compositions like the lullaby for Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby, Komeda succeeded in writing his own chapter in the history of soundtracks. This documentary follows the life story of the composer by the means of his melodic compositions. It is a reflection on his soundtracks, which changed the common film scores forever. It is a contemporary documentary about the attitude towards life in a time of social, political and cultural change after war, and about the attitudes towards work and the exodus of Polish artists in the '50s and '60s.",
