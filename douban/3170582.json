    "introduction": "近两年反映波多黎各当代女性生活的影片中拍得较好的一部，波多黎各女导演索妮亚的新作。And you think life is tough...Why was this movie overlooked during Oscar time beats me....The story, the acting, everything about this movie is excellent. I seriously hope that this movie gets more attention because it truly deserves it. I actually forgot that I was watching a movie and honestly believed that the actresses were actually suffering from breast cancer. That is how pure and realistic their portrayal of cancer victims was. Did I cry? Of course I did! I cried with them,laughed with them and learned a lot, a lot from them and with them. Please, if you know anyone who has ever suffered from cancer you must watch this movie. Even if you don't know anyone you will not regret the incredible experience of watching this masterpiece.",
