    "introduction": "Mississippi River Styx follows Kelly Phillips, a middle-aged man allegedly suffering from terminal cancer, as he floats 2,000 miles down the Mississippi River in an old house boat. Kelly and his little pug, Sapphire, pinball through America’s heartland making friends, cheating death and living off the charity of river communities. Along the way Kelly’s story takes on a life of its own and by the time he makes it to Southern Louisiana he is a minor celebrity. But over time, people begin to question why a dying man isn’t dying. At the end of the river the conflict between Kelly’s embellished, inspirational persona and his true motivations come to a head and things go off the rails.",
