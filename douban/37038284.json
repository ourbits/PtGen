Produced by Janie Hendrix, George Scott and John McDermott and directed by McDermott, the film features exclusive interviews with Steve Winwood, Experience bassist Billy Cox, and original Electric Lady staff members who helped Hendrix realize his dream. The documentary includes never-before-seen footage and photos as well as track breakdowns of Hendrix classics such as \"Freedom\", \"Angel\" and \"Dolly Dagger\" by recording engineer Eddie Kramer.",
