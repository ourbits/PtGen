    "introduction": "In 1924, documentary film pioneers Robert and Frances Flaherty and family traveled to the Samoan island of Savaii to record the native life and make a film that would try to match the success of Nanook of the North. Fifty years later in 1975, the Flahertys' daughter Monica ventured back to Savai’i, with documentarian Richard Leacock, to record a new audio track comprised of the sounds of the island and voices in the regional dialect -completed in 1980 and released as Moana with Sound. This edition of Moana with Sound, restored in 2K digital by Bruce Posner and Sami van Ingen (great-grandson of the Flahertys), marks the first time Monica's soundtrack has been married to a pristine 35mm print of ‘Moana’ and allows the landmark motion picture to be seen - and heard - in its full glory as a beautiful work of docufiction and an important piece of film history.",
