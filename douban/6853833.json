    "introduction": "Beaten up, bruised, and scared, a young writer hides in a Stockholm apartment, writing the story of its disappeared inhabitants: the flamboyant and charismatic Morgan brothers.It all began a year earlier, when he was rooming with Henry Morgan, a boxer, piano player, composer, bartender, and old-fashioned gentleman with a Gatsby-like capacity for turning life into a feast and absolutely no talent for keeping secrets.The two friends led the high-life in Stockholm until the day Henry’s younger brother Leo – a star poet, drunk, political provocateur – showed up. Leo drags them into a scandal involving illegal weapons and gangsters, and soon the three men find themselves unwittingly and irreversibly trapped in a dangerous plot.Written with an intense regard for storytelling and style, Klas Östergren’s Gentlemen is one of the most important literary works to emerge from Sweden in the past thirty years.Part love story, part international thriller Gentlemen simultaneously celebrates and mourns the post-WWII era with its jazz music, poetry, hidden treasures, and espionage. It now comes to life on the big screen based on a script by Klas Östergren himself and directed by Mikael Marcimain.Gentlemen & Gangsters is a co-production between SVT and St Paul Film, with support from SFI, and will have its premiere in the autumn of 2013.",
