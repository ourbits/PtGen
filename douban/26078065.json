    "introduction": "Jillian's Travels is a one-hour TV special and series pilot filmed in spectacular native 3D that brings children and families on the journey of a lifetime. Viewers will take a trip into the heart of Africa, and become immersed in a spectacular world where wild animals seem so close you can touch them. Our guides on this adventure are sixth grader Jillian Palmer and her 10-year-old brother, Jack. When their parents invite them on a week long African safari, Jillian gets the assignment from her school principal to record a video diary for her classmates at North Hills Junior High School, sharing everything she is seeing and learning about. The bubbly and outgoing Jillian proves to be a fun and colorful host. She enlists the help of Jack, her bookish younger brother, to add lots of fascinating facts he has learned",
