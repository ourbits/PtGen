    "introduction": "Driven by an inexplicable impulse, high school graduates Eglė and Tomas run away from a formal museum tour. They are kindly accepted by a stud farm guard and even allowed to ride the horses. Regrettably, Tomas is met by his aunt’s old fashioned sermons at home, and a ‘D’ in chemistry at school. The friendship between Eglė and Tomas develops further until the girl starts attending drawing lessons given by a professional artist. Tomas’ imagination makes him suffer the torments of jealousy. He decides to talk to the imaginary rival ‘man to man’, but only gets drunk and his neighbour Gina, a pantomime actress, takes him home to hide him from his aunt. Whether the characters learn their first lessons of life, remains unclear. When they meet again, Eglė makes her first step towards reconciliation, showing her feminine wisdom.",
