    "introduction": "Magnus gets no jobs, drinks too much and his financial situation is beyond hopeless. Because of his lack of self-awareness he continues his egocentric and shallow way of life as a commercial director - until his feckless father dies of over drinking in southern Spain. The past is finally catching up when his overbearing little brother Emil wants Magnus to come along to Spain to pick up the body of their late father. Magnus parted with the family a long time ago but decides to go anyway, because he secretly wants the father's vintage Rolex watch, which is worth a small fortune. When in Spain, the transportation of the body turns out to be way too expensive, so Magnus decides in desperation to solve it the cheapest way possible - \"we goddamn drive him our self!\". On the trip through southern Europe with a dead father in a roof box on a tiny SmartCar Magnus is forced to deal with his brother and the family he turned his back on.",
