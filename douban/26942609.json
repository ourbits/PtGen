    "introduction": "This is the story of Solo, a lonely African wild dog that has befriended a number of jackals and hyenas in the Okavango Delta. Solo has helped the jackals raise their pups as if they were her own. So strong is her desire for her own offspring that Solo kidnaps the young pups, preventing their parents from getting near. The pups love Solo: she feeds, grooms and protects them. But when a pack of wild dogs appears, Solo must make a choice—stay with her adopted family or join her own kind.",
