When Robert's daughter announces that she's engaged, he advises her against it - his own marriage to Emily (Lea Thompson) didn't last, and he doesn't understand why anyone would want to give up their independence. Yet when Robert and Emily reunite and dredge up old memories and hurts, both discover they have a lot of unresolved issues and that love, marriage and divorce aren't quite as simple as they'd like.",
