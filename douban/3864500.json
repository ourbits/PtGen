    "introduction": "The Last Desperate Hours benefits immensely from two great leading performances; chiefly Antonio Sabato in the lead role. Sabato fits his character like a glove and comes across excellently as the detestable sleazebag at the centre of the film. He gets great backup from Pier Paolo Capponi as the lead cop on the case. The atmosphere created by Giorgio Stegani is just great and he manages to create an impression of Milan that is as downtrodden and corrupt as the lead character. The film features the Spaghetti style that most genre fans will appreciate - the score by Gianni Marchetti is truly memorable. The plot flows quickly throughout and none of the ninety minute running time is wasted. The director ensures that we always know the central figure is on a deadline and he keeps things interesting by keeping up the cat and mouse game between cop and criminal, as well as implementing a good few murder scenes - one involving a medical saw is a particular highlight! It all boils down to a surprising, yet fitting ending and overall this crime flick is one of the best Eurocrime entries that I've seen and is well worth the trouble of tracking down!",
