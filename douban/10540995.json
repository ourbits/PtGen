    "introduction": "Sasha is a young Russian violinist on a scholarship to Juilliard, living with his affectionate but overbearing father, a cellist determined to manage his son's career. While Sasha prepares for a critical recital that will launch him on a path to a glittering future, he is increasingly drawn to the rhythms he hears on the streets of New York. When he meets Ramona, a bohemian singer/songwriter, he joins her band, and falls in love with her and her music. He begins to lead a double life, careening frantically between two worlds.",
