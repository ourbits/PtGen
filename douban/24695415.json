    "introduction": "12 years ago during a scientific expedition 3 animal biologists stumbled upon a great discovery that ended in tragedy. Whatever killed them has awoken and now the legend of the Ancient Snow Beast could prove to be more than just a legend.Dive into Snow Shark, the outrageous and spine-tingling tale of the world's greatest predator, frozen for thousands of years, freed by an earthquake, and really, really hungry! In 1999, a team of animal biologists investigating a rash of wildlife killings disappeared in the lonely woods near a small town. Years later, a local resident claims to have killed a prehistoric carnivorous creature living in the snow. Now, someone - or something - is making lunch of the locals.",
