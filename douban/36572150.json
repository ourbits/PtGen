The heartwarming episodes capture the love and chaos at the RSPCA Hospital in Brisbane where the team performs life-saving treatment on animals like koalas, kangaroos, wallabies, lizards and possums. Season 2 includes even more stories about the volunteer carers who help nurse wildlife back to good health and until they’re strong enough to return to the wild.Produced by [WildBear Entertainment](https://www.wildbear.tv/work/wildlife-er/)",
