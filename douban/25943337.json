Out of the blue, Mark and Gary find themselves with $250K to headline the opening night of a massive international festival. It's Rocky meets SuperBad set against the hilarious backdrop of two straight guys doing their best to write a musical about an issue they know nothing about - Gay Marriage. As the clock ticks down to opening night and the whole production inches towards collapsing, Mark and Gary ultimately are illuminated to the significance of gay marriage and the potential their musical has to make a change... but is it too little too late?",
