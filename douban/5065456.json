    "introduction": "Robby and Billy, reporter and photographer respectively, are sent on assignment to a South American island to cover a revolution-cum-nationalisation of the oil industry. While there, Robby falls in love with exotic cabaret singer of the Cuba Cabana, Arabella, played by Zarah Leander, after speaking to her at a bullfight and later watching her perform. He meets her briefly, then has to leave to cover the nationalisation with Billy. They are caught by the authorities, but Robby escapes, seeking help from Arabella, who gives it. Unfortunately, Arabella is well known to the Governor as his former lover and he suspects that she might have hidden Billy as he saw them speaking at the Corrida.A game of hide and seek follows, with Arabella pitted against the Governor, who pretends that Robby killed a man at the oilfields and offers a reward to catch the \"murderer\". Does true love win in the end? Watch the film - there's a very unusual twist at the end, just when you'd think everything will turn out well.",
