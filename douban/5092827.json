    "introduction": "Sir Bernard's Stately Homes was a series of British TV comedy series first shown in 1998 on BBC Two and later re-run on Play UK. Only six 10 minute programmes were produced, all written by and starring Matt Lucas and David Walliams. It bore many similarities to the more well-known Rock Profile. The series was directed by Edgar Wright, one of the creative minds behind Asylum, Spaced, Shaun of the Dead, and Hot Fuzz, and produced by Myfanwy Moore, who would become the producer of Little Britain.The central character was Bernard Chumley, played by Matt Lucas, who was already a regular stand-up character of Lucas's and would go on to be a fixture of Little Britain. The show was transmitted from 12 May to 16 June 1998, on BBC2, Wednesdays at 10.20 p.m. In each edition, Sir Bernard and murderer/friend Anthony Rogers would investigate a number of country estates while searching for the Golden Potato, an advertising stunt which would win them a year's supply of Allen's Crisps (\"the cheaper crisp!\").Episode 1 – Baxter Grange, home of Lord Horatio NelsonEpisode 2 – Browning Abbey, home of the archbishop of MexfordEpisode 3 – Yates Castle, former home of the ChumleysEpisode 4 – Bronson House, country retreat of Princess AnneEpisode 5 – Kendall Park, now attached to the country's largest theme parkEpisode 6 – Stebson Towers, the new home of Sir Elton JohnEach house is named after a character or actor from Grange Hill. Further popular culture is revisited at the end of episode 5, in which the pair eat snacks on a rollercoaster dressed as scouts, in a similar fashion to a group of scouts in one legendary edition of Jim'll Fix It. David Foxxe, Paul Putner, Rowland Rivron, Rhys Thomas, and Julie T. Wallace appeared throughout the brief series. The script editor was Barry Cryer.",
