    "introduction": "It was 1969,headlings blaring war and civil unrest while John Lennon and Yoko Ono were in love.The eccentric rock'n'roll couple had just gotten married.More than happy to be together,they wanted to change the world.So,lying in a hotel bed surrounded by journalists,they announced their mission for peace and invited the rest of the world to symbolically climb into bed with them and share their dream.People called them silly...naive...even ridiculous...yet one famous couple's bed-in spread new hope that there really could be an end to war,hate and violence.Here is rare footage from that amazing time,including the infamous bedside confrontation between John and conservative cartoonist AL Capp,meeting Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and unsuccessfully trying to  organize a free international rock'n'roll festival for peace.Twenty years after Lennon's murder by a crazed fan,Yoko Ono and others involved in the peace mission reflect on the events of that magical,mystical year.",
