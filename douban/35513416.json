    "introduction": "Piotr is looking for a purpose and order in his life. To find it, he turns to magic, religion, and psychology. Unexpectedly, his father calls him and asks Piotr to come to his family home immediately. Piotr arrives at the same time with his sister, Marta, whom he hardly remembers and does not recognize. The father called for Piotr and Marta because their Mother went missing. Family members who meet for the first time after many years begin to search together. The facts they discover about their mother make them re-define what kind of family they are. They follow increasingly stranger paths to finally discover the surprising truth. Torn between grotesque and realism, the film DEAR ONES is a portrait of the characters who, confronted with each other, try to organize their relationships.",
