    "introduction": "Documents the death and destruction that followed the Japanese occupation. So sickening was the spectacle that one Nazi representative in the city, a Schindler-like businessman named John Rabe, was moved to save a quarter million Chinese. This presentation draws extensively on Rabe's 1,200-page diary for a unique perspective on this tragedy. Interviews with descendants of the victims and eyewitnesses to the crimes along with gruesome photos help separate fact from fiction, while scholars and historians reflect on the legacy of this shattering event.",
