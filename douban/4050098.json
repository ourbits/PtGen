    "introduction": "An unusual story of the meeting of two completely different people, in whose fate intervenes great love, but also morbid jealousy, along with human pettiness and cowardice. Jiri Hanibal, author of the screenplay, do not change their original profession - film director. His text reveals a strong cinematic vision and imagination, qualities which are offered for each scenario just normal. His \"Girl and the Magician\" is the story of two very different people. Socially, and character generation. And this story from the time of German occupation is not originally developed Hannibal, but carries in itself and a strong emotional charge. Girl polo?idovka, which is hidden underground village inn and feel is considered to be indebted to the landlord, persuaded to leave itinerant musician and magician, who performs there at random, to leave the hideout and walked with him on the road. Their journey, however, rather as a way for each other, to align human and personal, the girl and the magician appears deepest sense of such concepts and feelings such as tolerance, responsibility and love. And all this with the author set in the Protectorate, the environment of the Czech countryside, where, as elsewhere, we find fear, cowardice and heroism. During his dramatic and risky path of the common Czech countryside, the two main protagonists (and only them) not only learn more about each other, but also the person themselves - on the borders of their humanity, bravery, tolerance and love.",
