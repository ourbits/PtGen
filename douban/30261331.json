    "introduction": "Shadow of the Boomerang is the story of an American brother and sister, Bob and Kathy Prince, who move to Australia to manage a cattle station owned by their father. Bob has a racist attitude and always has a negative word to add. Kathy on the other hand is a sincere and lovable character providing a reasonable balance. But after hearing a message by evangelist Billy Graham on the radio, Bob has a change of heart and learns to accept the Aboriginal people. Shadow of the Boomerang incorporates the Christian message into cinema. Seeing a person turn and make an active decision to follow Jesus doesn't happen in many films. Many have explored the issues of spirituality, religion and God, yet Shadow of the Boomerang makes it clear that Jesus is the focus, not an ambiguous 'spiritual meaning'.",
