    "introduction": "Ilham is 12 years old and from an early age she has always loved telling stories. Now she makes films on her computer with her own imaginary heroes. But today, Ilham will be concentrating on something else... This “short lesson in cinema” is a two-way conversation, both happy and thoughtful, between a young girl and the director who has chosen to create her portrait. This raises the question: what is a documentary? Ilham films the world around her, including her family and her grandparents. She questions them and then asks herself: how should she film them? What should she say about them? Like Russian dolls, the two films are interlocking: the one by the director and the other by his subject both actively contribute to the creation of an original piece.",
