    "introduction": "In this documentary, director Martin Witz tells the story of the friendship and collaboration between Michael Jary and the homosexual songwriter Bruno Balz. In the roaring twenties and then during the Nazi era, the two produced many hits for escapist musicals, especially for superstar Zarah Leander. Using subversive overtones, they try to destabilise Goebbels’ propaganda. Contemporary witnesses, who are eager to tell stories, take us on a brilliant journey through five decades of German film and music history that makes you want to (re)discover forgotten classics and shows how strongly music has shaped popular culture.",
