    "introduction": "After a dinner two of the guests go missing; one of them a police officer who was having an affair with the host's wife and the other a man who had just found a notebook which may have contained a motive to murder or to be murdered! Not long afterwards a body is discovered; strangely it had been prepared for burial; it would seem that somebody had switched bodies at the funeral directors to ensure that a murder victim was cremated… the only question is who was the victim. With Hathaway on holiday Lewis finds himself with a new partner; DC Grey. Together they try to figure out who was cremated and why. Inevitably there is another death and a couple of attempted murders before the crime is solved.",
