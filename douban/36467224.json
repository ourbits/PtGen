    "introduction": "Hailing from Guimarães, a talented photographer and screenwriter of films by Rodrigo Areias, Paulo Abreu, and Manuel Mozos, makes his directorial debut, combining his favorite art forms. He tells the story of the fictional city of Penúmbria, which, due to permanent cloudiness, violent ocean surges, and barren land, is unfit for habitation. And yet, it endures for 200 years, even though almost all of its inhabitants have decided to leave. Such melancholy and such light are few and far between when it comes to cinema.源自：https://www.nowehoryzonty.pl/vod-film.s?id=12872",
