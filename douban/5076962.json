    "introduction": "John Livingston is a rich mama's-boy, who owns a blooded dog named Paul. Paul meets Maggie Mutt, and Paul, being a pedigree canine and somewhat of a cad, lures trusting Maggie to the barn to have his way. He then departs for his palatial doghouse at the Livingston estate. Meanwhile Maggie is brokenhearted and also finds that she is in a \"family way\", and gives birth to a pup she names Hank. Maggie tells Hank to find his \"human\", and departs the scene. Hank goes to the park, meets a \"human\" named Mary Kelly, who is a homeless waif and sweetheart of poverty, and the two adopt each other. Later on in the park Paul comes strolling along with his \"human\", John. A child falls into the lake and Paul and Hank team up to save her. This leads their \"humans\" to strike up a conversation, and the male human falls in love with the female human, and takes her home to meet his aristocratic mother and expresses his desire to marry Mary. John's mother is having none of this and objects strongly, especially since neither Hank nor his human, Mary, have a pedigree. But of course John's mother does not know that Hank is Paul's illegitimate pup. Also John's mother has other plans for him which include his marriage to Cecile Adams, who has a high-society pedigree but does not have a dog.",
