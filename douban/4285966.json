Meanwhile his dad, Tejo, does not only like badminton, he is even obsessed with the living legend of national badminton, Liem Swie King. His admiration to King since his youth turns into an obsession that he hands down to his son, Guntur.Tejo wants Guntur to be like King. Thus this man who works as a shuttlecock maker trains his son harshly, with the exact same training that King received long time ago. “King” is about the quest of a boy in reaching his dreams; that going against all odds is not impossible, just as his wooden racket does not stop him to become a world champion.",
