    "introduction": "This critically acclaimed series, which proved a ratings success when it first aired on Comedy Central earlier in the year, with a second season to follow in 2014, is curated by STEWART LEE and features a cast of highly individual award-winning and break-through comedians, including TONY LAW, SIMON MUNNERY, ISY SUTTIE, DAVID O’DOHERTY, PAUL FOOT, ANDY ZALTZMAN, HENNING WEHN, JOSIE LONG, ELEANOR TIERNAN, DAVID KAY and BRIDGET CHRISTIE.THE ALTERNATIVE COMEDY EXPERIENCE was filmed in front of a real comedy club audience at THE STAND COMEDY CLUB in EDINBURGH, faithfully capturing the unique atmosphere of one of the UK’s favourite and longest established live comedy clubs. It showcases a mix of modern day comedians offering material possibly too clever, thoughtful, radical, satirical, strange, or downright stupid to make it onto more mainstream stand-up outlets.",
