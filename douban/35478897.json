    "introduction": "A tragicomic picture of the Polish society at the time of the first lockdown. Residents of a townhouse – each locked in their own apartment – are trying to adjust to a new situation. The majority remain at home and their only point of contact with the outside world is via a balcony and a common backyard. Isolation and physical distance abruptly limited the number of social interactions but also became an opportunity to observe the lives of our neighbours. The product of this backyard culture is Balcony Concert – a story of a pair of shoes and one of the most peculiar performances of What a Wonderful World.",
