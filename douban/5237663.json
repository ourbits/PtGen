This forces the President of the United States to reactivate  the Florida Militia in a last ditch effort to restore order and stability to the area.  The Militia is ordered to shoot all looters on site and they gun down and kill one particular looter  that will come back to haunt them.  The looter’s grandmother is a Voodoo Queen and she decides she isn’t going to sit by without taking some action to avenge her grandson’s death.  The Voodoo Grandma seeks revenge on the Militia.",
