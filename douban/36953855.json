    "introduction": "Tribalism, racism, discrimination and losing white privilege - a montage film asking why it is that we still live in a divided world. At a time when our headlines are dominated by ethnic violence, religious conflict and remorseless anti-immigration policies, TRIBALISM IS KILLING US is a deeply evocative feature-length essay film that seeks to illuminate the roots of humanity's darkest truth. In an unflinching landmark documentary Sundance and BAFTA-nominated filmmaker Tina Gharavi takes an urgent and much-needed look at tribalism and the process of 'othering' or how we create insider/outsider groups. More importantly, the film examines the application of race as an instrument within strategies for power for dominant groups in contemporary society through Trump, Brexit, and the global rise of the far right.",
