    "introduction": "The brilliant illui \"a young Torah prodigy\" Noah leaves the religious community at the age of 18, and is shunned entirely by his Hasidic family. After 7 years of total disconnect, the family patriarch passes away. According to the father's request, all siblings must be present at the reading of the will, including the secular Noah. For the first time in years Noah and his siblings meet in a small apartment in the heart of Jerusalem's ultra-Orthodox Mea Shearim neighborhood \"for the Hasidic population, life in Mea Shearim - close to the site of the Holy Temple - is in itself holy\". Together they wait for the lawyer to arrive with the father's will. The atmosphere in the room is tense, the wait seems to drag out especially long. It seems as if everyone wishes to forget the rift between them in years and differences. This gathering slowly becomes an acceptance of his death - of the deceased and of him who is alive.",
