After she informs him that she is performing as the lead with her dance troop, she invites him to her recital. Madeline is visually nervous until her enthusiastic, charming and a little off dance instructor Andvari bursts in and helps calm her nerves. She is now ready to perform her part. However there is something about both Andvari and her part, that does not quite meet the eye. After Madeline takes center stage Tyler arrives and he cannot believe what he sees. His life is forever changed.",
