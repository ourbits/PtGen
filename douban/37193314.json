    "introduction": "Part drama, part comedy with a hint of romance, Greek Philosophia and Chickens follows a sixty-something best-selling romance author who, feeling invisible as woman, hires an assassin to take her out. We meet Tessa on a day she's decided that she's had enough. She's ending it all, only she can't do it herself so she's hired an assassin to do it for her. Satisfied with the order of her home affairs, she sets out to meet him, a man she chooses to name \"Keith\". As the day progresses, Tessa encounters a chef/restaurant owner, Niko, and his vivacious waitress mother, Katina, from whom she learns a Greek philosophy/saying that really gets her thinking maybe...? I mean, she is Katina, a Greek woman in her late seventies who's full of life and is dating a man ten years younger than her, so she may be right when she says, \"the old chicken's got the juice.\"",
