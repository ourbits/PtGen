    "introduction": "Gerald King, a \"masher\" of advancing years, rides on the platform of a streetcar one morning and insists upon talking to pretty little Suzanne, a post office clerk. He follows her to the Martinville post office and discovers in what department she is engaged, and also finds out her name. Gerald then asked at the General Delivery window for letters which he knows cannot be waiting him, but whilst he excites the admiration of an elderly lady customer, his efforts at enchanting the lovely Suzanne meet with scant success. In fact he becomes such a nuisance that Suzanne only rids herself of him by slamming the window upon his fingers. Gerald, however, is pachydermous as an elephant, and will not accept rebuff. He goes home and calls up on the phone in order to renew his protestations of eternal affection, but is again frustrated in his amorous intentions.",
