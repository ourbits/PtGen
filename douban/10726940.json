Instead of keeping this terrible secret, he reaches out, trying to set boundaries and prevent himself from hurting anyone. But how will the world react to someone like him? What resources are available to help him manage his conflicting desires? The bravery of both filmmakers and subject here deserves attention. How do we confront and treat a problem that is not going away?",
