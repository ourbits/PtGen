Secretly in love with Alyosha, his friend’s older sister, Jeff experiences intense emotions during this extraordinary stay where he also becomes a sensitive witness to the sometimes toxic power dynamics of a pack of adults. He wishes he could count on Blake, but the possible mentor turns out to be not the role model he had hoped for.",
