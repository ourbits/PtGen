    "introduction": "It’s been ten years since we last went to Billericay to spend Christmas with the Shipmans and the Wests.This year we’re off to Wales for the festivities, where Bryn is cooking dinner for 13 people. Understandably he’s tense. Pam would secretly prefer to spend Christmas in Essex as she finds Gwen’s house a bit lacking, but the deal has always been that they alternate every year, and this time it’s the turn of the Wests to host Christmas with everyone under one small roof.For Gavin and Stacey, parenthood continues to present them with several challenges, their ‘baby’ now being ten. Smithy, too, continues to commit to his fatherly role, making the journey to Barry at weekends and every second Wednesday to see 12 year-old Neil the Baby.Nessa on the other hand adopts her own brand of Nessa-style mothering, whilst Pam, Mick and Gwen have become the epitome of doting grandparents. On Christmas Eve, Dawn makes a shocking discovery about Pete that jeopardizes their marriage (again) and a visit to the pub that night is an eye opener in more ways than one.Sit back and enjoy a welcome return to the award-winning world of Gavin and Stacey and top off your Christmas Day with a big festive cwtch from these well-loved characters.Gavin & Stacey Christmas Special, a 1x60’ is a Fulwell 73, Tidy Productions and Baby Cow Production for BBC One.
