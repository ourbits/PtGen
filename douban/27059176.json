    "introduction": "The series \"Deliver at any price,\" tells the story of how the fall of 1941 the Soviet Union citizens still piously believed that the Soviet army is invincible, and the war with Nazi Germany did not last long. However, in spite of this belief, the Soviet authorities ordered the evacuation to the rear not only objects of historical value, but also plants and factories. The evacuation has reached the provincial hinterland: hence ordered to take out the exhibits of the museum, which is located within the ancient walls of the monastery. A middle-aged professor, his young daughter, Asya and guard Fedenka - that's all its employees. It is on them, and put an honorable mission to save the values belonging to the Soviet people. And among all the treasures of the museum there is a particularly valuable exhibit - it was assumed that he would become the pearl of the exhibition, which was supposed to supervise himself the leader of the Soviet people - Stalin. But the Germans also not averse to take possession of valuable bagatelle.",
