    "introduction": "is an Australian feature film based on several true stories involving people entering Australia illegally along the continent's vast, remote coastline.Set in Western Australia in 1990, Lucky Miles unfolds as a traditional Australian tale of men wandering lost into the desert (echoing the national story of Burke and Wills), but with a bold twist Lucky Miles updates this grand narrative to reflect the contemporary geo-political realities of the Australasian region. Charting a delicate course between comedy and tragedy, all the while waltzing into one of Australia’s most contentious political issues, Lucky Miles' Director Michael James Rowland and Producers Jo Dyer and Lesley Dyer go where angels fear to tread, and successfully it would seem, based on early festival reviews in Variety [1], The Age [2] and The Advertiser [3]. Lucky Miles premiered at the 2007 Adelaide Film Festival where it was chosen to be the opening night film. A few weeks later, competing against the best of global cinema Lucky Miles won the audience award for Best Film at the 2007 Sydney Film Festival, a feat not often achieved by an Australian film (the 2006 winner was independent American film Little Miss Sunshine). Other awards won by Lucky Miles include the Special Jury Prize at the 2007 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic and Best Screenplay at the Vladivostok International Film Festival (an award that carries with it a Russian publishing deal). Out-of-competition Lucky Miles continues to screen at world cinema festivals including Jerusalem, Womad, Pusan, Chicago, Abdu Dharbi, AFI (USA) and the Amazonas Film Festival in Manaus. Lucky Miles opened nationally in Australia mid July. All suggestions are Rowland's debut feature Lucky Miles will be a notable, global cinema release in 07-08, pitching for its strongest audiences in Australia, Europe and Asia.",
