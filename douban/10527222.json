    "introduction": "The feeling of uneasiness instilled by Michaël Borremans (b. 1963) and the technical virtuosity in so much of his work speak to us. The references to Flemish painting and even more so to Manet come to mind, but represented scenes bring us closer to the present-day world with echoes of 40s movies and most of all to Belgian surrealism.",
