    "introduction": "Three generations of women discuss their inner emotions and their interaction with society in this drama from longtime Jean-Luc Godard protégé Anne-Marie Mieville. She uses the sudden editing stops seen in Godard's early work to tell the story of these noble women who live in a world dominated by incurably egomaniacal men who are incapable of satisfying the basic needs of women. Odile (Helene Rousel) is the grandmother, whose job with a car salesman has turned into a necessity she can't afford to give up. Agnes (Anny Romand), Odile's 40-year-old daughter is an intellectual who never married. Although she has had relationships with men, she is seriously questioning their usefulness at this stage in her life. Granddaughter Angele (Gaele le Roi) is a 20-year-old vocal student who contemplates having a child to keep her relationship alive with a boyfriend who is not ready for the responsibilities of fatherhood.",
