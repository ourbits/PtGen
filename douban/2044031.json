Meanwhile Connor achieves his dream and moves in with Abby, to the amazement of his friends Tom and Duncan, who decide to put a tracker on him and thereby follow the team to a sport stadium where another anomaly has opened in the restaurant kitchens. Tom and Duncan manage to take a dodo home with them before they realize it has a very nasty bite.",
