    "introduction": "João Pedro Rodrigues' ESTC graduation short film.Formally assured, and consisting mostly of long shots, it tells the story of a shepherd who, at the age of 65, is forced to retire. It is unsurprising to learn that António Reis was one of Rodrigues' teachers at ESTC, considering how much it reminded me of Reis' own semi-ethnographic portrayals of quotidian rural life in Trás-os-Montes and Ana. Still, it is a mere curiosity.",
