    "introduction": "In a four-part SBS documentary event, FRAMED sees Marc Fennell investigate the victimless crime that left a trail of victims. When Pablo Picasso’s Weeping Woman simply vanished from the walls of The National Gallery of Victoria in 1986, what ensued was a true crime sensation that played out in the daily headlines, as thieves openly taunted authorities with a series of bizarre ransom notes. Fingers were pointed, mud was thrown, and suspects were interviewed and discarded - but that’s only the beginning.",
