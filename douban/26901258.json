    "introduction": "Forged in Fire is an American reality television competition series that airs on the History channel, and is produced by Outpost Entert ainment, a Leftfield Entertainment company. In each episode, four bladesmiths compete in a three-round elimination contest to forge bladed weapons, with the overall winner receiving $10000 and the day's championship title. The series is hosted by Wil Willis, with a three-judge panel consisting of J. Neilson, David Baker, and Doug Marcaida, experts in weapon history and use. During Season 3, Neilson took a leave of absence in order to have surgery on his hand; Jason Knight, another ABS Master Smith, filled his seat on the judges' panel during this time.",
