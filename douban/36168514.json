    "introduction": "The seventh series of Junior Bake Off began on 10 January 2022, with 16 contestants competing to be crowned the series 7 winner. Comedian Harry Hill and bakers Liam Charles and Ravneet Gill returned as host and judges respectively. From episodes 1–3, Paul Hollywood stood in for Charles. The bakers will be divided into two groups of 8, with four eliminated from each group over five days of competition. The remaining four bakers from each group will be combined in the week-long finals, culminating in a \"super-difficult showdown\" episode that determines the winner. Kezia won the 2022 series.",
