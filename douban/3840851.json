    "introduction": "A family with one kid (8-10 years old) that cannot talk and hear arrives at a small town for vacation if I remember right. The small deaf boy start hearing tiny voices seeing things and little by little the story of torture and violence of a group of kids without parents is revealing for him. He visited the old house where they lived and they showed him what happened and who were their executors which are still alive. They asked him for help to punish their torturers in the thrilling final of the movie. A masterpiece of the horror genre. One of the best. The music also is remarkable.imdb comment",
