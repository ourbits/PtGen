    "introduction": "Further adventures of Bentzi, Yuda'leh and Momo in their relentless pursuit of sex in 1950's Israel. Bentzi is frustrated because his steady girlfriend Shelly will not go all the way. He meets the girl who dumped him in the first movie in this series, Nili, who is more than eager to go all the way. The problem is, she goes all the way with every guy she meets. Still, Bentzi breaks up with Shelly in favor of Nili. Meanwhile, Bentzi's voluptuous cousin visits from Europe. One evening finds Momo eagerly servicing her. She is not satisfied by him and invites the obese Yuda'leh to mount her. A funny thing happened, but before it could be resolved, Bentzi's Father comes along and catches them, and takes off after Yuda'leh, beating him with a shoe. Bentzi is beaten to a pulp by one of Nili's older lovers, but stays with her. He visits her one night only to find her entertaining another male visitor. She orders him to make tea as if he is a servant. Suddenly lights go off in Bentzi's head and he tells Nili to stuff it. He goes to find Shelly. - Tim the Bald, IMDb",
