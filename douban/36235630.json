    "introduction": "Adored by Harry Styles and the Haim sisters, they were once loved by Tom Petty, too. The Zombies are a true legend that began 60 years ago in the British provinces. A group of teenagers raised in the local pub culture soon proved it to the world that the Beatles were not everything. Today, these rock veterans have not lost any vigour, either. They will tell us the story of the band from the time of the great explosion of this genre to the modern day and explain how the band’s style has been changing, too. Despite grey hair or poor health, the Zombies seem to be immortal.源自：https://www.krakowfilmfestival.pl/en/online-cinema/film/4184-hung-up-on-a-dream-the-zombies-documentary/",
