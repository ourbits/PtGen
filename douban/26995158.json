    "introduction": "Another missing piece of TV, 5 November 2006Author: mancalleddog1 from Tampa, Florida*** This review may contain spoilers ***Man, just to see this again..Suzanne Pleshette was great as the producer of a typically trashy soap that gets beset by a series of murders that begin to decimate the cast of her bread and butter show. The shadowy freak that stalks the cast has an unnerving sort of broken hum after each dispatch and there is a nice scare or two within the proceedings. If you pay VERY close attention you can spot the killer early on but since I suck at guessing who the maniac is, I lucked out by looking at the T.v. guide ad: shadowy lunatic standing in a doorway over a terrified female victim (The killer's hair only matched ONE of the actors in the film so I was able to pay attention to that one's motives). Anyhow, this is good stuff and is definitely T.v.'s entry into the stalk & slash subgenre of terror flicks. Very hard to come by and almost no-one knows of it or its whereabouts. It would be very cool if someone out there comes across this and starts to circulate it. also..VERY VERY HUGE MOMENTOUS SPOILER ALERT..STOP READING RIGHT HERE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN OR KNOW NOTHING OF THIS FILM: the standout ending will either alienate or please those who have seen 'April Fool's Day' in the fact that when all is said and done it turns out to be a staged ploy (in this film though, it was the wrapping up of principal filming of the proceeding events)..At the time of its broadcast, I thought 'Fantasies' was a great stalker flick with a fantastic ending.",
