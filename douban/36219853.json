    "introduction": "In 1951, the legendary musicologist Alan Lomax came to Ireland as the first stop on a mission to preserve the traditional music of the world. His travels up and down the west coast recording the songs of its people produced Ireland, the seminal album that helped ignite the trad revival of the 1970s and whose influence carries to this day.Through breathtaking archival footage and interviews with contemporary artists, and featuring exclusive performances by Steve Earle, Clannad, Nell Ní Chróinín and Slow Moving Clouds, Lomax in Éirinn uncovers the story of how an American song-collector made an indelible mark on Irish cultural history and forever changed the way Ireland was perceived across the globe",
