    "introduction": "Summer in Copenhagen. Best friends Ronja and Serb are restless souls in their mid-twenties struggling to navigate life. As one joins a secret activist network, and the other falls in love with a mysterious girl, a series of increasingly unlikely events unfold, and the line between reality and fiction begins to erode. Timelines diverge and doppelgängers appear out of nowhere in an endless array of bright summer nights, where everyone is equally chasing euphoria and trying to find meaning. \"The Great Glitch / Children of Paradise\" is an otherworldly film about the time in life when strangers will turn into friends, and friends turn into lovers, and lovers mysteriously disappear in the middle of the night",
