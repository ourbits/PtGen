Infused with dark humor and set behind the doors of a secluded home in Malibu, Den Jorgensen's seemingly idyllic life is permanently altered when his son David, a swaggering 16-year-old homophobe, unexpectedly arrives at his doorstep. David's arrival forces Den to confront his already problematic relationship and, eventually, all three men are compelled to join together to redefine the concept of what constitutes a family.",
