    "introduction": "Professor Sretenski is a scientist and director of a research center in Russia. He is separated from his wife and lives alone. His daughter, who lives with the mother, comes to his home and stays with him for a period, leaving her daughter with him. He raises his granddaughter, feeling a great affection for her. Meanwhile, a former disciple of Sretenski motivates him to study again his former research. This very slow Russian low budget movie is supported by magnificent interpretation of the cast and a fine and sensitive direction. The main idea is to show the love of Sretenski for the three women of his life: his wife, who left him to live with an accountant; his daughter, who had some sort of emotional problem and changed husband almost as much as she changed clothes; and his granddaughter, who was raised by him, creating a great emotional bond between them. His love for research is also touched, when his former student motivates him to come back to his former work. The major problem is, besides the language, the `jumps' in time, showing older characters and not situating the event in time. You see, for example, the baby granddaughter in one scene, and in the next one, she is a young woman without much information to the viewer. Therefore, you have to identify who is she in a birthday (or wedding) party and what is happening. It seems that the story would be much longer, and was cut in the edition. Anyway, it is a beautiful movie, indicated for sensitive viewers.",
