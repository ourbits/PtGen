    "introduction": "Sarathsiri is a forty-five years old man living in his two-storey house located in the middle of tea plantations. The ground floor has been turned into a pawnshop; he lives alone on the first floor and his only entertainment is to look at wrestling matches on TV. Selvi is a twentyfour years old young woman who often comes to his shop to pawn a few small pieces of jewellery for a few rupees. With the help of his main servant, Sarathsiri finds out that Selvi is a Tamil from North Sri Lanka sent by her parents to this part of the country to be safe from the war. She lives with her two aunts. Sarathsiri asks her to marry him.\"When adapting F. Dostoyevsky novel The Meek One, I based this upon the biggest issue of our country which is the ethnic conflict. We live in a society which still has unhealed wounds from a war that lasted over 30 years. Confrontation of a man from the majority Sinhalese and a woman from the Tamil Minority became the dramatic premise of my script. Their struggle with their own past for me was a metaphor for the struggles of the nation as a whole\". -- by Prasanna Vithanage",
