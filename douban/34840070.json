Not only is he a minor celebrity in digital space, he also finds a social stability there that he hasn’t known before. Ellie Wen’s and Barna Szász’s film is a compact interrogation of issues of identity, family and communication – and they understand that on- and offline are not simply a binary opposition but that in either space reality is real and nothing but real.",
