    "introduction": "As Christmas approaches Sidney prepares to marry brassy Linda Morgan to the much older Bill Davis, to the disgust of the groom's son Felix, when Bill is found murdered at the family firm, supposedly the victim of a robbery. Geordie suspects flash Larry Simkins, owner of the strip club where Linda worked and where she met Bill but the nature of the murder reminds Geordie of an identical unsolved case from three years earlier and switches his attentions to the prime suspect at the time, gruff toy-shop owner Albert Tannen, who is violently attacked. Sidney eventually unmasks the killer whilst Mrs Maguire and Leonard deliver her baby for Amanda, pregnant by estranged husband Guy, cast out by her bigoted father and hoping for a future with Sidney.",
