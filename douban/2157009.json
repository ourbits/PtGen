The film episode ends with a sequence showing the return of Soviet tanks to Czechoslovakia.THE NOMADS (segment III) - Nuclear war is apparently raging on the earth. A handful of people including a young girl, all in rags or completely naked are in a fall-out shelter. The \"White Hussar\" (from segment 1) is there too and says he is Death. The girl wants to protect him from the others who want to get rid of him, and in exchange he leads her to the surface of the Earth which is denuded of any trace of life. The girl dies in a deserted windmill. The old man continues his search for people but soon he, too, dies.",
