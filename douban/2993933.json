    "introduction": "A twenty-six year old copy editor with dreams of literary stardom finds inspiration under the most macabre circumstances in this dark crime comedy from director Wil Slocombe. James Cooper is something of a failure; his first book was panned, his agent has dumped him, and he spends his days editing bone-dry textbooks in a dank Chicago basement. To add insult to injury, his girlfriend has recently been dubbed the \"voice of a new America\" by the literati elite. One day, James wakes up to discover his girlfriend's lifeless body splayed out under his bedroom window, and finally realizes that he has something to write about. Now, as James' book becomes a bestseller and readers grow curious to learn more, controversy ignites over the bizarre circumstances surrounding his girlfriend's death, and the author's sordid attempt to cash in on the tragedy.",
