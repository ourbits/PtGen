    "introduction": "This film tells the remarkable story of the Iraqi national soccer team’s journey to become Asian Cup champions in 2007 during the bloodiest days of their country’s civil war. In victory, the national team, made up of Sunni, Shia and Kurdish players, the sons of sworn enemies battling in a bloody war, united their country in its darkest hour. Over a decade later, for the first time ever, the players sit down and tell their story of hardship, uncertainty and fear in a two decade journey to a victory only they believed was possible. \"Lions of Mesopotamia\" tells this untold story of war, football and redemption to remind us all that, even when all hope is lost, love and humanity can prevail.源自：https://schedule.sxsw.com/2024/films/2196832",
