    "introduction": "The story of the University of Brasília, since it was only a project in Darcy Ribeiro's head until the fateful events in August 1968 when its campus was invaded by the police, during the military dictatorship, thus putting an end to its independence.Darcy Ribeiro fight in the beginning of the sixties to create and to implant the University of Brasília. The film shows aggressions for UNB, from the military Coup d'Etat (1964) to the events of 1968, when they were stopped in a block of sports in the campus about 500 students.Memories from a hard past. The idea of this documentary is to give details about what happened in University of Brasilia on 1968. Specifically about the revolt. The movie keeps making circles around the same thing, using interviews with students, professors, politicians and the former dean. The idea is that the audience will make his own opinion about what happened. Wladmir Carvalho is supposed to be only a facilitator. At the end, you can fell that he has his own point of view.",
