    "introduction": "After living in London for 5 years, actress Jo Murphy is back in Dublin. Everyone expected her to make it. She expected to make it. But, she's back in Dublin trying to hide the fact she lives at home with her Mother and is working back at her old greasy cinema, Cine-Lux with her slime-ball manager. Jo has outgrown her old friends- or have they outgrown her? Jo wants to go camping for her birthday but no one will go with her. Actor, Stoney lives in Dublin and has never left. Stoney is broken-hearted over his ex-girlfriend. He owes his druggy-landlord a lot of money for hash and rent. Stoney has no money and he's just been chucked off the dole. Jo and Stoney are old acting comrades and bump into each other at an ad audition. Jo asks Stoney to go on a 'Spa Weekend' with her. She's lying. She wants him to go camping with her. With his landlord hot on his heels, Stoney jumps at the chance at a Spa Weekend. They road-trip it down the countryside with Stoney's landlord (unbeknownst to them) on their tail. Chaos ensues and we find out the real reason Jo is back from London.",
