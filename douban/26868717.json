The two characters do not want to lose their honor as soldiers even though they have committed a crime considered unforgivable in military society and want go through an honorable military trial. The military is not at all concerned with their wishes, and pushes to get them tried as civilians. This causes conflicts that send the story towards an unexpected direction.",
