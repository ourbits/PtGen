Lead actor Christoph Schechinger as prudent psychologist Paul and his therapy dog get to deal with a seriously ill patient and his half-sister, whose sibling love is overshadowed by dysfunctional father-child relationships. In \"Im Schatten dies Vaters\" (\"In the Shadow of the Father\"), Uwe Ochsenknecht slips into the role of a celebrated actor who likes to pretend that he's a good dad - but isn't.",
