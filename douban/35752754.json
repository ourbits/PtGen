    "introduction": "Richard Claxton \"Dick\" Gregory was born October 12, 1932 in St. Louis, Missouri and died in Los Angeles in July 2017. He was 84 years old. In 1961 Dick was the leading black stand up comedian in Chicago and when Hugh Hefner asked him to fill in for fellow comedian Professor Irwin Corey at the Playboy Club the rest is history especially Black American history. Prior to that evening in Chicago, \"A black entertainer in America could sing and dance in front of a white audience but was never allowed to stand flat-footed and address a white audience\". Dick changed all that and from making $25 a week his salary jumped to over $5000 a night. He was at the forefront of the Civil Rights movement and in 1968 he traveled to London with the writer James Baldwin to update the British black community with a progress report. He also ran for president the same year. He was everywhere and with everyone. He inspired generations of people all over world. His legacy and impact will last forever and this film intends to share his contribution to modern American history. Dick had impact.",
