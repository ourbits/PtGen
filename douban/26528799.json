Sadly, Soon-ee has feelings for Eun-gi, a handsome electrician. Dol-soei finally works up the courage to tell Soon-ee that he likes her but she rejects him coldly. One day, Ba-woo, a pudgy electrician with a bad-temper, lures Soon-ee to a dark alley and tries to molest her, but Dol-soei rescues her in time. Regardless of his efforts, Soon-ee is only interested in Eun-gi. Crushed, Dol-soei packs up and leaves the town without a word.",
