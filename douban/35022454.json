    "introduction": "\"My Autopsy\" is a story of the progression of a woman's strength as she journeys to escape the invisible chains of a past abusive relationship. It is an exploration of the darker side of love and obsession, and how an emotional autopsy is sometimes necessary to fully realize our own power. Set in the environment of the gritty local music scene, the film examines Rachel’s fall into the abyss and her ultimate realization of self in a hard hitting, “no holds barred” fashion. It’s sex, drugs, rock and roll, and stream of consciousness poetry with a dreamlike emotional twist.",
