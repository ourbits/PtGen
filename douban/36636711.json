    "introduction": "Colpa del mare originates from a local news event: one morning in July 2017, in Pescara, dozens and dozens of drug packs appeared on the shore, spit out from the sea during the night. Within a few weeks, the competent authorities tried to clarify, there were investigations and arrests, several boys were involved. Colpa del mare is a friendship and sacrifice story. In a detective setting, Colpa del mare shows the story of Luigi and Marco, two young friends who parted ways and both have taken wrong paths over the years. Investigating Marco, a guy in his early twenties, found dead after a party, Colpa del mare reconstructs a chain of human and emotional bonds including friendship and its value within a small province. Someone is guilty, but it is difficult to determine just one fault.",
