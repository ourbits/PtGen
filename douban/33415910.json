    "introduction": "'Comma' is a short film about a conflict of form and substance. The story follows one day in the life and death of Oscar, an architect in his 50s, deeply in love with a young actress. Oscar, an example of a wealthy aesthete, impeccable in every detail of his lifestyle, has prepared an expensive gift for his partner. He becomes increasingly restless as his continued efforts to reach her over the phone fail. Eventually, the actress returns his calls - she is in the process of rehearsing a new play and will be able to meet him once finished. Inpatient and passionate, Oscar sneaks in to see the rehearsal for himself.",
