    "introduction": "ODE TO PASSION is an original Rock Musical Drama built around 18 pop rock songs. It follows a young writer, whose belief in true love is put to the test by a beautiful girl and her struggle with addiction. The film is made unique by its non-musical scenes that are spoken purely in verse. This approach reflects the purity and beauty - as well as the hidden naivety - of young love. Working seamlessly with the musical numbers, it complements the pace of the film to create a constant melodic rhythm, even when no music is present. Broadway veteran Giuseppe Bausilio, as well as Broadway newcomer, Julia Nightingale bring to life this story of young love and the path it is destined to take.",
