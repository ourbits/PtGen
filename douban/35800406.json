    "introduction": "Based on one of Scandinavia’s most beloved folk tales, the film centres on a fearless, curious and adventurous girl, called Liv, who dreams of leaving her home in the woods. When the polar bear Valemon offers her family a way out of poverty if she comes with him, she agrees. A compassionate friendship starts to form between the two – a friendship that could well turn into something deeper. For Valemon is not only a bear, but a prince who was once cursed by a witch. Fearless as she is, and with her charming animal friends by her side, Liv sets out on a journey to confront the dangerous witch and save Prince Valemon.",
