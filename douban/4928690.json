His feelings towards her change constantly every time he goes to Busan. His several visits to Busan show every aspect of love in a compressed way, from the first encounter to the final break-up. What makes Jong-hun’s feeling all the more complicated is the entrance into his life of his ex-girlfriend, Seon-young, and later, new, attractive woman, Seon-hee.",
