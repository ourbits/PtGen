Naomi feels betrayed and left behind, and Gretchen is annoyed with Naomi because she's so morbid. The girls stop for a beer as night falls in a shady town along the Sacramento Delta where they meet a failed hit man, a bartender who doesn't want to serve them, and two cute small town losers. Naomi and Gretchen get separated and find themselves in their own horror films. Eventually Naomi finds Gretchen and everyone learns the hard way never to get in the middle of a catfight. The girls make up and Gretchen's life plan continues on schedule, but not before her betrayal catches up to her and Naomi finally gets her revenge.",
