    "introduction": "Eddie Izzard's finest hour (or two)... If you've never seen Eddie before, this is where to start. Eddie starts at the beginning of time (Biblically) and ends with Armageddon (out of here). On his way he covers the loophole in the great flood story, death and Death, the Trojan War, Bin Hood (he steals from the comfortable and gives to the moderately impoverished), machines and the end of the world.Izzard is an example of British humor at it's finest (and sometimes most surreal) taking his influences from the Goons, Tommy Cooper and Monty Python. He is, however, also very unique. No one else I know of rambles in the most entertaining way Eddie does, sometimes losing the plot himself.",
