    "introduction": "Documentarian David Bradbury brings us an affectionate portrait of the life and work of venerated Australian director Paul Cox.Arguably one of the most important filmmakers to come out of this country, and certainly one of the most prolific, director Paul Cox (Salvation, MIFF 2008; Human Touch, MIFF 2004; Innocence, MIFF 2000) occupies a unique place in the Australian film landscape.A Dutch native who relocated to Melbourne as a teenager in the 60s, Cox went on to make more than 25 feature films over the next four decades, all highly personal and artistically ambitious.Featuring a who's who of Australian film and intellectual life of the past 30 years - including David Stratton, Phillip Adams, Chris Haywood and Gosia Dobrowski - Bradbury's tribute to the great director delves into Cox's outlook on filmmaking and life, particularly in the wake of his remarkable recent brush with cancer.",
