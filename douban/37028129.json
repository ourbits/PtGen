    "introduction": "Jin Joo-seok works as an insert director on a commercial movie set. When Ma Chu-hyun, who has a strange aura, joins the film team, the two become close and spend the night together. However, the next day, Ma Chu-hyun gets angry with Jin Joo-seok for some reason. Afterwards, Jin Joo-seok waits for Ma Chu-hyun with a longing heart. This is the second feature film by director Lee Jong-su, who was invited to the New Currents section and won the KB New Currents Audience Award with Heritage (2023). Like in his previous work, sudden dark humor continues to shine in this film. The unpredictable and distinctive characters are also charming. The film creates an unfamiliar rhythm with witty dialogue, situations, and irregular twists, occasionally suddenly stopping to capture beautiful landscapes and portraits from time to time. It is a sarcastic commentary on cinema, yet above all, a poignant, biting, and charming love story.",
