    "introduction": "From the moment David Brower first witnessed the extraordinary beauty of the Yosemite Valley, his life was tied to the fight to preserve the American wilds for future generations. Not since John Muir had an American fought so hard, or been more successful, in protecting our natural heritage. His fiery dedication and activism helped inspire the modern day environmental movement. Explored is the beautiful, dramatic, and lyrical story of Brower and his colleagues' unrelenting campaigns--fought through lobbying, art, and hard hitting advertising-to-protect and establish some our most treasured national parks. At the center of the film are the themes that absorbed Brewer throughout his life: the threatened beauty of the American earth, the spiritual connection between humans and the great outdoors, and the moral obligation to preserve what is left of the world's natural wonders.",
