    "introduction": "Luna is rebelling. She is a punk singer who lashes out at her friends and peers in the arts community for their indifference. The format of her resistance? A song about Laugo, a construction worker across the street. The song unexpectedly gains popularity, and Luna decides to meet the hero of her song. Laugo surprises her with his naive and honest view of the world – the clash of two worlds will lead to dramatic singing.A flirtation with working lives and revolutionary slogans, inspired by Super Mario and director Jasmin Baumgartner’s interest in directing music videos. She studied at the Film Academy Vienna, trained as an actor and has made television documentaries in Kenya and Iran. Trying to look into the eyes of the western world, she sees the opportunity for criticism in the pure form of a punk rock song.源自：https://rigaiff.lv/en/films-2023/ata-ata-kupu-karali/",
