    "introduction": "Krister, a husband and a father, wakes up bloodied and distressed in what appear to be unfamiliar surroundings. Deeply affected by his experience he tries to regain some normality by setting about his daily routine, but his initial distractedness and sarcasm soon give way to more menacing, erratic and brutal behaviour. Unable to find any peace in the banalities of the quotidian, Krister is forced to face up to the personal horror of what has gone before. This assured second feature from Jesper Ganslandt is at once sensitive, heartfelt and yet gruesome, with quietly menacing scenes confidently punctuated with moments of almost operatic drama. Olle Sarri's performance as Krister is pitch perfect, with his sinister intensity never overshadowing the tragic and at times pathetic core at the heart of his character. Bob Dylan's 'Too Much of Nothing', which plays out over the closing credits, gives a disquieting final hint as to the universality of Krister's ennui. This fresh, disturbing and expertly paced film marks director Ganslandt out as one of Sweden's brightest emerging young talents.Sarah Lutton",
