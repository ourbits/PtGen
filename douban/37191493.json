    "introduction": "Since 202*, all Belgian citizens are legally bound to film themselves 24/7. The MONITORING company is responsible for verifying these images. One day in 202*, between 12h03 and 12h22, the daily lives of a watchman and his human flock cross paths.Monitoring introduces a surveillance company which we discover through the daily round of a watchman responsible for detecting accidents and domestic offences, using technologies which recognize facies, objects and activities. To this end, everyone must constantly film themselves in their own home for preventive purposes, so that their private sphere is secure.",
