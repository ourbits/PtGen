    "introduction": "Johanka (Tereza Vorísková) spends all of her time in her café Laputa. Men come here leave again. Miki, a poet, leaves for Turkey with Johanka's sister; Johanka's old flame Felix returns from distant travels, forms a band and then flies off again to Puerto Rico, where he gets married. Futility stares out at Johanka from every beer mug and so she turns the café into a massage parlor. Apparently nothing has changed, but the cards say it clearly: she should take a look at her life from a distance and realize that this is me, this is my home and this is my family.",
