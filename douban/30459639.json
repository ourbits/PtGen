    "introduction": "Raw film material consists in part of gelatin, which is made of the skin and bones of animals, including horses. The traces of light that shape our audiovisual dreams are thus imprinted on parts of animal bodies. Through the subtle use of audio, this found-footage collage focuses on images of the horse as an attraction, an animal of burden, and a mythological creature.\"In 1900 there were 130,000 working horses in Manhattan. Horses were a central part of our lives. Jeremy Bentham: \"The question is not: can they reason? Nor, can they talk? But, can they suffer?\" M. Hoolboom",
