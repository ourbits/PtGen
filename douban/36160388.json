    "introduction": "Above the shifting currents of contemporary music soars a talented and intriguing composer, Régis Campo. This film takes a closer look at the two years preceding his entry into the Académie des Beaux-Arts. From his concerts all over the world to his two-room Paris apartment where the creative work happens, and his down-time with family in the south of France, this is an intimate documentary on the creation of a musical universe like none other. With its emphasis on joy, humour, and melodic invention in every tempo, it is a portrait of an outstanding French composer whose music, taken from an impressive catalogue of more than 300 works, has been performed in 30 countries.",
