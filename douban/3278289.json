    "introduction": "纪录片关于08年5月发生在玻利维亚Sucre市对印第安原住民的种族歧视事件。Documentary about the acts of violence against indigenous people in the city of Sucre (Bolivia) the day of may 24th of 2008.To highlight these guys commitment to \"democracy and liberty\", on the eve of the election, when a documentary by the renowned Bolivian and sucreno director Cesar Brie, \"Humillados y Ofendidos\" about the May 24th violence was supposed to be aired on Bolivian television, the city's transmission cables were cut, a doc previously censored by Sucre's broadcasters. Jaime Barron blamed the government, claiming they were attempting to create an excuse for \"canceling the election\". It only makes sense then that two student members of the \"Local University Federation\" were detained outside the Departmental Electoral Court with 27 dynamite detonators, whom the government claims were sought immediately released by opposition PODEMOS party bosses.",
