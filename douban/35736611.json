    "introduction": "Tori, a social media influencer/celebrity, disappears a month after going public with her relationship by posting her first picture of her and her boyfriend. In the style of 'The Dead Girl' and 'Crash', the story unfolds from five points of view; a student who is a social outcast, a disgruntled assistant to a talent manager, a forum moderator who brags, a singer who has insecurities with regard to her boyfriend and the missing social media influencer herself. The first four episodes on the respective characters turn out to be cyber bullies. The story explores their responses to the disappearance, ranging from guilt, indifference, celebration or sadness. The bullies are seen as regular people, but with dark secrets. Their views may change when it is revealed that Tori has taken her own life. The last episode puts audience in the view of the victim. She struggles to put brave fronts until she is pushed to the edge. Audience will see how cyberbullying affects people.",
