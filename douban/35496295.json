Local man Glukhov organises the hunt, expecting the Canadian to help him close a deal for millions of euros. However, Yovo the Beggar — a former miner, owner of an improvised zoo and perpetual joker — intervenes as he is the only one who has a perfect dog for hunting. Glukhov’s plan goes upside down and nothing will fall into place until he sets his old scores with Yovo.",
