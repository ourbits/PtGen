    "introduction": "\"Everything Moves Alone\" opens in a sleepy New England town where Scotch, a recently discharged soldier, arrives at a bus depot with the vague plan of crashing with his long-estranged older brother. Scotch spies a creepy yet interesting character stealing luggage, who then offers Scotch a ride into town if he will assist in dropping dirt and a frog-shaped flower pot into another man's car. Scotch, who is clearly several cards short of a full deck, complies and immediately earns the wrath of the car owner McDunley, a bearish sourpuss who runs the local video store and who has a mysterious long-running feud with Anderson, the luggage-thief who quickly becomes Scotch's new best friend.",
