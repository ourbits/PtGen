    "introduction": "9-year old girl, vacationing with her parents in a remote bog, gets trapped in a secret bunker where an AI-startup is nearing the completion of a superintelligent AI. Both the girl and the AI want to escape. Child Machine is an AI-gone-wrong story that’s authentic, fun and interesting for all ages, made to be watched by young adults as well as their parents. The film is one of the first narrative feature films ever to have real AI-generated visual effects, made using cutting edge AI technologies that have only been in existence for a few months.源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/child-machine/",
