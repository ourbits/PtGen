    "introduction": "At \"featurette\"-length, this is the longest cartoon of the disc. The extended running time gives it room to have a plot and be more than just funny and cute. It winds up being one of the more memorable pieces of the set. It tells the story of Amos, a poor mouse (voiced by -- who else? -- Sterling Holloway), who is truly responsible for all of Benjamin Franklin's innovations in the 1740s, from the bifocals to the printing press, from the lightning rod to the furnace stove. Their relationship is electric, but rewarding (at least for Franklin). Years later, Amos reunites with Franklin to help America frame the Constitution. Sure, this entirely robs one of the most revered founding fathers of his agency, but it's all in good fun and it's a charming, clever little tale.",
