    "introduction": "Director Ali-Reza Amini makes an affecting directorial debut with this touching, humorous neorealist film from Iran. Recalling his own days as a soldier in Iran's army, Amini shows a barracks of mostly illiterate young men, enduring their required service in the military, confined in a snowbound camp near Tehran. Their only contact with the outside world is through a small tape recorder, smuggled in by one of the men. 76 min. Standard; Soundtrack: Farsi; Subtitles: English. In Farsi with English subtitles.",
