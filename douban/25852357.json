Ten months later Adam meets Yusef, the Muslim imam, in a dilapidated children's playground where he has taken baby Katie and they decide to join forces to raise money for its renovation. Yusef does very well, collecting most of the money - despite being electrocuted by the church's faulty wiring system. This is as well as most of Adam's funds come from Colin selling crack cocaine. Both Christians and Muslims, however, put the Smallbones under pressure to have Katie baptized.",
