Living in a caravan with Ukrainian girlfriend Sonja whilst his dream house is built he has a (poorly-selling ) autobiography,entitled Bouncing Back. A chance meeting at the garage where Michael now works with his old headmaster leads to an invitation to address the sixth-form - a predictable disaster. Meeting former school-mate Phil,now a teacher,recalls a bitter memory when Alan was caned for something Phil had done and a row which sees him ejected from the premises. Phil comes to the garage to apologise but Alan is intent on revenge - leading to him being besieged in the garage.",
