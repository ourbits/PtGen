    "introduction": "In March 2019, Amos Dov Silver was arrested at a Kyiv hotel following a global sting operation. Silver, the creator of the Telegrass drug-dealing mobile app, has since been accused by the government of running a crime organisation, but for thousands of Israelis Silver is a fearless folk hero intent on exposing a corrupt and broken system. Through exclusive footage of Silver, his family and his partners’ investigations, as well as secretly filmed footage of Silver in the Ukrainian prison, a polarising portrayal of this man emerges: is he a champion of the people, or a lost soul corrupted by power?源自：https://wff.pl/en/film/silvers-uprising",
