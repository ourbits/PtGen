    "introduction": "Bradley Walsh: Egypt's Cosmic Code charts Bradley Walsh's first trip to Egypt in search of answers to some of Ancient History's biggest mysteries - who built the pyramids, why and how? Could Ancient Egyptians have supernatural abilities, and is the Great Sphinx much older than we think? This three-part series sees Bradley fulfil a lifetime’s ambition to visit the monuments of Ancient Egypt and try to understand how it could have been possible to produce such 'wonders of the ancient world' 4,500 years ago. Apprenticed to Rolls Royce long before he embarked on his stellar TV career, Bradley has had an enduring fascination with ancient engineering and with the idea that the construction feats of our ancient forebears could only have been possible with the participation of some 'other worldly' or extraterrestrial influence.",
