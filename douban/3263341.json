Once in town, she encounters great difficulty adapting to city life.Biela is a timid country girl, who has always lived on a large but family-worked farm with her father, her only original family member. When the father dies, she moves to her cousin's house in town, as he becomes her tutor and estate administrator. His wife (Eliane Giardini), genuinely warm and well-intentioned, attempts to help Biela adapt to the town's social life, trying to transform the very rough country bumpkin into some resemblance of a city girl. But, Biela only feels at ease in the company of her element, the simple and rustic hired help. She even insists in taking her meals in the servant's cantine, and enventually wants to move into the domestics' sleeping quarters. Meanwhile, she meets Modesto, starting a very shy, somewhat forced relationship. But, the young man travels away and does not return, makinh Biela feel humiliated and miserable. One day, when she rescues a stray dog on the street, she finally starts to follow, and stick to, her own (\"secret\") way of life.",
