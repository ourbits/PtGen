    "introduction": "Capturing his surroundings with a camera, a boy raised in the mountains yearns to squeeze reality. He films his home surroundings creating choppy, chaotic images that match the energetic life of a child. Fleeting glimpses of youth unfold, yet the result is by no means superficial. The boy’s flowing thoughts produce observations that suggest a strikingly philosophical nature. His contemplation of life runs deep, matched by an intense emotional experience. However, typical of childhood, a moment later his attention may be grabbed by something else, something mundane, and he seamlessly transitions from profound reflections to everyday activities like calling the dog or playing with his older sister.",
