    "introduction": "Cecilia, Ana Maria and Rodrigo are part of a young theater group, that have recently received acclaim for their bold and defiant stage productions, demonstrating their commitment to both social and political issues. They are rehearsing for their next production, which is the condemnation of the consumer Society's acceptance of the unacceptable. A society that doesn't question a political and economic system that imposes debt and impoverishment upon the people who are most vulnerable. However, they become aware that presenting such a complex and bloody reality in the way in which they want to demonstrate it to the audience, is fraught with difficulties and little by little they each begin to face an identity crisis, both morally and politically. The demonstrations of March 15 throughout the country interrupt the company's creative process, reaching the point of no return.",
