    "introduction": "It was clearly also influenced by American \"Dirty Harry\" movies and perhaps the cynical Italian police thrillers that were emerging at the time. Naschy, this time,plays a hard-boiled cop who slaps around elderly exhibitionists and makes a wounded biker with a broken leg crawl to the hospital. He is up against \"the Dragonfly Killer\", a vigilante who is offing pimps, prostitutes, and junkies--\"cleaning up the city\" much like the villains in the Dirty Harry sequel \"Magnum Force\" (although his motive for doing so would have made Harry Callahan crap his pants in utter disbelief). Erica Blanc plays Naschy's fashion designer wife who, after one of her gay friends is killed, decides to try to solve the case herself using her \"woman's intuition\". This leads to comical scenes of her sitting naked in bed pouring over grisly crime photos with a magnifying glass, or acting hysterically (albeit much more believably)when the killer sends the severed head of a Turkish pimp to their house.Of course, she stumbles across the identity of the killer before her husband does, leaving Naschy to rush to her rescue.",
