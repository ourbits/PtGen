He hides the tonic in Woody's house hoping to retreive it the next day. When the listless Woody awakes, he imbibes the tonic, giving him the strength of twenty men which he immediately tests. Eventually, \"The Bat\" lures Woody to his hideout in hopes of retrieving his bottle, resulting in a man-to-man (bat?) showdown between Woody and \"The Bat\".",
