    "introduction": "\"University places for the children of farmers and labourers!\" was the cry that went round East Germany after the Second World War.Was this meant to be the symbol of a fairer world? Many who followed the cry hoped it was. Their grateful and bitter memories of this period of preparatory institutes and \"Farmers and Labourers\" faculties give us an insight into a chapter of recent history.In 1962, when the last major \"Farmers and Labourers\" faculties in Berlin, Leipzig, Greifswald, Karl-Marx-Stadt (Chemnitz) and Weimar were closed down it was noted that 20,000 graduates had passed through their doors.",
