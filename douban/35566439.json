    "introduction": "While the Captain is fishing, the kids plant a treasure map on his hook. The rather dim Captain follows it to the island, where the kids have made it easy for him to find what they've prepared. But what they weren't prepared for was Long John Silver, who's followed the Captain and kidnaps him and the treasure chest. The kids head for Silver's ship to help the Captain. Fortunately, what's waiting for John in the treasure chest is a wildcat, which keeps him busy (despite breaks for the ice cream man and a low-flying plane) while the kids untie the Captain. His gratitude is short-lived, when he discovers they were responsible for the whole adventure.",
