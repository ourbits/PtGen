    "introduction": "'A Barman's Aperitif' is a six episode short form Comedy Web Series, about an aging alcoholic Barman, who finally realizes his dream of buying a bar with the help of his sister. He takes the adult passage; the making and drinking of a cocktail, and turns it into a situation of wit, history, clarity and a little bit of irreverence, through his personal life stories, including people he's met in life, patrons and his staff who freely spread their opinions of him behind his back in behind-the-scenes interviews. And there is a twist. It is an unapologetic, suspend your disbelief, broad alcoholic comedy. It is this mans life seen through the eyes of cocktails and the one person who is assisting telling his stories.",
