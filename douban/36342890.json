    "introduction": "Umberto Eco’s private library was a world in itself: more than 30,000 contemporary books and 1,500 rare and antique volumes. The director had worked with Eco one year before the writer’s death on a video project for the Venice Art Biennale in 2015, gaining access to the library. With the help of Eco’s family he has now produced a documentary that describes a one-of-a-kind place, but also tries to catch and represent the universal idea of a library as “memory of the world”, as Eco himself liked to describe it.",
