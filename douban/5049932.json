Climb into the cockpit with him and experience the split-second timing of an emergency landing on an aircraft carrier deck. Roll and dive over France in a World War I Fokker Triplane. Witness a heart-stopping wing-walk on an aerobatic biplane high above the Grand Canyon. A tribute to all pilots, past and present.",
