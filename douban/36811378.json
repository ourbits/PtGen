    "introduction": "The criminal psychologist Annett Schuster and the case analyst Jan Kawig have to solve their first case together when a male body is found near the Wartburg. Huddled in a fridge like the victim is praying. The man was known as the \"Judge Merciless\" at the Higher Regional Court of Erfurt - revenge as a motive is therefore obvious. Annett Schuster finds religious symbols that refer to the Bible quote \"An eye for an eye\". When a second body is discovered near an abandoned church, one thing is clear: the investigators are dealing with a serial killer. The search for clues develops into a macabre game between perpetrators and investigators... The unconventional Jan Kawig is a trained carpenter and Thuringian through and through, while the astute criminal psychologist Annett Schuster returns home from the USA after a few years at Boston University. The new team of operational case analysis is headed by Marion Dörner, who prefers flat hierarchies and has to struggle privately with the excesses of her pubescent sons. The team is complemented by coroner Vanessa Sun and detective inspector Sabine Limmer.",
