    "introduction": "This is a superb presentation of one of the lesser known aspects of the Third Reich. The Block Buster Degenerate Art Show in Germany, 1 936, is detailed with actual footage from the original show along with excellent footage from the recent hanging of all the surviving work from that show back in Berlin. The documentary very effectivly details the history of the German Expressionists and Hitler's collision course with their work and it puts the work into the perspective of Hitler's \"House of German Art,\" the invasion of Poland, and most importantly the liberation of the camps and the burial of the typhoid dead. Its presentation of book burning in Nazi Germany and the connection to the burning of people is profound.Notes & Supplement to the Filmhttp://cla.calpoly.edu/~mriedlsp/History437/Art/Entartete%20Kunst.htm",
