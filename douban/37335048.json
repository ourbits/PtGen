    "introduction": "Wang Hao is in an open relationship with Gezi, a yoga enthusiast. He makes efforts to participate in Gezi's yoga practice every time they spend together, but his possessiveness grows along with physical discomfort. However, he knows that confessing himself would mean losing Gezi. One summer afternoon, they meet on the outskirts. Wang Hao weaves traps with his words, praying for Gezi to fall into them and stay with him, while Gezi remains loyal to her feelings and reiterates her definition of a close relationship. Their verbal dispute concludes with impulsive actions by the lakeside. Gezi promises to stay for the night. Wang Hao’s uncomfortable body finds the most comfortable position at the moment, even if it means curling up and leaning against Gezi's ear. Perhaps, a spontaneous dance of contact is the true interpretation of their relationship.",
