And with this unknown, we will once again live a new summer at the Les Guilles summer camp. It will be a very different summer.This second season will continue to narrate the plots that were left unresolved and incorporate new ones, and the arrival of new characters will bring renewed dynamics, both in terms of friendship and conflicts. The first season revolved around growing up. In this second season, toxic relationships and masculinity are at the core of the new plots. The answer to many conflicts will come from the group's union as a network and a refuge.",
