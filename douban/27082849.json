They kidnap a hot-shot cargo broker in hopes he'll increase their profits so they can retire from a life of crime. Their travels carry them along the rough border of the vast Third Imperium, constantly on the brink of war with its alien neighbors. If they just keep flying, stay out of the war, and avoid other pirates, they just might do the impossible... turn a profit.",
