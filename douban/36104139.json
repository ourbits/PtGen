With protests and uprisings taking place all over the world in the name of justice, we find ourselves in a time where the world is finally ready to hear the voice of the inner city. Asbury Park echoes that voice, revealing a tale of injustice through the eyes of four inner-city youths. They dream of making it out of the hood, but in order to survive, they'll be forced to choose between being law-abiding citizens and doing what's right.",
