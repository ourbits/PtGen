    "introduction": "His most famous novel, \"Nils Holgersson's Wonderful Journey through Sweden\", has accompanied generations of children (and adults), contributed to writing the national novel and conquered readers far beyond the borders of his country. But Selma Lagerlöf's life, a pioneer in many fields, was as rich and exciting as her work. Born in 1858 on the family estate in Marbacka, where she died in 1940, she chose a career as a teacher and then as a writer, refusing marriage for a free and emancipated life in the company of women. During her life, she will write about thirty books. This great feminist was consecrated in 1909, becoming the first woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.",
