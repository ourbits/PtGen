    "introduction": "This movie is more or less a document about a book (Die Stadt ohne Juden) from Hugo Bettauer. As a movie itself it shows the typical problems of a film industry in Vienna in the beginning of the 20's. The legendary Republic of Utopia. Address: Ballhausplatz in Vienna. There is troble. The workers are going out in the streets, the money has lost all its value. In the pubs the people already know the solution: The jews have to be expelled... Die Stadt ohne Juden (The City without Jews) is based on the 1922 novel by Hugo Bettauer. In this novel he dealt with the consequences of the rising antisemitism in a satircial way.It is on a meta level a great pleasure. A lot of very interesting people and locations. In the historical context the movie is one of the most interesting documents we have in the movie history of central Europe. It shows that people had an idea what there future would like to be. The most interesting part is the vision of a Vienna without an important minority. It seems like a vary of stereotypes but its a fact that some visions turned into real.",
