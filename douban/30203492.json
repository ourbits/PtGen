    "introduction": "From the ground, we see almost nothing: we walk on, around, are in the center or next to them, without noticing that lie at our feet significant and mysterious traces.By taking height, we distinguish shapes, designs, and structures. These giant traces finally take shape seen from the sky. The collection \"Earth Signs from Above\" offers an inventory of these strange manifestations, and an investigation that excludes no hypothesis.",
