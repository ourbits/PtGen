    "introduction": "Athens, today. Seventeen-year-old Aria, who is working at Jimmy’s local kebab place is waiting for a driving lesson with her father. When he finally arrives, it is not to go for a drive; on the contrary, he confides in her the care of a young Chinese immigrant who speaks neither Greek nor English.DIRECTOR’S STATEMENTA film, for me, is a collection of moments, which fall into place to create a whole. Sounds, looks, movements, the colors of Athens today tell the story of Aria, Lu and Petros. Image by image, I await the moment that I merge with them through their journey, just as they merge into mine—together accepting that our freedom exists in merely an instant.",
