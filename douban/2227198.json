    "introduction": "thinks about his life as he sits alone in a shabby room in London. He recalls his childhood along the Western Coast of Ireland, and then his days as a laborer as he moved to London from his native land. With no central narrative, I Could Read the Sky concentrates on images of Ireland and England (photographed on both film and videotape), remembered moments with people from the old man's past, and a poetic narration drawn in part from the book of the same name by Timothy O'Grady and Steve Pike. This debut feature by Nicola Bruce made the film festival circuit in 1999, showing at the Edinbugh, Galway, Montreal, and Toronto Film Festivals. SPECIAL FEATURES: Cast/Crew Interview(s), Deleted Scenes, Featurette, Interactive Menu, Photo Gallery, Production Notes,",
