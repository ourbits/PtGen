    "introduction": "The first feature-length documentary to take on the subject of online relationships, IRL (In Real Life) chronicles the life, death and afterlife of an online community called \"The Bronze,\" made up of fans from the official website for \"Buffy, the Vampire Slayer.\" The documentary looks at what happens when online relationships move from the Internet into \"real life.\" In their own words, Bronzers talk about what led them to seek out the community, the prejudices and misconceptions they had to face from family and friends about their Internet activities, and the effect the experience had on their lives.- Written by Stephanie Tuszynski",
