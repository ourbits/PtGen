    "introduction": "The unique film set within a Karaja village in Brazil's Mato Grosso, Jim Jarmusch listens while Sam Fuller describes the 1950's \"Tigrero\" movie that he was unable to make. It also profiles the Karaja people. The non-film \"Tigrero\" had a fascinating history. The name was purchased off a novel by 20th Century Fox by Darryl F. Zanuck. Screen writer Fuller was sent to Brazil to come up with the story. There between two jungle rivers, he meets the Karajas who allow him to film their ceremonies and their village. Upon returning, he wrote a blockbuster film which would have starred John Wayne, Tyrone Power, and Ava Gardner. Because it was to be filmed in the dangerous jungle, Fox nixed the project. A lot of this movie focuses on Jarmusch interacting with the natives. The two also discuss Fuller's career and religion. ~ Sandra Brennan, All Movie Guide",
