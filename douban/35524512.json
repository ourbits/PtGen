    "introduction": "A cinematic collage based on all the surviving Colombian silent cinema, reediting the images so as to create a single imaginary film: the impossible love story between Efraín and Alicia, which crosses the troubled first half of the 20th century in Colombia. What starts as a melodrama, in which Efraín falls in love with Alicia, who’s engaged to the powerful and vindictive Uribe, turns into the account of a journey to the heart of the jungle, during which we’ll witness the humiliating living conditions of southern peasants and the birth of an armed revolt.源自：https://doclisboa.org/2023/en/filmes/silent-witnesses/",
