    "introduction": "A small family in Azerbaijan is on the brink of running its course. Son Machmud feverishly seeks a home of his own; mother Fidan wants her life back after years of service to the family; father Samir just wants to be left alone. Three free spirits orbiting each other, ignoring the annoyances as much as possible. However, a dramatic incident during a trip to the beach painfully highlights the hairline fractures in their existence.Azerbaijan-born director Elmar Imanov lives and studied filmmaking in Germany and his debut opens with a brief homage: a melancholy cover of Nena's 99 Red Balloons. Imanov uses this family as an astute metaphor for what happens when freedom becomes the only goal, but then serves as cover for alienation and mutual incomprehension. The film masterfully navigates between the three characters and portrays them as complete strangers and inseparable 'partners in crime' at once.",
