    "introduction": "This movie depicts with precision and through great cinematography the reality of the Colombian conflict. Both for the curious foreigner and the local inhabitant this is a movie hard to forget. The acting is surprisingly good and the story is story that some families really face nowadays in the Colombian countryside. I though it was really interesting the manner in which the conflict was portrayed, showing the complexities of a hard reality of misery and despair. The movie explores the sad subject of the displaced peasants who have to leave their houses in search of a better environment in the city. The movie makes us aware of this tragic reality and makes one reflect upon war, peace, life, and inexorably death.",
