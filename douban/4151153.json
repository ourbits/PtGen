    "introduction": "On October 9th, 1967, the revolutionary Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara was killed by Bolivian soldiers. \"Dí Buen Día a Papá\" is both the code phrase used to order Che's execution and the Spanish title of this fascinating film. It depicts the lives of three women from Che's death to the exhumation of his remains in 1997. Fernando Vargas' \"Say Good Morning To Dad\" consists of four short films that taken together illustrate what life is like in an unusual small town that protects a religious secret. An angel once visited the people of the town, and they have kept physical proof of the visit ever since.An engaging multi-generational tale set in the Bolvian village of Vallegrande, know as the town in which Ernesto 'Che' Guevara was killed in 1967. Di Buen Dia A Papa, the code used by the Bolivian government to dictate Guevara's execution, follows the fears and desires of three women from the village shaped by this dubious distinction. The now-lengendary photo of Guevara's powerful death face, with eyes opened, remind many of a Christ-like figure, leading the town to christen him 'El Santo Che'.Those involved in Che's murder have met with mysterious deaths, creating the myth of the 'Curse of Che'. The residents of Vallegrande must live with these painful memories but carry with them a deep concern for a better, more prosperous future.",
