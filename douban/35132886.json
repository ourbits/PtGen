    "introduction": "Americans have faced adversity before—overcoming it is baked into the nation’s DNA. Over the course of a 3-part miniseries, “America: Our Greatest Hours” draws upon 300+ years of US history, from the Mayflower, the American Civil War to September 11, to tell a relevant, emotional tale of how the US, as a nation, seized moments of crisis to create a better tomorrow.Combining dramatic live action sequences, premium documentary elements and expert interviews—the series explores the leadership and collaboration that saw our ancestors not only survive but thrive—stories of presidents, generals, explorers, visionaries and ordinary, yet extraordinary Americans.",
