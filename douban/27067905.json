    "introduction": "修建在南极布伦特冰架上的英国最尖端科学考察站哈利六号（Halley VI）遇到麻烦，巨大冰裂缝距离科考站只有6公里。本片讲述为价值近3千万英镑的哈利搬家的艰难工程。Last year, Natalie Hewit documented the British Antarctic Survey’s attempt to drag Halley VI, its 981-tonne research station, 23km to a safer location as the Brunt ice shelf it stands on begins to break up. The “beakers” – the science folk – make up a small minority of those involved – there are chefs, plumbers, carpenters and a farmer making it happen, too. But there’s a bitter twist to the tale。",
