She has two transvestite friends, one of them is Claudia, who is a teacher and has just accessed to her first employment as substitute; another is the very young and beautiful Myriam, immersed in a maelstrom of excesses linked to prostitution with police protection. Morena discovers that Ricardo, her current partner, has lied to her from the first moment, that he is married and is the father of two children, so she decides to end the relationship.—Bernardo74",
