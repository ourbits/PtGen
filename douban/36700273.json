    "introduction": "Ingrid tells the story of a prominent Dallas socialite/fashion designer in the 80s-- who dropped her life and ran off to the woods in order to pursue a personal and creative one. She has since become a total hermit and spends her time creating art out of rocks from the nearby creek. It is a never-ending project. Ingrid peels off the layers of this woman's persona, questioning what would drive a successful Texas fashion designer to leave her profession and family to immerse herself in nature and become an entirely self sufficient woman of the woods.",
