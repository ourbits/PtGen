    "introduction": "Dr. Emanuel Bronner was a master soap maker, self-proclaimed rabbi, and, allegedly, Albert Einstein's nephew. In 1947, after escaping from a mental institution, he invented the formula for \"Dr. Bronner's Magic Soap,\" a peppermint-infused, all-natural, multi-purpose liquid that can be found today in every American health food store. On each bottle of his soap, he printed an ever-evolving set of teachings he called \"The Moral ABC,\" designed, in his words, \"To unite all mankind free!\"",
