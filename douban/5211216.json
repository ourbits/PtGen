    "introduction": "Hasan, a young farmer who lives in a small village in western Turkey, asks permission to marry his lover, Ayse. Her father, the landlord of the village, decides to test Hasan's courage and manhood by sending him to the mountains in search of the \"yellow beauty.\" He must complete his task before the sun sets and carry a bag of salt on his shoulder as a symbol of his burden. Although Hasan doesn't believe in such traditions, he feels that he is obligated to prove his love for Ayse. On his journey, Hasan encounters characters that challenge him to succeed and, in the end, he learns to listen to his heart.",
