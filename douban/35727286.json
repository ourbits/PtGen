    "introduction": "Like many, throughout 2020 Chinese-born, US-based filmmaker Zhengfan Yang (Where Are You Going, IFFR 2016) looked closer at his immediate surroundings. From his apartment complex in Chicago, the filmmaker records ostensibly quotidian scenes: people walking, window cleaners, street sweepers; life viewed from inside a bubble.This seemingly safe bubble is soon overlayed by audio excerpts from local police radio. At a time when US law enforcement came under particular attack, the audio track reveals a more complex reality, without taking sides. Through the police response team radio communications, brief insights into various unconnected urban realities follow each other in quick succession: from absurd or seemingly trivial scenes, to violent eruptions. The contrasting visual and audio layers provide an exceptional personal reflection, during a simmering historical moment, in an exceptional year spent in isolation.",
