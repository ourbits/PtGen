A hundred years later Emily Somerton and her friend have a traumatic experience in the country and twenty years later Emily is plucked from working in a shoe shop by charismatic crime writer Hugo Dore, who just happens to be the current owner of Green Lanterns. Emily feels she is being taken over by Selima when death threats arrive, in her hand-writing, for Hugo's icy wife Harriet. When Harriet is murdered she identifies Emily as her killer before dying and Emily is arrested. Despite Jonathan explaining at her trial how Northcote was killed and how Emily was framed she is still found guilty. Jonathan and Emily's friend Joey, new assistant to Jonathan's boss Adam, discover that Emily is guilty - of a fatality from twenty years previously,and the real killer is exacting a personal revenge on her.",
