    "introduction": "It is springtime and the little bird is taking care of the first leaves on the tree. Then the blossoms open up one by one, and the bees coming buzzing along. Awakened by the sweet taste of nectar, the little bird follows them over the flower meadow. But the greedy fox is once again in pursuit. In previous episodes, the little bird met a lost leaf, a churlish squirrel and a farting caterpillar. Now it can enjoy the company of some new neighbours.",
