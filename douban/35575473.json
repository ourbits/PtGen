    "introduction": "They are actors, dancers or directors. They are confined, deconfined, reconfined. Together they play Phèdre by Jean Racine. This film is a real immersion in a theatrical troupe that wants to be, despite everything. Through Phèdre and her people, it is also the history of the place of Art that is questioned: what is the point of creating if it is to do so against one's artistic requirements? Out of resistance, no doubt.",
