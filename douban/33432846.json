    "introduction": "The story revolves around Bottle Mani (Sharan), a lame duck, who takes a supari to kill Neelakanta Raju (Ramakrishna), an elderly person from a royal family. He's been assigned the job by none other than the old man's three sons-in-law, who want to grab his property. Mani is assisted by his uncle (Tabla Nani) but he faces a lot of problems in the palace as the family is huge. He misses a couple of chances to kill Raju. There's a twist in the tale when the real Bottle Mani (Ravishankar) walks out of jail only to find that a fraud has usurped his identity and entered the palace. Henceforth, it's only chaos that reigns supreme.",
