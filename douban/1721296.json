Joe is ready to marry her, but she's engaged to her friend Mr. Bolton, although admits she's just marrying him for his money.Infuriated at her gold digging, Joe tears into her, before leaving to pursue Iris instead. Miss Healy follows him back to the speakeasy to tell him off, but she realizes that she has genuinely fallen in love with him. Meanwhile, Maudie Triplett (West) befriends Mrs. Jellyman and offers to hire her as a hostess in one of her elegant beauty parlors.",
