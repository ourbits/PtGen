    "introduction": "The Rub is a psychedelic retelling of Shakespeare's play from within the mind of the protagonist. The film was created with hand painted and rotted 35 mm and 16 mm celluloid strips, to create a new vision of the brooding Dane's experience.When Hamlet meets Terminator. This wonderful experimental film merges the traditions of found footage, abstraction and literary adaptation in a haunting visual and intellectual experience which requires more than one viewing.",
