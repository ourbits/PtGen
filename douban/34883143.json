    "introduction": "Marija Ujević Galetović is a woman full of contradictions. “A woman is essentially nature”, she says. But also that she doesn’t want to be judged by her sex. She was the only female professor of sculpture at the Zagreb Academy. A congenial short portrait by two young female filmmakers who, with self-reflexive wit and clever animations of the artist’s works, sketch connecting and dividing lines between the generations.",
