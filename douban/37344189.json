But the disappearance of two young lovers – Camilla and Manraj, modern-day Romeo and Juliet from seemingly distant worlds – shakes this fragile balance, setting off a chain of death, rivalry and unspoken truths.Investigating the case, with all its unexpected twists, is a talented local law enforcement agent Laura Macchi (Elena Radonicich), who has returned to her hometown to care for her elderly father, the town’s mayor. In her effort to preserve the delicate harmony between the two communities – a balance her father had built over time with great dedication – Laura will find herself digging into a murky past, uncovering disturbing secrets that implicate the entire town.",
