    "introduction": "Sleep No More is a Los Angeles neo noir crime thriller, combining indie style with literary intelligence and occasional comic desperation. Warren Emerson, once a master Shakespearian actor, is now a gambling drunk. Puck-like Samuel enchants crowds on the 3rd Street Promenade. Reciting the Shakespearian monologues his father, Warren, all but beat into him while his brother Beckett, a master pickpocket, makes his way through the unsuspecting crowd. When Warren gets in deep with a loan shark, his sons need to find a way to escape and like Samuel’s beloved comic book hero, Phantom Halo, they must break free of the mud that traps them. There is counterfeit money, a Bentley, a beautiful woman, knives, guns and an ending that is more like a Shakespearean tragedy then a film about growing up in the urban decay of Hollywood.",
