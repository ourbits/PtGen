    "introduction": "In the heart of the deep forest, a timeless battle brews between greed and preservation, capitalism and conservation. Brave officers face off against a cunning mafia in a struggle that transcends mere human conflict. But as the jungle's very soul hangs in the balance, will they stand united to protect the delicate harmony between humanity and wildlife? The Tiger (Raavsaaheb) tells the story of the man-animal conflict between tribals and the tiger from the perspectives of various uniformed and non-uniformed civilians - all fighting against a system built seamlessly to ensure that the environment will always suffer. It is also a revenge film where multiple protagonists fight for justice for a tribal girl and in the process end up uncovering a much bigger, much more sinister truth.",
