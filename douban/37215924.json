Soon, many ideas begin to emerge, but not in the way the writer expected. As the feeling of being in contact with stories (and not necessarily people) increases, he notices the mysterious appearance of pages on his desk, apparently written by the former resident of the house. That's enough to make Max raise doubts about his creativity, his sanity, and even his existence.",
