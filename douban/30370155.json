Gladys is a 32-year-old woman who lives in the poor and \"politically conflictive\" ghetto of \"La Victoria\" in Santiago, Chile, in the middle of the right-wing military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. She resides with her mother and her young daughter, and they receive a North American missionary named Samuel Thompson, 23 years old and full of dreams, who will discover the cruel reality that their new neighbours must endure. He starts registering the historical facts with his camera and the silent struggle of the people to recover democracy.",
