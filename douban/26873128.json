    "introduction": "In a time when the earth was believed to be flat and there was much to discover, young Marco Polo sets off to find his missing father, who vanished while exploring the Road to China. Accompanied by his strong, good-natured friend Luigi, the \"Chinese princess\" Shi La Won, and their tame bat Fu Fu, the brash Marco is ready to take on the world with his great curiosity, his burning thirst for knowledge...and his gift for getting into trouble. With Marco's father's journal as a guide, their wild adventure takes them through distant lands and mystical times. Along the way they learn about different people and cultures, make new friends, and work together to overcome obstacles and opponents alike. The Travels of the Young Marco Polo is an epic series about friendship, teamwork and discovery that is full of excitement and humour.",
