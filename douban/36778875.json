    "introduction": "Across time and diverse landscapes, four characters weave a web of stories that explore human resilience in the face of environmental upheaval. Marie, gripped by obsessive, heart-wrenching questions as a young mother whose child faces a dead-end future, channels her anxiety into passionate activism. Terence, a climate refugee, tells strangers his story in the hopes of finding asylum in the North. McKenzie, a state security officer, breaks the chains of the system to take control of his fate and feel alive at last. Then Kira, a soldier, deserts the army to join a nomadic tribe who are the guardians of humanistic values. Waiting for the Storms is a fable about the climate crisis that transcends artistic boundaries to spark a dialogue between our past, present and future.",
