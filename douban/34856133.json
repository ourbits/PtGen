    "introduction": "The reactionary illusions and ideals to which Evelyn Kunneckeis bound prove to be more of a reality which have to do withcriticism and consciousness than those of an emancipated pro-test songstress, who is most certainly just as much a cliche. Iimagine the film \"The scandalous Story of Evelyn Kunnecke\"in the form of a show, which can be made in Evelyn Kiin-neckes apartment. An improved secondary plot would de-velope out of eight Evelyn-Kunnecke-hit-songs as well asscenes from her life and from various stages of her career. Theactors would be friends and colleagues from her current socialcircle. Everything should be deliberate fiction - historical factis taboo. Spontaneous scenes from Evelyn's life would be re-created through discussions, parties, coincidental visitors ormemories.",
