    "introduction": "A legendary and enigmatic figure of cinema, Michael Cimino reached the Hollywood firmament at the age of 38 with \"Journey to the Edge of Hell\", before being relegated to purgatory two years later with the heartbreaking \"Heaven's Gate\". The pharaonic budget and the public and critical failure of this evocation of an America guilty of a collective original crime will deeply affect his career. In turn accused of being homophobic, fascist, Marxist and finally racist for \"The Year of the Dragon\", did Cimino really belong to his era, the 1970s and 1980s? Accompanied by the filmmaker's voice, this documentary, fueled by excerpts from his films and passionate insights, explores the complexity of the epic cinema of Michael Cimino, who died in 2016.",
