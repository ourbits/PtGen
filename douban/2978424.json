    "introduction": "经典的偶发艺术/行为艺术表演现场纪录片。Claes Oldenburg早年是偶发艺术的实践者，70年代后成为著名的现代派雕塑家、设计师和波普艺术家。《Happenings》是其早年的艺术实践之一，参与创作的还有Carolee Schneemann、Jackie Ferrara、Jean-Jacques Lebel等许多来自美法德各国的偶发艺术家。Early in 1962 Claes Oldenburg offered a remarkable series of ten 'Happenings' in a store on East Second Street in New York City. The audiences were kept small to heighten the intimacy of the experience. What is a 'Happening'? It would seem impossible to describe afterwards. Yet Raymond Saroff compressed the rich and sprawling imagery of each evening-length work to the essential matter in hand, reassembling a visual realization of what was seemingly consigned to the memories of its audience. All the characterizations, the unprepared transitions, the very personal rhythms with something of Saroff's own: the 'Happenings' impact on a sensitive eye, its reduction to a single and coherent point of view.",
