    "introduction": "The story of an outsider who spent seven years in prison for robbery. Eternal rebel, unsatisfied with the system and people around him, he wants to establish the way of his own justice. As a member of Belgrade mafia, after another unsuccessful robbery, he gets in prison again because of treason. Managing to escape, he is forced to leave the country and the only two persons who love him: his girlfriend and his mother. He goes to Italy and, after successful revenge, becomes the boss of Yugoslav mafia for the whole Italy. He has finally found his way of justice, glory and wealth, but not love. It is the only thing that awaits him in Belgrade. He has just finished his big job for Monza races with his friend. But, he won't be able to see the last lap in Monza.This is a pearl in the Serbian cinematography. The movie reveals us the spirit of Belgrade at the time entirely, allowing us to literally smell the dust of Belgrade streets, following the character of 'Urke' ex-convict trying to find peace in his life by only way he knows (same way which got him ended in prison at first). Regardless, the movie gives us a strong impression of one persons struggle to be a part of him self on his own way, which leaves us with an sensation of 'no-comment' filled with strong epic and romantic spirit to the very end of it. Music in the movie is perfectly composed and I mean every note is where it should be in order to integrate moments and atmosphere with visual impression. All in all this is a remarkable piece of work and one of Dragan Nikolic best roles.",
