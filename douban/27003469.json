    "introduction": "Alex (Frédéric Siuen), a thirty-something man of Chinese descent, lives the typical carefree life of his generation with his girlfriend Eloane (Audrey Bastien). After his brother's sudden death, he returns to his family in the Chinese area of Paris. The rites and traditions he is unable to follow reveal the full extent of his estrangement from his father's heritage (Bing Yin). Puzzled, he tries to unravel the mystery of his brother's death. Confronted to his father's silence and his devastated mother (Marianne Basler), only his cousin Lily(Xin Wang) is able to comfort him. With her help, he seeks an explanation by digging into his own family history. As we learn that Alex and his cousin are not blood-related, their relationship becomes more and more ambiguous. At the same time, the past of his family emerges and creates a lot of tension within the family. Alex tries to find out how it might be related to his brother's death. Torn between two cultures and between two love interests, for the first time, Alex must come to terms with his past and make real decisions.",
