    "introduction": "This bilingual movie (German and Korean) tackles the issue of Korean adoption children. Michael (Ill-Young Kim) is raised by his German adoption parents in a small German village. His physical appearance is Korean, for the rest he is 100% German and seems to live a happy life, he plays in a local band. His life starts falling apart when his best friend (one of the band members) moves to big city Berlin and his German parents end up in divorce. On the spur of the moment he 'borrows' his father VW and drives to Berlin to join his friend. In Berlin he starts noticing Korean restaurants and he starts to become curious about his heritage. He walks into a Korean restaurant and falls in love with the daughter of the owner. Conflicts soon arise when he tries to become her boyfriend. Michael does not understand Korean culture and - even though he is 'Korean' - he is not accepted by her family.",
