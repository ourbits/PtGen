They are scheming how to make use of the house so that they get wealthy. Salt puts forward the striking idea to take up alchemy.Comedy of adventure, satirizing the everlasting human pursuit of health, happiness and wealth in magic ways without making any efforts.There has always been sorcerers, medic asters, magicians and alchemists deftly profiting from their trade, especially in periods of social perturbations.",
