    "introduction": "A group of outsiders get together in 1974 Sydney, and RADIO BIRDMAN is born with a mission - to keep compromise from their art. Birdman are turned off and kicked out of venue after venue. Their determination to do things their own way, against the industry, is unwavering, and drives them together - they become a family as much as a band. A 'New Race' of disaffected youth gain a rallying point when Birdman start their own venue, 'The Funhouse', and release their own records. But the intensity that drives Radio Birdman causes their break up. 20 years later they reform. Have they found peace with their struggle against the industry and each other?",
