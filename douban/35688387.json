    "introduction": "In a small rural community, between the mountains and the sea, no child has been born in the last eight years. This inexplicable long run of infertility is coupled with rumours about women giving birth to animals.Lara has just discovered she’s pregnant with a calf, throwing her marriage to Marco into crisis: Marco begs her to end the pregnancy, but Lara seems unable to sever her visceral connection with the fetus and gradually decides to carve her own path forward.Marco’s brother, Vladi, and his wife, Merry, hold a special place in the community, being the parents of the last child born, 8-year-old Balthazar, though they are harbouring a secret of their own: Merry recently gave birth to a baby wolf, kept hidden away at home, putting a strain on the family. Meanwhile, Balthazar is revered and doted on by everyone as perhaps their last hope but is fated to get caught up in the adults’ world, stuck between its traditional past and uncertain future, as well as Lara’s journey.",
