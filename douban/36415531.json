    "introduction": "The Vienna music scene is full of great artists: Der Nino aus Wien, Voodoo Jürgens and EsRap, to name but a few. They are people who do not allow themselves to get sucked up by the mainstream and give themselves the space and the time that they need. This entertaining music documentary by Philipp Jedicke goes deep into the night and gives us a dazzling display of musical fireworks.源自：https://www.dokfest-muenchen.de/films/vienna-calling",
