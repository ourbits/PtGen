    "introduction": "It is a time of chaos and tyranny. The once-great nation of England is splintering and on the verge of revolution. The people need a hero to rise and fight to restore freedom from the realms oppressive rule. When the Sheriff of Nottingham's soldiers brutally attack his family, a young man named Robin vows bloody revenge on the men responsible. But this is not a war he can win alone. Advised and mentored by the reclusive mystic Merlin, Robin must recruit a team of outcasts, mavericks, and fugitive warriors. Each has a grudge to settle with the Sheriff and an extreme fighting skill to match. By working together, they lay siege to the crown's guards and unfair taxes, help the hopeless and rally the villagers for an all-out assault on the castle. When Robin is captured, it up to his friends to devise a rescue plan, giving him the opportunity he needs to exact revenge and finally lay to rest the ghosts of his past. THE SIEGE OF ROBIN HOOD takes the legend you know in an exhilarating new direction, mixing adventure, comedy and high impact action, and even a touch of romance.",
