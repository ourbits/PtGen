    "introduction": "Technologies are advancing faster than our ability to understand their consequences. Is artificial intelligence the answer to achieving virtual immortality? If you were able to create an immortal version of yourself, would you? Multiple award-winning documentary director Ann Shin talks to scientists and visionaries who foresee a “post-biological” world where humans and AI merge. Will it be an opportunity to free our minds from physical constraints? Or rather a Pandora's box of ethical repercussions? What separates us from machines when androids assume our identities? Will AI be the best, or the last thing we ever do? Our unique desire to become eternal raises fundamental questions about who we truly are and what price we're willing to pay to conquer death.",
