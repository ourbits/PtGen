    "introduction": "For decades of using ruqyah to help people, Ustadz Qodrat failed to ruqyah his son, Alif Al-Fatanah, possessed by a demon named Assuala. Looking for answers to his worries, Qodrat returns to the boarding school in the village where he studied. He finds the place is no longer what it used to be, with unexplained disturbances. Qodrat is again faced with the trauma of having to ruqyah Alif Amri, Yasmin's youngest child, whom he cannot refuse because of the similarity of his name to his late son. In a soul-crushing test, Qodrat again faces the fury of Assuala. Qodrat has to choose between obeying his anger or re-finding his faith.",
