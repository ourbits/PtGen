    "introduction": "The Who are known as one of the greatest live rock bands of all time, and the concert films presented here do nothing to dispute that claim. One is a memorable performance of their brilliant rock opera TOMMY, taped at a 1989 concert in Los Angeles's Universal Amphitheatre. The story of a deaf, dumb, and blind pinball whiz, this show featured high-caliber guest musicians like Elton John, Billy Idol, Phil Collins, Steve Winwood, and Patti LaBelle. The second film here presents a powerhouse rendition of The Who's second opus, QUADROPHENIA, the saga of a young man coming of age in the disillusioning 1960s. This footage is taken from the first production to faithfully follow Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey's original vision, which formed part of the band's 1996/1997 U.S. tour.DVD Features:3-Disc Box SetFull Frame - 1.33Audio:5.1 Surround Sound - EnglishDisc 1: TOMMY - LIVE AT UNIVERSAL AMPITHEATRE, LOS ANGELES 1989Text/Photo Galleries:Photo Gallery with Audio Commentary - 1.
