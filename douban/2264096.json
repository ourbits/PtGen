    "introduction": "Unnale Unnale is a scintillating love story for those young at heart.Starring handsome newcomer Vinay from Bangalore; and lovely newcomer Tanisha (Kajol's sister, last seen in Neal 'N' Nikki) and Sada in a new look, Unnale Unnale is a love story with a difference.Jeeva, the cinematographer-director, who was responsible for the cool, refreshing look of 12B, Ullam Ketkume and Run (in Hindi), has shot and directed this film. Jeeva says that a large portion of the movie has been shot in London and Melbourne and the movie revolves around the three important characters in the movie.Harris Jayaraj is the man behind 7 beautiful songs and the soundtrack; with Kavignar Vaali and Pa. Vijay assisting him with the lyrics.The story is about three people of completely different ideas, mindsets and ambitions and how their lives get interwoven. This is not a film with violence, blood and gore, but one that can be watched by the entire family.Oscar Films' V. Ravichandran has yet again ignored formula and has undertaken another different film.Ungalukkaaga - Unnale Unnale - let’s await a poetic love story for Valentine’s Day.",
