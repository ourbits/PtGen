    "introduction": "John cheats on Jane with Ann. He claims Jane doesn't care about love, and is wrong: in the end Jane shoots John. Rudolf Thome made his fourth short film on negative remnants of the films \"48 Hours to Acapulco\" by Klaus Lemke and \"Chronicle of Anna Magdalena Bach\" by Jean-Marie Straubs, which is equally experimental and influenced by genre cinema. It consists of intertitles, words, gestures and faces - and of a plot that is already summarised in the title.Jane shoots John. It doesn't start there. It doesn't end there. A story must have a beginning, a middle and an end. The old rule of thumb for studio producers. How time flies. 'In the twentieth century, you can only drink beer from cans. The woman in black from behind the jukebox: Jane. Jane in black in the cemetery, wiping tears from her eyes. Jane shot John because he was cheating on her with Ann. Love. Money. Death. The words between past and future, evocative. (...) Love was ... sitting in a record store listening to the Stones' new LP on headphones. 'I don't want you to sleep with Ann anymore. Nine years after \"Breathless\", fifteen years before \"System ohne Schatten\", in black and white and Ultrascope.\" (Michael Esser in: Kinemathek 66, 10/83)\"So once again (...) the women are consistent or at least pursue certain interests, be it a man or a coat, while the men let themselves drift with the flow of amenities on the relationship market.\" (Doris Kuhn: Die Stärke der Frauen, in: Formen der Liebe. Die Filme von Rudolf Thome, Marburg 2010)",
