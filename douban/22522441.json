    "introduction": "For over a century science fiction writers and readers have speculated about where humanity is heading. Now, it almost seems we're living in a world taken straight from the pages of their futuristic fantasies. Shot against the backdrop of major conventions, Finding the Future examines the phenomenon of science fiction. Through the thoughtful commentary of prominent authors and enthusiastic fans, we explore the culture of science fiction and the passion of its devotees for the genre. We also consider the effect of science fiction on society, and listen to these sci-fi aficionados as they muse upon what might lie ahead for our rapidly changing world.",
