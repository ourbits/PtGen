Shrouded in the darkness of the world, his life weaves through oneiric experiences and mystic visions; a river of oil runs before his eyes. Upon waking, the ascetic is faced with a divine revelation and sees prophecies and visions that only his heart could unveil. His last endeavor is mankind’s ultimate challenge: to vanquish the Apocalypse.",
