    "introduction": "Six men. The forest. The menace is there, somewhere. Armed, ready, looking for action, they wander, day and night, striving for a confrontation. While they are wandering the forest, one man disappears like a ghost, and the other five are getting wired. What is going on with the soldiers?Masculinity is a terrible thing to waste. That was probably the first impulse surrounding the formation of this film. Then came the idea of war, which is more interesting than war itself. For shadowing danger is also much more intriguing than the materialization of menace itself. Those were the conceptual elements of what became an abstract story of group loneliness and intimacy.",
