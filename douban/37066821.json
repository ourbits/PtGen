    "introduction": "<(Welcome to) The Planet of Orchids> is a cinematic anthology exploring the fascinating lives of orchids and their intricate relationships with neighbouring species. In this film, orchids are portrayed as indigenous beings who have thrived despite humans' indiscriminate colonization of ecosystems. Orchids take centre stage as protagonists, unfolding their unique or ordinary narratives from a plant-centred viewpoint. As such, the diverse and multidimensional dynamics of the transhuman community, which all ecosystem members belong, are revealed, and human audiences finally encounter 'Planet Orchid'.",
