It is also known that an Abwehr School has been established to train underwater saboteurs. Saburov’s task is to find Kuntz and, through him, to uncover the location of the school that needs to be destroyed.Saburov's arrival in Novorossiysk is overshadowed by a tragic event. During the seizure of enemy agents, his friend and former classmate, Yegor Soley, is killed when covering Sergey. Now the whole team looks askance at Saburov. And Yegor’s wife, Yelena, seems to hate him sincerely, despite she and Sergey having known each other since childhood, being in love with one other but concealing their feelings. In due time, it was Saburov who introduced Lena to Yegor, but fate decreed that the woman he loved became the wife of his best friend. Anyway, this difficult relationship must in no case interfere with the cause, since the fate of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet is at stake!",
