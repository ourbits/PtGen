    "introduction": "My Way begins with the conventional \"small-town girl livin' in a lonely (corporate) world.\" Yet instead of taking the midnight train, Rebekah Starr trades her pants-suit for a Les Paul, grabs her sassy Estonian tambourine-banging sidekick and hits the highway-destination: Sunset Strip. When Rebekah's marriage falls apart in real time, we realize her dream is not a whim. It is a burning passion for music that comes with its share of real world sacrifices. Thanks to the support from her newfound rock n roll legend friends such as Steven Adler (Guns n Roses) and Rikki Rocket (Poison), Starr re-commits to her mission and accomplishes what she set out to do. Her contagious optimism acts as the film's through line, hoping to inspire anyone feeling trapped by their circumstances.",
