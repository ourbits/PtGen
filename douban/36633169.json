    "introduction": "The narrative, set in 1547, centres on Petr Pětipeský, a young, orphaned knight who becomes the custodian of the picturesque village of Urbach, nestled beneath the towering Fichtelberg mountain. His duty to construct a bridge to the adjacent mineral-rich forest transforms into an epic adventure as he encounters a series of supernatural events. With villagers mysteriously disappearing and graves being exhumed, rumours of a diabolical curse begin to spread across the valley. The tale takes a personal turn for Petr when his beloved Alma goes missing, pulling him into the depths of a dark plot masterminded by the villainous Moro.",
