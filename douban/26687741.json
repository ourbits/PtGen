    "introduction": "Dong-min rejects the idea of following in his father's footsteps and take over the successful family corportation. Instead he runs away to Whale Island to be a writer. There he meets Sang-il who resembles him very closely. Because he has been out of the country for the last 15 years, Dong-min believes it is possible for Sang-il to take his place without even his family suspecting. Everything seems to go well at first, until Sang-il starts to fall in love with Dong-min's sister",
