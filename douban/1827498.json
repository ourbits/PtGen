    "introduction": "When Keaton is rejected by his girl friend, he sets out in a small boat seeking forgetfulness. His troubles increase, however, when he takes refuge on a whaling ship. He quickly incurs the wrath of the despotic ship's captain. Making his escape, Buster next encounters a large flotation device which he does not recognize as a target for nautical maneuvers. It is blown to smithereens and Buster wakes up from a dream. We realize the whole story has been a dream. And Buster, to his consternation, discovers his own small boat has never left the dock.Color: Black and WhiteSound Mix: Silent",
