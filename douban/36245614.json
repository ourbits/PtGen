    "introduction": "A remote hill in the Mexican countryside is said to be a site where at least one group of Chinese and other Asian migrants died whilst fleeing a wave of violence following the Mexican Revolution. Over a century later, there appears to be nothing left on the site by way of commemoration and historical records are scant. Khoshnoudi’s film is a project to document the hill in question and in doing so, to turn the landscape into a monument of sorts to the violence it has witnessed. Shot on 16mm film that was hand-developed with plants, salt and earth taken from the site, the film becomes a material, as well as cinematic, trace of this spectral tragedy that has left none of its own.源自：https://opencitylondon.com/events/combined-programme-extended-presences/",
