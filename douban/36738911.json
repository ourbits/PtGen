Sixteen digital artists were granted access to a pre-programmed cube template, that occludes their 3D digital artworks, & enables the curation of the visible art on each side. Within theseparameters, artists crafted captivating visions exploring themes of time, perspective, and juxtaposition. They wove a visual narrative compelling the audience to explore, compare, and rotate the cube, discovering new viewpoints & analyzing adjacent world relationships.",
