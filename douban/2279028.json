    "introduction": "VERY COOL的东欧超现实电影。The seventies were a period in which the filming of literary works became widespread. These were mainly adaptations of the classics from Slovenian literature. There were, however, two noteworthy exceptions, one based on a childrenâ€™s book and another on a contemporary novel. Sreca na vrvici (Hang On, Doggy), a childrenâ€™s comedy about the restrictions of life in urban surroundings, was very popular. To so gadi (Real Pests), a farcical comedy set in a suburban environment, was released at around the same time and went on to become one of biggest hits.The next decade brought very few hits to the cinema, with some notable exceptions like the grotesque fantasy-comedy about the struggle for the power called Butnskala (Bumpstone) made by Franci Slak. While in this movie the terror of totalitarianism was still allegorical, it became much more concrete in the movie Hudodelci (The Felons).",
