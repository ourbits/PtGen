    "introduction": "Critically acclaimed director Vadim Abdrashitov once again uses a screenplay by Alexander Mindadze for this social drama in which Soviet youths are depicted as sullen and disrespectful to authority. Viktor Belov is a factory worker who is attacked by two teenage thugs. One youth is given probation, but Vladimir is sentenced to two years in prison. Viktor is troubled by the trial and the jailing of his young assailant and visits him in prison. Filmed in 1980, the feature was not released until 1988 and was reviewed at the Toronto Film Festival. ~ Dan Pavlides, All Movie Guide",
