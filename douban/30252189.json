    "introduction": "She (Donaire) belongs to one of the most important dynasties of carnival queens in Down Street, and he (Esplendor) is the only son of the most influential queen in Up Street. In the best style of Romeo and Juliet a war that started when both their mothers were queens is revived by the new love born between them. Every year, both streets invest 360 days preparing to beat their rival at the Porras Park, the epicenter where year after year they release an arsenal of feathers, Swarovski crystals, music groups, tunes and floats that show, in the five days that the carnival lasts, all the strength, power and tradition of each street. At the center of the action of this fun series are Vanesa Espino (queen mother of Up Street), her brother Pocho and their minions, Bertilda, Pepo and Caco; as well as Analia de Díaz (queen mother of Down Street), Masiel Vásquez (queen grandmother of Down Street) and Donaire's sisters, Alegría and Dinastia. The actions of each of these characters are the triggers that fuel the flame of old passions, hatreds and endless fun situations.",
