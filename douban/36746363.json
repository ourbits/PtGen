    "introduction": "Gino goes on an odyssey, both on land and in the depths of the sea, to discover his homeland's true hidden gems as he explores the well kept food secrets of Italy's deep South in Puglia and Basilicata. The series will see Gino explore a romantic realm: full of rugged mountains, ancient cave cities, beaches, and clear turquoise waters. The southern heel and sole of the country is Italy at its most epic! These regions are a melting pot of secrets; with much of their culinary fare influenced by former occupiers, ranging from the Ancient Greeks to the Byzantines and Spanish, who all left their mark on the modern day dishes and traditions found in Italy's deep south.",
