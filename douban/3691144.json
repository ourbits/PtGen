    "introduction": "Armando Bo seems to be the Latin American equivalent of Tinto Brass, combining experimental cinema with erotica. Isabel Sarli would have surely played in Russ Meyer's breast fetishism films.In 1968 and 1969, the duo [Isabel Sarli and Armando Bo] gets their best (something like Sgt. pepper era for the Beatles) and produced their three masterpieces: \"Carne\", \"Fuego\" y \"Fiebre\", three films that are unique in the world, three films that influenced John Waters big time and were a clear precedent to his revolutionary work, three film that are, to me, the closer that Argentinian cinema got to a national cinema style, but in Argentina Bo was forbidden and imprisoned many times for obscenity. \"Fiebre\" is an amazing piece of experimental film-making. The idea is \"Isabel (or her character, its the same) falls in love with a horse.\"",
