    "introduction": "‘Starving artists', fragile beings who clearly sensed they were of no use to society and tried to make it anyway. When things got going again in August 2020, after months of lockdown and seclusion, they were the only ones who couldn't go back to business as usual. Over a year and a half, in and out of lockdowns, the director shares his daily life, entwined with that of a set designer out of work, a musician with no gigs, and a farmer turned poet. Survivors, in a word, who just needed a good idea to stop treading water, and this is how they became the Seafarers.",
