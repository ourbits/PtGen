    "introduction": "Daniel, a young man serving time in a Spanish prison for abetting a crime. A bad cop, Guillermo, visits the prisoner because he knows of Daniel's role in the murder. At the same time, Guillermo, who is gay, seems to develop an attraction to Daniel, but will never tell him how he feels about him. Guillermo urges Daniel to eliminate a night club owner, Salgado, who is also in jail. Daniel has no choice but to do what Guillermo proposes in order to save his own skin.Daniel, whose ambition is to be a boxer, goes to see a trainer after he gets out. This man, who is reluctant to work with a criminal, makes a bargain to coach him for one last fight when Daniel tells him he has been wrongly accused. Daniel who watches Salgado's funeral from a distance, is seen following his widow, Raquel. She is a former hooker but is no fool, likes what she sees in the ex con. What he didn't know is that he is about to fall in love with her.The police, who are following Raquel, tie Daniel to her, thinking she will implicate the young man in her husband's death. The rest of the story is complicated as others get in the scene and Daniel goes to win big on his first fight. Ultimately, Daniel becomes the target that must be eliminated.\"La distancia\" is one of the better films that have come out of Spain in recent memory. Thanks to director Inaki Dorronsoro, who also wrote the screen play, the movie combines a couple of genres to make a satisfying product. Mr. Dorronsoro got excellent performances from his cast, especially by Miguel Angel Silvestre and Jose Coronado. Both these actors involve the viewer making their characters seem real. One disappointment is Federico Luppi, an otherwise fine actor that has nothing to do in the picture. Lluis Homar, another good player has some good moments.Director Dorronsoro is a director well worth to watch in future ventures.",
