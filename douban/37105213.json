    "introduction": "The Insider Series 2: Reggie Yates - A Week in a Toxic Waste Dump The Insider sees Reggie Yates live life for real inside some of the world's most brutal institutions. Documentary in which Reggie Yates heads to Ghana to live on one of the largest electronic waste dumps in the world - Accra's Agbogbloshie. Working with a group of 'burner boys', the people grafting at what is considered to be the bottom of the ladder, Reggie discovers first-hand what life is like for the people who eke out a living on the site. Dumping electronic waste is illegal, and the chemicals in the soil in Agbogbloshie mean it has been described as 'the most toxic place on earth'.",
