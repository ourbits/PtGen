    "introduction": "The Nazis are losing the war. As his regime crumbles, the once indomitable Fuhrer hides in a bunker while those around him plot their escape. After suffering huge losses in battle and surviving an assassination attempt, Hitler can only drive Germany further into the abyss. Tired and defeated, he clings desperately to power, surrounded by those who appear fiercely loyal but in reality are undermining each other and plotting their own escapes. One by one, their individual delusions seal their fates - only a scant few will survive to face justice. This series takes a forensic look at Hitler's final desperate days and tries to explain the choices he made as the inevitable end drew near.Episode 1 | Who Will Betray Him?1/3 Hitler’s pursuit of total war plays out as a psychological drama within his inner circle.Episode 2 | Hitler's Birthday2/3 At the end of March 1945, Nazi Germany is on the brink of collapse.Episode 3 | Into the Abyss3/3 With most of Germany occupied by invading Allied forces, the Nazi regime disintegrates.",
