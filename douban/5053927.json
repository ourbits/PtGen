    "introduction": "1964 in Berlin, not long after the raise of the wall that separated the city: ex-prisoner Bruno is chosen by the eastern secret agency to be sent west with a special order. However as soon as he's crossed the border, he reports to the police. He claims his order was to kidnap someone, but he doesn't know who yet. He's forced to continue feignedly. However the east agents don't really trust him and play a double game... Written by Tom ZoernerThis is the movie Roland Klick made after Supermarkt (1974). You can call it a german mainstream movie in the same way as Fassbinder´s Lilli Marleen is a kind of mainstream movie, since both were made as an order form big production companies. However, Klick wrote also the screenplay himself from a book by the German bestselling author Johannes Mario Simmel and the author himself was very pleased with Klicks script and wanted only him to direct the movie. Bernd Eichinger bought the rights to do a movie and with the support of Klick rescued the former production company from going bankrupt.Many so called \"Simmel movies\" were made in Germany in the 70´s and 80´s and today, Klick´s movie stands out as being probably the best. Some critics in 1976 even thought that Klick´s script was better than the original novel. The movie most certainly shows Klick´s craftmanship as a director as well as a playwright.In 1982 Fassbinder had plans to shoot another Simmel novel: \"Hurra, wir leben noch\", but his untimely death did prevent this plan.",
