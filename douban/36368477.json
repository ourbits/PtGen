    "introduction": "Do not adjust your receivers. The characters in Crocodile, which premiered at Cannes, really communicate primarily through screams. The language of shouting, however, turns out to be surprisingly rich and depending on the situation can signify an outburst of anger, a testament to powerlessness, a cry for help, and sometimes all of these at once.
