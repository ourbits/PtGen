    "introduction": "Dog Eat Dog is a short film based on the true story of how actor/producer Zachary Quinto finally adopted his first dog in a Los Angeles Animal Shelter. During the events of his hilarious trials in attempting to adopt a shelter animal, Sian Heder, the film’s director was apparently there with him and taking notes about the whole thing to make a good dinner party story. After the story was told many times, it eventually evolved into the script. The film is described as “a twisted, fun, morality tale about the lengths to which some of us will go in order to get what we want.”",
