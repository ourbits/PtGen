Herself (voice)Plot / SynopsisWhen Böddi returns to his home village, in the North of Iceland, after 10 years of academic life in Germany he sets out to change the mindset of the local people. Through his blog he preaches highbrow ideals mixed with Viking Era romanticism which both amuses and confuses the locals. The students he teaches at the local high school think he's crazy and finally Böddi gets fired. The girl he is in love with rejects him and the one he’s using as a distraction ends up using him. Being a man of ideals, Böddi continues his poetic crusade but with limited success. When it finally dawns on him that nothing will ever change in the village, he gets on his sturdy horse, Nietzsche, and rides south, to the big city of Reykjavík. He’s got a gun in his pocket and noble ideas for the people. He’s ready for his revolution. And this revolution is quite real.Homepage:http://rokland.is",
