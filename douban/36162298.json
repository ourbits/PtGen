    "introduction": "n a last-minute dash across town, Alfons just barely manages to catch the bus for his class trip to the Baltic Sea. Things worsen when he discovers that his suitcase has been mixed up with that of his mother. But the crowning disaster comes in a desperate attempt to impress his new classmate Leonie. Alfons decides to run for class president. Unfortunately for him, his arch-enemy Nico immediately realizes what he is up to and challenges him to a stupid bet. The fun continues and Alfons‘ fate as an eternal jinx takes its usual course! Flying macaroni with tomato sauce, a teacher who would love to send him home, exciting nights around the campfire and a dangerous climbing tour turn the class trip into one that Alfons and his friends will never forget.源自：https://poff.ee/en/film/alfons-jitterbit-class-trip-chaos/",
