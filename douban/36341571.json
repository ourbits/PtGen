    "introduction": "The series brings forward the invisible struggles that Chinese Canadian immigrant families face while trying to make a home in the West. With nods to Asian cinema films like Edward Yang’s “Yi Yi” and BBC drama “I May Destroy You,” “Streams Flow From a River” revolves around the Chow family, who dreamed of owning land and placed their bets on a laundromat in the tiny rural town of Frank, Alberta. When a freak snowstorm traps the dysfunctional family together in their hometown, they are forced to confront events from a decade ago that tore them all apart.",
