    "introduction": "One of my most favorite latino movies! The Pacific War (1879-1883) put the Chileans against the allied of Peru and Bolivia. Nowadays, this subject still divides our countries. \"Caliche Sangriento\" shows us the adventure of a group of Chilean soldiers lost in the Atacama's desert. During this journey, the Captain (Duvauchelle) and the Lieutenant (Vadell) argue about the real reasons who led Chile into the war. It was not homeland's defense, but economical interest. This point of view made quite an impression in Chile, and this movie was intended to be forbidden. More than a war movie, this is more like a western one. We have desert, great spaces, tough guys, honour conflict and some bullets. \"Caliche Sangriento\" is one of the best Chilean films.",
