The women arriving at the mansion have a lifetime of experience, living through love, loss and laughter, hoping for a spark that ignites a future full of endless possibilities. In the end, will our Golden man turn the page to start a new chapter with the woman of his dreams?”“The Golden Bachelor,” which will air Mondays this fall at 10 p.m., is produced by Warner Bros.
