    "introduction": "The 13-year-old Zoro is full of energy and ideas. Usually when he needs money. And he's not afraid to go up against the law to get it. Because Zoro has a dream: There is nothing he wants more that to unite his family once again. After fleeing Afghanistan, Zoro arrived in the southern German town of Liebigheim with his mother and sisters, but his father was left stranded in Hungary. When Zoro learns that the Christian boys' choir led by the iron-handed chorus mistress Miss Lehmann is travelling to Hungary for a choral competition, Zoro makes up his mind to learn to sing. What began for Zoro as a plan to finally bring his father to Germany turns into a deeply personal passion. Miss Lehmann's initial prejudices against the refugee boy dissipate and she develops a heartfelt affection. Meanwhile, Zoro finds a true friend in the shy choirboy Julian. But before long, reality closes in on Zoro and he must fight once again - this time for his new homeland.",
