    "introduction": "Historical documentary series challenging what we think we know about the end of Pompeii. Presented by Bettany Hughes, Raksha Dave and John Sergeant. For centuries, a third of the Roman city had been left untouched. This meant that hundreds of shops, homes, streets and bodies laid unseen beneath ash and rubble for 2000 years exactly as they were on the day of the eruption.",
