    "introduction": "Recorded with a swallowed pill camera, the video Un gif larguísimo (A Very Long Gif) is an observational journey through the landscape of the digestive system, combined with a detailed zoom into cities and people moving in the limits of our vision, filmed with a powerful telephoto lens. These disparate image spaces sustain each other with the tension of celestial bodies. The sound of overlapping movements through different human agglomerations offers a third level of observation. Scales are flipped and imperceptible movements are unveiled in the longest GIF you’ve ever seen.源自：https://www.berlinale.de/en/2023/programme/202309945.html",
