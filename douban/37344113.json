    "introduction": "A young filmmaker, Vala, is editing a documentary about an Icelandic female writer Ragnheiður Jónsdóttir who died in 1967. Vala is obsessed with her books and dreams about making a TV series from her most famous books about Þóra. In her mind she pictures several scenes about Þóra and her unhappy relationship with her husband. These scenes come alive and Vala herself plays the role of Þóra. There is a dialogue on different levels between today and the past where Vala confronts the writer who litterally comes alive in the editing suite. Vala wants to throw light on the situation of women in Iceland between 1920 and 1960 and to do so, she uses Ragnheiður's books and archive material.",
