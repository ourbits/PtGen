    "introduction": "This documentary follows thrill-seeking, fun-loving, Michael Warkentin on yet another trip of a lifetime. Three decades ago, Michael woke up to a new reality after enduring a tragic accident. Determined to make the most out of life, he has set out to take many incredible adventures not only to experience the world for himself, but to show others what's possible. Sitting on a wheelchair has not slowed him down. We followed Michael through Spain, Italy, France and London. During this Mediterranean cruise, among gorgeous European landmarks, the film explores the 6 phases of recovery that we all go through after facing adversity. Michael is an excellent testament of recuperation and over-achievement. He teaches us with humor the real value of life.",
