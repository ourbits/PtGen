    "introduction": "When the daughter of a Cambridge professor is brutally killed while out jogging, Lynley and Havers are assigned to the case. The young woman was deaf and on the evidence, it appears the attack was deliberate. There are any number of suspects: the girl's father is divorced, re-married to a much younger woman who suspects him of having an affair; another Cambridge professor known for being a bit too friendly with students and against whom she was about to make a formal sexual harassment complaint; her ex-boyfriend, with whom she had recently broken up; a student advisor who was very attracted to her, but in whom she had little interest. While in Cambridge, Lynley takes the opportunity to get in touch with Helen Clyde who is staying locally with her sister. At home, Havers continues to deal with the effects of her mother's Alzheimer's disease and the need to provide ever more care.",
