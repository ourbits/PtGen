Stella, after fifty years of marriage, notices she has given up on dreams to be the woman behind a \"great man\" and for motherhood. In an act of courage, she decides to get a divorce. Her daughter Lívia is a famous psychologist that, to try to make her jealous and manipulative husband happy, gives up on great opportunities. Cléo is a survivor who struggles against adversities imposed by her social life and does everything to maintain her mother's happiness. Searching for their freedom, their dilemmas and relationships cross paths throughout the story, making each one of them reinvent themselves and discover their overcoming skills, learning that it is never too late to have control over their own lives.",
