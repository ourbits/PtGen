    "introduction": "Lovely piece of Kyrgyz poetic realism about a shepherd working in the mountains, herding sheep, talking with his family.The creation of a national cinema in Kyrgyzstan is customarily attributed to Bolotbek Shamshiev, Tolomush Okeev and Melis Ubekeyev whose protagonists are common men with everyday joys and sorrows. But the most important force behind Kyrgyz cinema is a writer and philosopher, Chingiz Aitmatov. He served as the president of the Union of Filmmakers for many years. Many of his books are made into films and he often collaborates in the writing of the scripts.",
