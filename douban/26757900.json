    "introduction": "两兄弟在被流放80年后从哈萨克斯坦回到了故土波兰，为的就是重新立足。但面临的性格差异却不容忽视。其中一个是理想主义的画家，而另一个是实用主义的工程师。他们虽水火不容，却也本是同根生。命运对他们并不是很友好，存放着所有画作的房子被烧毁、一人将另一人送去了养老院...与时间的赛跑已开始，他们能顺利完成吗？\tAfter 80 years of exile two brothers come back to Poland from Kazakhstan. The aim is to set their place in the new world. They face obstacles of character differences. One of them is a painter and a dreamer, the other one – a pragmatic engineer.  They are as different as ink and water and as inseparable as a flower from its stem. They want to rebuild their lives in spite of dramatic events that the fate sends down on them when their house, with several thousands of paintings, burns down and when one brother has put the other brother in the center for elderly people; the race against time begins now. Will they be fast enough?",
