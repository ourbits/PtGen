    "introduction": "The women who married Henry VIII have become definednot by the way they lived but by the way their lives ended.They are seen as victims of a bloated tyrant, deserving pity, but notrespect. However, have we under-estimated them and are historians right tohave merely portrayed them as bit-part players in Henry's story?Using dramatic reconstruction and passionate narration,eminent historian and presenter Dr David Starkey focuseson the stories of the women themselves, revealing inintimate detail their experiences of sex, childbirth and the glamorous,dangerous life at court, including the deadly intrigues that dethronedthem.",
