    "introduction": "Charlie Brooker attempts to explain where it all went wrong and just how wildly the TV and movie ideal differs from life's grim realityEver wondered why life doesn't measure up to those youthful lofty expectations?From love and money to fear and progress, Charlie Brooker explores a different universal theme each week as this six-part series attempts to explain where it all went wrong and just how wildly the TV and movie ideal differs from life's grim reality.Marking the point where the mad daydreams of TV and the sorry reality of real life collide, the series employs a mixture of archive footage, sketches and interviews that will have you wiping away tears of laughter while nodding in recognition, which means you'll probably have your eye out if you're not careful.How TV Ruined Your Life features performances from a collection of comedians and actors including Kevin Eldon, Beth Cordingly, Belinda Stewart-Wilson, Liz May Brice, James Holmes, Gemma Arrowsmith, Helen Fospero, Stuart Laing, Chris Hayward, Lucy Thackeray and Thaila Zucchi.",
