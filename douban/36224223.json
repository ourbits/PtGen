Once 18, Ella leaves and ends up in Lier, where Dr. Norbert is running a private clinic owned by recluse Nicolas De Prins's family. Intrigues abound long before Ella meets and recognizes either relative, her mysterious dad or Jens, who ends up comatose after chasing her. Meanwhile Ella made new friends and moved in with a loony hairdresser and her gay deputy Anthony.",
