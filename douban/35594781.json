    "introduction": "They call it the Devil's Cave because according to legend, many people have entered and have not been seen again. Some attribute it to murderers hiding inside, others to alien beings and a few to the results of paranormal phenomena. The place is part of the 200 caves that have been detected in the Cerro de la Estrella, in Iztapalapa, where the representation of the Passion of Christ concludes annually. Filmmaker Julio César Estrada found the video shot by a young man trying to make a documentary about his missing friends.",
