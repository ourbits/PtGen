    "introduction": "The film is a homage to Delphine Seyrig and her fascination for the book Calamity Jane’s Letters to her Daughter. Those letters are from a mother to an absent daughter which became a feminist landmark in the late 1970 and the source for Seyrig’s film project about Calamity Jane’s sensibility and insight about life. The reading of those letters to a daughter who doesn't receive them as they are not sent permits a self-reflection about feminism and motherhood and is a homage to Seyrig's creativity and a long-term commitment among women in the 21st century to share other women stories.",
