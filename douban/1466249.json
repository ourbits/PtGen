    "introduction": "Wenders' first full-length film was produced as his graduation project at the Academy of Film and Television in Munich (\"Hochschule für Fernsehen und Film München\") which he attended from 1967 to 1970. Shot in 16 mm black and white by subsequent long-time Wenders collaborator Robby Müller, the movie exhibited many of Wenders' later trademark themes of aimless searching, running from invisible demons, and persistent wandering toward an indeterminate goal. In this case the journey is that of protagonist Hans (Zischler) after he is released from prison. Searching through seedy West German streets and bars, he finally winds up visiting an old friend in Berlin.",
