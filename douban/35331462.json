    "introduction": "The story, described as “ten interwoven love stories of gods, titans, nuns, madmen, Americans and suicidal girls, set in the wildest corners of the Aegean Sea”, reflects both a lament for lost purity, and an examination of the islands' complex blend of paganism and Christianity. This dichotomy serves as a fertile ground for exploring mythological themes, intertwining tales of gods and titans with the lives of the characters in a way that offers new perspectives on ancient myths. At the heart of My Soul Startled, which covers the period between the 1930s and the early 1990s, lie the works of writer Yiannis Kl Zervos, which have served as a foundation for the film's story while paying homage to a voice from the past, bringing forgotten tales to the forefront of modern Greek cinema.",
