    "introduction": "Carol Bailey is buckling under the weight of financial pressure, family responsibilities and his own ambition and desires. After endless parties, too many dead end jobs and family arguments, Bailey becomes Self-Destructive. Resorting to violence and severing all ties of friendship and love, Bailey enters a world where his friends are unable to follow. After a self-imposed exile Bailey returns to London to apologise, things have changed. Not everyone is sympathetic to his sudden re-appearance and there are others who will stop at nothing to make Bailey's life a living hell. Faced with a relationship lost amongst affluence and drug fueled parties, Bailey must accept his own limitations and confront the demons of his past.",
