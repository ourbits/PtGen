    "introduction": "Based on the screenplay by Mario Von Czapiewski (Cannibal Diner), Rootwood follows two students who host \"The Spooky Hour,\" a podcast about paranormal phenomena and urban legends. When they are hired by Hollywood film producer Laura Benott to shoot a horror documentary about the curse of The Wooden Devil, they smell their chance to become famous. Together, with their friend Erin, they enter Rootwood Forest and investigate the area to find out the truth about The Wooden Devil and his victims. Elissa Dowling (Tales of Halloween), Tyler Gallant (Alpha Wolf), Sarah French (Ouija House), Felissa Rose (Sleepaway Camp), Brandon Rhea (Ultimate Justice) and Tiffani Fest (Serena Waits) star in a film that combines the aesthetics of ghost films and the intensity of monster movies to create a unique horror experience with surprising twists and turns.",
