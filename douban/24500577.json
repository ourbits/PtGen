Carl is happily-married, Sally's engaged - where's the harm? Yet they find themselves increasingly drawn to each other, and as their friendship grows to flirtation they refuse to admit - to each other or themselves - that a line might be crossed. The consequences of discovery will be life-changing, catastrophic perhaps, and yet they can't help falling in love. A romantic drama for grown-ups, The 7.39 will be charged, funny, moving and sexy.",
