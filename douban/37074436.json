    "introduction": "Lucky (Terry Chen) once had a streak of fortune as wide as the sky. A tattooed former gambler, he has since settled down with a mortgage, wife, and two daughters. But it’s winter in Calgary and, with his family to look after and a fledgling electronics repair shop incurring numerous bills, he’s feeling under pressure from all sides. When he falls for a tax scam, Lucky scrambles to recover his losses and goes all in at the card table, risking his livelihood and marriage in the process. Meanwhile, his wife Noel (Oliva Cheng) and eldest daughter Grace (Conni Miu) face their own moral dilemmas…A vibrant and essential addition to Asian-Canadian film, Lucky Star is a complex examination of a Chinese-Canadian family at a crossroads. Director Gillian McKercher helms a tense and gripping narrative about familial bonds, deceit, and sacrifice, exploring the crucial choices a person can make to change their life, for the better – or for worse.",
