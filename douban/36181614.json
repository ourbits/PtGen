    "introduction": "The movie spins a melodramatic tale of longing, friendship, and birth and death of love. Love dies often. People often die for love and die with their beloved. Yet love is essential for the circle of life to keep turning! A stray dog gives birth to the main character, Poop, on a marvellous spring day. The young Poop befriends a Sparrow, who educates him in ways of life. Observing loving sparrow family’s ventures from his shanty throughout autumn and winter, a desire for a beloved arises in Poop’s chest. Along with spring, Poop discovers a glorious Buttercup growing right next to his shanty. Poop proposes in the same breath, and Miss Buttercup is only happy to accept. This seemingly simple story carries with it many themes, from environment preservation to acceptance of diverse looks and sentiments.",
