    "introduction": "Set in 1939, during World War II, when the Japanese Empire sent troops to Siam (Thailand) as part of their greater plan; the story depicts the star-crossed romance between Kobori, an Imperial Japanese Navy officer and Angsumalin, a proud and patriotic Thai woman. She had just promised Wanat that she will give him an answer to his marriage proposal after he returns from England, where he went to join the Free Thai resistance movement.  Kobori, an idealistic soldier with a sensitive and artistic soul, had just set up camp among the ship yards of the Chaophraya River, near Angsumalin‘s house. Kobori falls in love with Angsumalin, who he names Hideko, at first sight. However, she sees him as part of the occupying forces of her country and naturally despises him. Despite his duty, Kobori wants to believe that his love will be able to find its way into her heart.",
