    "introduction": "In 2000, \"Baby Blues\" was adapted into an animated cartoon series which aired on The WB Television Network for a few weeks in the summer, from July 28, 2000 to August 25, 2000. The animated version featured Darryl and Wanda raising the infant Zoe as their first child, as distinct from the comic strip's storyline of the time which showed Zoe as the older sister to Hammie. Mike O'Malley supplied the voice of Darryl while Julia Sweeney played Wanda.The Baby Blues television series differed from the comic strip by focusing on Darryl and Wanda's relationship with the Bittermans, a neighbor family with three children (Rodney, Megan, and Shelby); Kenny, Darryl's co-worker; and Bizzy, the babysitter for Zoe. Rick Kirkman and Jerry Scott had little creative control over the animated version. [2]The WB typically aired two episodes each week, thus enabling eight different episodes to be shown in the five-week run, but abandoned plans to air additional episodes which had been completed. Previously unaired episodes were later shown by the Cartoon Network in its Adult Swim block.The Theme Song was \"It's All Been Done\" by the Barenaked Ladies.",
