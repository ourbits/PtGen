    "introduction": "What makes a place inspire an artist and an artist inspire a place? The new documentary series \"Geografia da Arte\" investigates the intricate relationships between artists and places in different eras. Featuring the experiences of names like Henri Cartier-Bresson, Donald Judd, Keith Haring, Georgia O'Keeffe and others, the series shows how these artists were profoundly touched by locations that they visited or moved to - and also how they ended up influencing that place through their work. Shot over a period of one year in countries like Japan, Morocco, Iceland, France, India and the United States, the series features stunning imagery and a comprehensive survey of some of the world's most prominent artists. Each episode is dedicated to one artist and a specific location that has inspired his/her work in a specific moment in their career. The series premieres with an episode dedicated to Donald Judd's relationship with the town of Marfa, in Texas, where he set up a base in the 1970's. The love affair between Georgia O'Keeffe and New Mexico, her home for over 60 years, is also featured in the series. Following episodes focus on French designer Yves Saint Laurent's connection with Morocco; Japanese architect Tadao Ando with the island of Naoshima; Choreographer Pina Bausch and New York City; Keith Haring and Brazil; and Ragnar Kjartansson and Iceland. Created by Award-winning directors Tatiana Issa and Guto Barra, \"Geografia da Arte\" premiered at the prestigious channel Arte 1, in Brazil.",
