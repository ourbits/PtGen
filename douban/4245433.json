    "introduction": "This Peter Carter's first feature film, with the veteran producer, F.R. Crawley, and the result is a sharply observed study of the simple life in the Newfoundland and its people. The script was written by a well-known Canadian actor, Gordon Pinsent, who himself is a Newfoundlander. Gordon Pinsent wanted to see more of Canada on the screen than just Montreal and Toronto. He wrote this screenplay about a forthright, boisterous, independent, fun-loving rascal who finds himself alone in society, with his own life and that of Newfoundland in mind. There are many marvellous moments, notably the scene between Pinsent and Will Geer, and whole has a charm and energy which carries it over less articulated sequences.",
