    "introduction": "Keep in mind this film has nothing whatsoever to do with Oliver Stone. Instead we have a twenty something man with little or no ambition who happens to enjoy smoking the cheeba.He has to do the odd job for his father's car detailing business in which he successfully screws up constantly. He seems to even have issues with handing out fliers! The crux of the story has him picking up a 55 Mercury from a customer to go detail it but somehow gets it stolen while partaking in some ice cream and some puffs. He then spends the duration of the film looking for the car while getting high and falling in love.This is a \"PG\"ish comedy with no nudity but does contain the odd f bomb and rampant use of marijuana(the whole city seems to get high).Teenagers will enjoy the humour but probably no one else will. It is a light no brainer comedy which actually does emit a few morals. After watching the film you will probably want to get high if you already aren't.",
