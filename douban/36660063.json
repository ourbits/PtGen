    "introduction": "尤里是一位65岁的鳏夫。自从他的妻子17年前去世以来，他一直执着地在他人身上审视那些会让他想起妻子的细节。在他的雕塑工作室里，他一直努力着重塑她。他只缺一个关键的元素，那就是眼睛。后来他遇到了安德烈亚斯（24岁）：显然他有她的眼睛。尤里将被这次相遇颠覆，无论是在人际关系上还是在它所代表的意义上：这是他追寻的终点。Yuri is a 65-year-old widower. Since the death of his wife, 17 years ago, he obsessively scrutinizes in the others details which would remind him of her. In his sculptor's workshop, he has been working hard to re-fabricate her. He misses only one key element, the eyes. When he meets Andreas (24 years), it is an evidence obvious : he has his eyes. Yuri will be turned upside down by this meeting, both humanly and for what it represents: the end of his quest.",
