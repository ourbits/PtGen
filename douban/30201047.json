    "introduction": "The summer has just begun and new summer guests Carsten and Celia Larsson have invited the entire island to a summer party to unveil their newly built luxury home in Fyrudden. But not everyone is looking forward to the party. The large construction project has invited the ire of many of the island's residents, who are far from pleased with their new neighbors. Carsten receives anonymous threats, and has also alienated the construction workers by falling behind on his payments. An uninvited guest shows up just in time for the party, as well. Nora is more neutral to the island's newcomers and both she and Jonas are excited to go to the party. A party that will end in catastrophe.",
