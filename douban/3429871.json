    "introduction": "本纪录片对很多专业人士作了专访，对于9/11事件的很多疑问作了深入的探讨，对于美国政府的失职，对民众的隐瞒，和不法行为有着相当细致的分析。包括布什政府如何利用9/11事件，绕过国会和执法机构实现了部分独裁。AfterMath delves into the troubling span of issues that have arisen since the attacks on 9/11, including the negligence of military officials in reacting to the hijackings, proven links between the hijackers, Pakistani intelligence (ISI) and the CIA, the role of oil in the Eurasian conflict, and the impact of post-911 legislation on American civil liberties. The film poses questions that continue to overshadow and critically challenge the administration's official version of the story, and is a must see for those who continue to question the terrible and as yet unexplained events of that day.",
