    "introduction": "GET YER YA-YA’S OUT! is a chronicle of The Rolling Stones’ epic performance at Madison Square Garden in November 1969. Albert and David Maysles famously documented the Rolling Stones’ 1969 U.S. tour in the feature documentary Gimme Shelter, released in 1970. Now, Albert Maysles has put together never-before seen archive footage that shows the band — Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Charlie Watts, Mick Taylor and Bill Wyman — at its apogee, wowing New York audiences at Madison Square Garden over the Thanksgiving weekend of that year. Beyond the full-length performances of five Stones songs — presented in surround sound — the film includes a cover shoot, rare backstage footage, a mixing session and more. “27 minutes of pure pleasure. An intoxicating snapshot of the Rolling Stones’ 1969 tour, this irresistible time capsule captures the band before they were a brand, and includes glimpses of Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix.” – Manohla Dargis, The New York Times",
