    "introduction": "When Ione, director of the film, moves into the home of the late García siblings, she discovers that their lives remain latent in the objects they left behind. A piano, hundreds of drawings, thousands of pictures, or loads of tapes, allow her to portray the characters of the film. Antonio worked as a comic artist for the Bruguera publishing house, Rosita was an opera singer and a pianist. Along with their brother Juanito, they transformed their home into a space for creation and fiction as an escape from the dark reality of the Franco dictatorship. Inside the walls of their home, the García siblings became classic film stars, World War II soldiers, gangsters, astronauts, sci-fi heroines, lonely cowboys on an eternal journey to the west... Their memory houses the history of the XX century. Years later, with new inhabitants, their home is still a place where life can be something else.",
