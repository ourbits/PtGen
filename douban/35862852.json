    "introduction": "VAN GAAL: THE MAN BEHIND THE LEGEND paints a unique portrait of the Dutch national team coach Louis van Gaal. He previously coached FC Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Ajax, AZ and Manchester United and is perhaps one of the best football coaches in the world. He is also a man about whom everyone has an opinion and his usually controversial statements often attract a lot of attention. The documentary  follows Van Gaal over a period of three years and captures him in both public and private moments. In conversations with football stars such as Wayne Rooney, Luís Figo, Xavi and Arjen Robben, but also with his wife and daughters, a complete picture of Van Gaal's unprecedented international career and the extraordinary man behind the much-discussed image is created.",
