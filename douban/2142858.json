    "introduction": "\"Le train en marche\", gives us an intimate insight of Medvedkin's experience with the CineTrain in Russia during the 1930's. Marker achieves once more to delight the audience of this short documentary through a delicate selection of pictures, music and contents. It is mentioned in the movie that of all arts, cinema is the most important. Even though this claiming may be questionable it is undoubtedly that cinema can be much more than a simple element of entertainment becoming an effective tool of education when in the right hands. The movie also refreshingly reminds us of how youth and romanticism can act as the main strength for those who believe that a different/better world is possible.",
