They soon find a new leader in the charismatic Father Franciszek, who shows them a new definition of God. Mother Superior and Father Franciszek begin to preach that not only the soul, but also the body should experience the Lord... Soon the monastery is surrounded by barbed wire - no one can leave or enter. What happens behind these closed doors is a secret that only the sisters and Father Franciszek share. But Anna, one of the sisters, is not entirely convinced about the new form of their faith. Alone and torn, she will have to fight a ruthless battle for the purity of her soul. And her body.",
