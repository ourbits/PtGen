When he discovers that his mother and father have learning disabilities and never knew they had a child, his world is blown apart.For Joe and his wife, Cath (Emma Cunniffe), it's the beginning of a rollercoaster journey which challenges not only his preconceptions about disability, but also his sense of identity.Writer Peter Bowker spent 12 years as a special needs teacher before becoming a full-time writer. His writing credits include Undercover Heart (nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Drama Series) and Blackpool.\"In Flesh and Blood I wanted to explore what it feels like to believe that you've got no history, that your history starts with you,\" he says. \"How would it affect you, how far would it throw you?\"",
