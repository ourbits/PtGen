    "introduction": "艾娃似乎有点恍惚，几乎不知道她周围发生了什么。在公共汽车上，她慢慢地开始向家乡走去。她的哥哥和几个朋友还在那里，她只想在熟悉的环境中呆一两天。晚上，她在篝火旁喝醉了酒，她的哥哥艾萨克不得不把她放在床上，她来探望的真正原因就不言而喻了。Ava seems to be in something of a trance, barely registering what is happening around her. On the bus she slowly starts coming to as she makes her way towards her home town. Her brother and a few friends are still living there; she just wants to spend one or two days in familiar surroundings. After she gets drunk in the evening around a campfire and her brother Isaac has to put her to bed, the true reason for her visit comes spilling out.",
