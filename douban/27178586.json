    "introduction": "Marte and Jaeho are the same age but are from different countries and of opposite genders. They exchange letters about their daily lives. Jaeho visits home after a long stay abroad and records the everyday life of his family, while Marte captures her routine with her children in Norway. They also share memories of their mothers, who permeate their daily routine. The calming quality of the rhythm of daily life slips into the film, as does the cinematic time and recollections of their mothers. In that sense, this film is as much about mothers and their daily lives in which they are reflected. Marte’s story begins with the death of her mother and Jaeho faces his mother’s death. Marte becomes a better mother to her own daughter and, as a son, Jaeho belatedly ruminates over his mother’s life. Taking the form of a correspondence, a diary, and at the same time as an aside to the audience, and the film conveys with a casual touch the personal reflections of two directors. (LEE Seung-min)",
