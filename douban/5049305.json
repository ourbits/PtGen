    "introduction": "Years ahead of its time, Stanislav Stanojevic's Camera Award-winning political drama comprises eight individual stories of human rights violations occurring simultaneously in Prague, Munich, Paris, Vienna, Geneva, Montevideo, Zaire, and France over the course of November 10, 1983. Stanojevic sets these fictional stories of unfortunate individuals, whose only crime is existing, in settings where such violations actually occurred. Notorious Nobodies, or Illustres Inconnus, wrote filmmaker Costa-Gavras, \"attempts to describe for us the struggle of men and women around the world to save what is most precious to them: their dignity...neither a plea nor a denunciation but rather an original cinema of exceptional quality, a tragedy about human destiny.\" (Facets)",
