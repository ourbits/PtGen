    "introduction": "The Way We Get By by Aron Gaudet (2009, 84 min.). A seemingly idiosyncratic story about \"troop greeters\"—senior citizens who gather daily at a small airport to thank American soldiers departing and returning from Iraq—the film quickly turns into an unsettling and compassionate story about aging, war, and morality. When the three greeters aren't at the airport, they wrestle with their own problems: failing health, depression, and mounting debt. Seeking telling details rather than sweeping generalizations, the film carefully builds stories of heartbreak and redemption.",
