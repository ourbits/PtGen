The Mexican bakery has held a warm spot in her heart ever since she worked there as a teenager alongside her high school crush, Alejandro \"Alex\" Casillas, the handsome nephew of the owner. When Alex's uncle asks for Maya's help in selling the bakery, Alex decides to return home to celebrate one last Christmas in the bakery and help Maya find a buyer for the bakery, whether or not she actually wants his help.",
