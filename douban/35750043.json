    "introduction": "\"The Auschwitz Album\" is the only known surviving photographic evidence recording the arrival, selection and imprisonment of Hungarian Jews deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. In it are pictures of George Brent and his father. In early summer 1944, at the height of the frenzied deportation of Hungarian Jewry, fourteen-year-old George Brent, his parents, and ten-year-old brother arrived at the notorious Auschwitz-Birkenau killing center. Immediately separated, George never saw his mother and brother again. The last words his father spoke to him at Auschwitz were, \"Don’t forget me. \"",
