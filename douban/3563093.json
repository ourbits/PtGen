Choir members, roughly eight to thirteen years old, practice and perform while a young singer narrates the history of the tradition.Scenes from Bastien und Bastienne, Le duo des chats and more are included. Impressively filmed and full of great music. A definite must for any lover of boy choirs and boy soloists; also bound to be enjoyed by anyone who simply appreciates the arts.",
