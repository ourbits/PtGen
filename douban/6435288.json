They were both part of the workshop's creation and of a very recognized and conflict magazine which one generated therapeutic, institutional and social effects that proved to be too much for it. The words heard through the phone the day before make them need to find out what happened to Martin and his body. While discussing about this very same subject a word makes them remember about the beginnings of the workshop.",
