    "introduction": "It's not a GREAT movie, but a good one nonetheless. Perfect for a relaxing weekend, with your partner or your best gal pals.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, the plot was well-thought through and put together, unlike some romantic comedies which are utterly ridiculous and in which nothing gels.\r\n\r\nThe lead characters are extremely likable, especially Olly (Stuart Townsend) and Murray (Seth Green). You totally understand why Sarah (Amy Smart) would fall in love with him. He has his quirks (total klutz and a sorta \"born-loser\") but he has a really good heart. Murray is the best friend whom everyone should want to have. Someone who would do anything to make sure that his best friend gets what he rightly deserves.\r\n\r\nOne of those movies which gets you to believe in the traditional notions of love once again. To be faithful and truthful to the one you love, and to be willing to do anything to make him/her happy. And also, that being in love brings out the best in a person.",
