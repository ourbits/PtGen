    "introduction": "Adolfo Bioy Casares + Jorge Luis Borges !!!a lost classic!A plot is hatched to stage a coup. Don Aliceo Rojas, an upstanding man, is killled because of his involvment in the plot. His daughter, Elena, witnesses his murder and realizes that one of the killers was her former lover. She resolves to ensure justice on her father's behalf. But justice is complicated, and she discovers her ex-lover's motives were not what she had expected.The temptation of dwelling more deeply into the cinematographic world took him to creating two scripts, Los orilleros and El paraíso de los creyentes, both in collaboration with the talented Adolfo Bioy Casares, scripts which were edited in 1955. The first was adapted and filmed by Ricardo Luna in 1975, the other text remains inedited in cinema. Los orilleros is a gray and forgettable film, like many of the adaptations that have been done of his work.",
