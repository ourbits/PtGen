    "introduction": "Alex(Francois·Goske) is a teenager whose life is thrown into turmoil following the announcement that his father’s new girlfriend is pregnant and his mother intends to move to England with her new partner and himself in tow.Summertime Blues chronicles Alex’s exile to a sleepy English village and his determination to return to his home-town of Bremen at the earliest opportunity. It’s not long, however, before he begins to make friends, notably Louie and Faye(Sarah·Beck), who show him that life in the middle of nowhere isn’t all that bad. At a crossroads, Alex is torn between his life in Bremen and his new life in England.In the height of summer 2008, Kent played host to the German production Summertime Blues. Looking for some of Kent’s most idyllic and romantic countryside locations, the crew came to the Film Office to aid them in their search. After weeks of deliberation the production company chose the beautiful market town of Faversham and the picturesque village of Stodmarsh for Alex’s quintessentially English home.PLUS：Released in Germany this summer, there are unfortunately no current plans to bring the film to the UK！",
