    "introduction": "Lina Berglund is 15 years old, and she's sick of being invisible and un-kissed. If you take her word for it, she's more not than hot.Her pals are a different story: Thea is good-looking and irritatingly popular while Carro is a nutty extrovert. Lina's somewhere in-between, only kind of less of everything. In the name of friendship, she does Thea's homework and inherits her cast-off clothes. She also envies Carro's daringness and disregard for convention. Their hierarchy is etched in stone, and everything goes smoothly as long as they all play their parts. Lina might even be the glue that keeps the trio together, but she feels more like a doormat. This semester, their last before moving on to high school, is going to be different. Lina's decided it's time to live it up.",
