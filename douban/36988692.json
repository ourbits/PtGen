    "introduction": "Dallas, 2019 is an intimate, experiential and observational five-part series that studies and reveals how citizens are socialized, shaped and formed within a society. Filmed in pre-pandemic Dallas, Texas, the series follows the lives of public representatives — a Dallas County Court Commissioner, the Dallas City Manager, the DISD Superintendent and Dallas County Sheriff, the Chief Medical Examiner, the Dallas County District Attorney and the Dallas County Director of Health and Human Services, among others — and the varied constituents they represent. This screening will feature episodes two, three and four of the series, with a short intermission after episode three.",
