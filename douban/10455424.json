    "introduction": "Delmira Agustini (Uruguay, 1886-1914) is considered one of the greatest female poets in Latin America. Filmmaker Laurent provides a beautiful, calm and sometimes playful portrait of her brief life. Agustini had two passions: love and poetry.Tragic artists’ lives are always a thankful subject for films. Certainly if they end the same way as Shakespeare’s Romeo & Juliet. In this subtle, super-cooled biography, the French director/scriptwriter/actress Christine Laurent filmed the life of Delmira Agustini (1886-1914), a famous name within female poetry in Latin America. As a member of the Uruguayan aristocratic class, Agustini lived her short life in luxurious mansions, stylishly depicted by Laurent. Here she had all the room she needed to write her titillating, erotic poems.Laurent focuses primarily on the fickle love life on which Agustini's work was based. Her relationship with the possessive Enrique Job Reyes had its ups and downs. He wants to marry her, but she has her doubts and also has to come to terms with her dominant mother. Spoken in French, Demain? turns into a portrait of a young woman who, despite growing up in relative freedom, has to fight for her independence.",
