She wants his body - which is how he ends up as a catwalk model at her fashion show, leading to an embarrassing encounter with his parents,who,thanks to his efforts to impress Gracja,take him to be a heroin addict. Just as disastrous is his stint as a dog walker for a befuddled old lady. When her dog is apparently killed in his care he buys a replacement,only for the original pooch to inevitably come home.",
