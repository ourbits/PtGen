    "introduction": "In the mid 1970's, a visionary leader decades ahead of his time is locked in a struggle for the future of America. His name is Jimmy Carter. In their feature film debut, CARTERLAND, the Pattiz Brothers examine the tragic, yet inspiring story of America's most misunderstood president. While leading the nation through a series of unprecedented crises, Jimmy Carter also confronted climate change and championed social justice at home and abroad. This groundbreaking film draws on archival footage, experts, and insiders to reveal how Carter's selfless leadership and moral integrity ultimately cost him the presidency.",
