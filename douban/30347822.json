    "introduction": "Two years after Yamato (California), the Japanese director is back with a Singaporean jaunt that’s a cross between a guided tour and a surreal music video. Featuring a heroine who loses her friend and her phone in the vast city, the film uses an array of styles to convey with aplomb and self-assurance our age of incessant communication. Miyasaki devotes lavish attention to filming Singapore’s cityscapes. Aided by actress Nina Endo, who also appeared in his previous film, and a soundtrack by The Are and Lil’Yukichi, the filmmaker delivers an offbeat account of a young woman’s strange journey.",
