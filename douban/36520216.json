    "introduction": "In April 2009, Václav Havel suggested to director Petr Jančárek to ‘film the rest of his life’.Their almost three-year-long collaboration, which ended with Havel's death, was characterized by complete openness, the ex-president's trust in the director and the creator's responsibility towards his protagonist. Feature documentary Havel Speaking, Can You Hear Me? is crafted from unique footage, treading the non-existent line between the private and public personas of this global figure.",
