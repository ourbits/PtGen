    "introduction": "Marcin Kluczykowski's documentary plays like science fiction or a road movie, following an infant on a dangerous journey from the living room to the garden. According to the rules of the genre, the protagonist experiences many adventures during this time, reacting alternately with euphoria and fear, but above all with an unmolested curiosity about the unknown. By the way, it inspires us to embark on our own journey, allowing us to think back to a time when we were still capable of wonder at the world.",
