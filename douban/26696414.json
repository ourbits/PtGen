    "introduction": "It is no wonder that we are mesmerized by mountains, are afraid of them and are obsessed by them. They evoke wildness in all of us, and yet still they remain a world of secrets.With one programme each on the Rocky Mountains, the Andes and Himalaya, this series will use drones to reveal these mountains as never before. The audience will be taken from hidden valleys to unknown peaks and they will feel the vertigo, cold and sense of wonder that these great ranges evoke.This landmark three-part series on the iconic ranges of the world will show how the mountains mould the lives of the extraordinary animals and the remote peoples that live there and how these great ranges create weather systems that rule our planet.",
