    "introduction": "A coming of age romance for anyone who's ever had a crush. Since high school, Stan and Jenny have had crushes on each other. They wrote letters to one another over school holidays but in person they barely spoke; sharing only the occasional lingering glance and smile. Over the years they fantasized about how perfect they would be as lovers. Ten years later they bump into each other and have the chance to make it a reality but it's not that simple; self doubt, fear of rejection, of losing their fantasies will hold them back from what could be the perfect union",
