    "introduction": "After spending her youthful energy servicing the ummah and the pious she’s taught to revere since childhood, a string of losses and betrayals pushed Kiran to the brink. Disillusioned, she reclaimed back her mind and body from the faith for her own use—and abuse, in an act of utter defiance. All is seeming well for Kiran if not for the fact that her act of rebellion was strangely not satisfying enough. So she decided to step up the game, plunging her deeper into danger, that would either drive her into a kind of wisdom, or into a bottomless abyss.源自：https://jaff-filmfest.org/harlots-prayer/",
