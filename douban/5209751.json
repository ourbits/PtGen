Carl is on a mission for equal rights for all vampire-kind, and a camera crew catches him on his 15 minutes of fame. We peek inside the life of Mr. Weber, his rocky friendship with his two best friends Cassie and Toby, his dysfunctional family, his bewildered employer, his quirky lawyer and a dancing cat.",
