    "introduction": "Summer 2018 and the world is shaken by 2 dramatic volcanic eruptions: Kilauea in Hawaii and Fuego in Guatemala.Both unleash terror but in very different ways.  Through unique and exclusive eyewitness footage and first-hand accounts this documentary special compares events as they unfold day by day. Using the latest science we investigate why the volcanoes were so different and why the scale of the eruptions and the ensuing disasters  were so hard to predict.Narrator: Josh Cowdery, Jorge Felizardo",
