    "introduction": "Passionate love and complicated emotions arise as monogamy is put to the test in this romantic indie comedy about love’s unpredictable paths.Jane lives a structured life as a travel agent, selling adventures to others while remaining stuck in the safety of her own routine. She shares her life with Mikki, a struggling actor, and although the passion between them has faded, she is caught off guard when Mikki suggests they explore other sexual connections. After an encounter at a trendy, sex-positive nightclub, Jane’s horizons suddenly expand, and the idea of an open relationship no longer seems so daunting. But with new connections come unexpected emotions, and breaking free from binding conventions proves to be far more complicated than expected. Paula Korva’s charming dramedy sparks with energy, exploring freedom, desire, and the challenges that arise when the heart decides to follow its own path.",
