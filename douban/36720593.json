    "introduction": "Lapsed Mormon Geoff Pingree retraces the steps he took twenty-five years ago in Guatemala as devout missionary 'Elder Pingree'. Combining archival material and contemporary footage as it moves from jungle village to national capital, THE RETURN OF ELDER PINGREE pairs the young Elder Pingree's earlier, single-minded journey with the older Geoff Pingree's ambivalent return to Guatemala now as he seeks to discover what has become of the Guatemalans who once trusted him with their religious faith, attempts to understand the violent and unsettling political conditions of which he was ignorant as a regimented missionary, and grapples with the basic human dilemma of how one can and ought to do good in the world.",
