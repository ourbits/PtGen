    "introduction": "纪念智利新歌运动的旗手VICTOR JARA逝世25周年所拍摄的纪录片。The documentary features extensive interviews, television footage and never before seen fotos. Victor Jara was a dangerous singer to the forces of facisism in Chile and his songs live on today in the hearts of those who seek justice and peace in the world. This dvd takes you into not only Victor's life, but into Chile's history during a very turbulent period when the US helped Pinochet come to power and commit terrible human rights abuses, of which Victor was a victim. Any student of Spanish or Latin American history should own this!!",
