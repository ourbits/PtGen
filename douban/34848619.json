Set against the context of massive media interest and a growing global following, Krishnan explores both the real and surreal worlds of the Gorillaz - the 'lives' of the animated band members and their creators. It is a blend of drama, documentary and animation, with humour being the key to the programme. Written by Dazed Film & TV",
