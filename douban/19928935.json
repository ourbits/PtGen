    "introduction": "At the tender age of 14, Sonja Henie became Norwegian skating champion and went on to capture Olympic gold one year later in 1928, a record-setting victory that launched her career into the stratosphere as she captured the hearts of millions in Hollywood films, beginning with her star turn in \"One in a Million.\" This documentary explores Henie's richly colorful life and times. Narrated by Cliff Robertson.Sonja Henie (1912-1969) was a Norwegian figure skater and film star. She was a three-time Olympic Champion (1928, 1932, 1936) in Ladies Singles, a ten-time World Champion (1927ΓÇô1936) and a six-time European Champion (1931ΓÇô1936). She introduced short skirts, white skates, and flirtatious moves into figure skating. Her spectacular spins and jumps raised the bar for all competitors. Henie won more Olympic and World titles than any other female figure skater. At the height of her acting career she was one of the highest paid stars in Hollywood. Today, she can still be admired through the lavish Henie-Onstad centre for modern art outside Oslo, also containing her huge trophy collection.",
