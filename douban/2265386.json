    "introduction": "还记得Grindhouse的中间插播的trailer么，这个B movie就是其中的一个。 sonychen 注It's the 1980's and a group of teenagers are getting together to hold a séance in a haunted house. All the typical 80's horror movie characters are there: the cool hero, the innocent girlfriend, the goth chick, the tough guy, the beautiful blonde girl, the shy guy in love with the beautiful blonde girl, a couple of lipstick lesbians and two big geeks. In true low budget 80's horror movie fashion, weird things start happening around the house. One dimensional characters are dying preposterously bloody deaths, girls are getting naked for no apparent reason and people walk into dangerous, pitch black rooms saying classic lines like, \"Is someone in here?\" As the poor, hapless kids are sliced and diced, it's up to our hero to lead the remaining survivors to safety before the house is filled with stupid dead teenagers.
