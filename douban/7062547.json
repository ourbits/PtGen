    "introduction": "Forty years ago, broadcasting legend Bernard Braden recorded more than 350 interviews with the most iconic and recognised faces of the 1960s from the worlds of show business, film, politics and sport. Viewers will have unique access to the extraordinary, revealing portraits of iconic 60s names, such as Cilla Black, Robert Maxwell, Lulu, Enoch Powell, Quentin Crisp and Sean Connery. The programmes will re-interview some of those originally filmed to reveal what the 60s meant to them and examine what has really changed socially, politically and culturally in the intervening 40 years.blue’s telecine and restoration department was asked by the BFI to archive more than 350 interviews shot by Braden from 1967 to 1968 and donated to the BFI. The 16mm film and ¼-inch tape are being transferred to HD for the BFI’s archive and 70 interviews have been transferred to digibeta for Silver River Productions. The transfer work started in August 2008 and is due to be completed in January 2009.“We’re transferring the films at a rate of about 20-30 interviews a week,” said Martin Rogers, at blue’s telecine and restoration department. “It’s turned from a routine transfer/archiving job into a full post-production project. It’s very exciting as these interviews have never been seen before and feature names such as Tom Jones, Sammy Davis Jnr, Ronnie Scott, Quincy Jones, Spike Milligan, Vanessa Redgrave – the list is endless.”'Sex Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll: The 60's Unseen' was graded by Graeme Hayes, onlined by Alex Pickering and sound mixed by Kevin Boyle at blue post production.",
