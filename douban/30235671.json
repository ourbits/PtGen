This stunning documentary reveals the remarkable story a theatrical genius who showed the world just how far we can dream if we have courage to reach for it. On stage, Geraldine's complex characterizations set a new standard of excellence that inspired an entire generation.

Geraldine ignited hope in everyone who has ever wished for something bigger, something better. For the first time, this legend is brought to life, illuminating the authenticity and ambition of an actress who refused to succumb to limitations and proved that true originals don't conform to expectations. They change them. Forever.",
