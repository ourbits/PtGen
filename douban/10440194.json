    "introduction": "Base is a 60-year-old Kurdish woman living alone in a small town close to Maras where an inhuman massacre had taken place in 1978. Being a part of the slaughtered minority of the town and having survived it, her husband has left the country after the event to work in Saudi Arabia. During the time he was abroad, he was sending audiotapes to his family instead of letters, because his wife and two sons were illiterate. They were responding the same way. The voices have become the strongest tie between them. He has died in a job accident. Having a vague memory of these tapes, Base's younger son, Zeynel, is now looking for them. Finding them will bring back their painful yet willfully forgotten past",
