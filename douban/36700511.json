    "introduction": "The chemistry that shaped our planet is the very chemistry that shaped us – and all life on earth – from the giant blue whale to the tiniest single celled organism. Surprisingly, out of all the chemical elements on the periodic table, just six – Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorous and Sulphur – combine to make up everything we know; from the planets in our solar system to the invisible bacteria and viruses of the microbial world, and everything in-between – plants, animals, and of course, us.In three captivating and informative hours, The Chemistry of Life uncovers the story of the breakthroughs that have enabled us to understand how life began, how it evolved, what maintains it, how we’ve used our knowledge of chemistry to enhance our lives, and what puts it all at risk.E1.
