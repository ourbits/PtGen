    "introduction": "Film is a typical David Dhawan Film.The actors who are in form here are Rishi Kapoor and Salman Khan - Who play a father and son role. Their interaction and chemistry is the high point of the film. Salman Khan(son) comes to London to find his father(Rishi) and when they meet, Rishi's character tries to get rid of him as he fears his family will disown him as he was engaged at the time when he his son was born(salman). What follows is a cat and mouse game where the son threatens to reveal all with hilarious consequences. The songs are alright. Typical choreography of a David Dhawan presentation. Amisha Patel has a nothing role in the film and there is a short cameo role for Sanjay Dutt.",
