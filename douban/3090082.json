    "introduction": "已故法国摄影大师Dominique Chapuis（1948-2001）为苏联纪录片导演罗曼-卡门制作的纪录片，以罗曼-卡门的大量摄影照片和黑白纪录片段为原始素材。Dominique曾是戈达尔后期作品的摄影师，还拍过不少Jacques Rivette的实验东东和Claude Lanzmann的纪录片《Shoah》。Roman Lazarevich Karmen (16 November 1906 Odessa – 28 April 1978 Moscow) was a Soviet General, a war camera-man and film director and one of the most influential figures in documentary film making; he could be considered USSR's answer to Leni Riefenstahl.Karmen was a true believer in Communism, and roamed the world portraying the Spanish Civil War, the battles for Moscow and Leningrad in World War II, the First Indochina War, and the rise of Communism in South East Asia in the 50's and in South America during the 60's.Karmen was also granted personal access to the emergence of Communist leaders China's Mao Tse-Tung, Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh, Cuba's Fidel Castro and Chile's Salvador Allende.Karmen's documentary methods were both influential and controversial, his renowned technical ability captured the emotion of war and the repetition of key shots and framings between film projects became a hallmark, but he would often blur the lines of Cinéma vérité by restaging key battles, including the liberation of Leningrad (1942) and the siege of Dien Bien Phu (1955), and reconstructing the 1956 landing in Cuba of revolutionaries led by Fidel Castro as a first person documentary.In 2001, French documentary directors Dominique Chapuis and Patrick Barbéris produced a 90mn investigation about Karmen, titled \"Roman Karmen, A Cineast In The Revolution's Service\". The following year Barbéris (his co-author Chapuis passed by in late 2001) published a critical portrait \"Roman Karmen, A Red Legend\".",
