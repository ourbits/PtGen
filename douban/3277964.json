    "introduction": "Filmed over the course of 23 years, The Betrayal is the extraordinary story of a family’s journey from war-torn Laos to the mean streets of New York. During the Vietnam War, the United States government clandestinely operated in the neighboring country of Laos – recruiting Laotians for CIA-backed missions. When the U.S. withdrew, the new Communist regime sought vengeance. Thousands were imprisoned or killed. One family, the Phrasavaths, made the courageous decision to escape to America. Epic in scope yet devastatingly intimate, renowned cinematographer Ellen Kuras’ directorial debut is a collaboration with the film’s subject and co-director Thavisouk Phrasavath. Featuring a score by Academy Award winning composer Howard Shore, The Betrayal is an astonishing tale of survival and a testament to the resilient bonds of family.\"",
