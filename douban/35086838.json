First there is a power outage, then her grandmother reveals her most well kept secret: she is a cannibal all along, and tonight she is having her grand daughter for dinner. Chased by a maniacal cannibal in her own territory, there is seemingly no escape for Wing Sum. She is however miraculously rescued by the queerest turn of events.",
