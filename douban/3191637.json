    "introduction": "07年奥斯卡外语片单元阿塞拜疆官方参赛影片，这也是阿塞拜疆历史上首次参加奥斯卡最佳外语片的角逐。低成本小制作的火车爱情片，不过可以看到不少高加索地区的美景。After her husband's death, a widow returns to Moscow with her mother-in-law, unaware that a depressed passenger is determined to blow up the train en route. In October 2007, the film was chosen by Azerbaijan to be the first-ever Azeri film to compete for the Best Foreign Language Film Award at the Oscars.Azerbaijan has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, with the first submission made in 2007. The Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film is handed out annually by the United States Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to a feature-length motion picture produced outside the United States that contains primarily non-English dialogue. It was not created until the 1956 Academy Awards, in which a competitive Academy Award of Merit, known as the Best Foreign Language Film Award, was created for non-English speaking films, and has been given annually since. As of 2008, one Albanian film, Caucasia, has been submitted for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but was not accepted as a nominee.",
