The café was once a home to artists and intellectuals, now it is a haven for oddballs and outcasts including: a violent Arab painter fresh out of an insane asylum, an alcoholic mama’s boy who stutters, a macho heartbroken musician and an outcast Belgian immigrant photographer. The landlord puts the squeeze on Leah and threatens to demolish the building. Through a bizarre chain of events, Yutz and his friends band together to save the café and in turn save themselves. An off beat comedy about people struggling to maintain their sanity in an insane reality",
