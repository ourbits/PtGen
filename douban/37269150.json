    "introduction": "There has been an eleven month freeze in Emily and Sam's relationship, ever since last Christmas as Sam didn't feel like he could trust her, especially with Violet, without Emily answering questions about her past, questions she didn't feel like she could answer for him. With the Christmas season approaching again, Violet, unaware of the issue between her father and Emily, meiju.ｐro  is hinting that she'd like her old job at the Mistletoe back. Emily feels compelled unofficially to look into the \"disappearance\" of someone important in Violet's life, her English teacher, Tim Henley, the double quotes as he is not officially missing in having abruptly submitted his resignation to deal with a personal issue. He became an even more integrated part of her life as he was the coach of the school's chess club, its star player, Kyle Granger, on who Violet has been crushing and who Mr. Henley had asked Violet to tutor in he failing English, a failing grade which would preclude him from being on the chess team and thwart his chances of receiving a scholarship. But as Emily investigates and believes foul play has indeed occurred, she has to convince Sam of Tim truly having disappeared, before she can insert herself into an official investigation.",
