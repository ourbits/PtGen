    "introduction": "The merger between cinematic language and traditional African narrative forms is taken even further in Jom, the Story of a People (Senegal 1982) by Ababacar Samb Makharam. The film presents an epic overview of the history of Senegal within the structure of a tale told by a griot. Griots are the itinerant poets and musicians of Senegal who has the responsibility of recounting and maintaining the history of a tribe or people and, because of their duty in preserving the memories of their people, the griots hold an especially important place within the West African cultural community. The role of the griot was, perhaps, best stated by Sembene: \"His work reflects and synthesizes the problems, the struggles, and the hopes of his people,\" In Jom, the Story of a People, Makharam's creates the film equivalent of a griot's tale with all of its musical and moral strengths intact.",
