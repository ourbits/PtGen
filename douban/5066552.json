    "introduction": "UPA had just taken over the cartoon production for Columbia and their influence shows vividly on this Fox-and-Crow entry that lets the slapstick be a result of a 'human-nature' story. The Fox and Crow have a band-act in a nightclub, but the Fox walks out on his partner when he gets the position of a symphony-orchestra conductor. The Fox becomes while his old partner is on skid row, cold and hungry. One night, the Crow appears backstage at the concert Hall and hands a magician's wand to the Fox as he goes onstage. Using the wand as a baton, everything that can go wrong goes wrong for the snooty maestro, and the audience begins to boo. Crow then makes his stage entry and saves the day with his one-man band routine.",
