Thinking her dog had bitten her, she sets out to find traces of it, despite the persistence of her best friend to just let it go. Confused and distraught about her body and what the blood entails, she tries to make sense of herself and her tireless longing. She digs deep into her own flowery crevices to understand-- clawing and howling.",
