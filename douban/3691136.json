    "introduction": "Pablo César is an Argentinean filmmaker. He started shooting cinema when he was 13 years old after his older brother José María, who was also a filmmaker, gave him an Super 8MM camera and taught him about the arts and techniques of making movies (only 4 years later José tragicaly passed away leaving behind him a very shocking filmography).Pablo shot twenty short films and two long feature films in Super 8mm which are called \"From the faces of the mirror\" and \"Diary of a madman\". Later he shot seven long feature films in 35mm: \"The holy family\" (1988), \"Equinox (the garden of the roses)\" (1991), \"Grey fire\" (1993), \"Unicorn (the garden of the fruits)\" (1996), \"Aphrodite (the garden of the perfumes)\" (1998), \"Blood\" (2003) and \"Hunabkú\" (2007). He has been constantly recognized for his particular vision and his daring narration skills.He is an international pioneer in developping co-productions between his home country, Argentina, and India, Tunisia and Mali. Along with those countries he dedicated many years to shoot a very particular trilogy inspired in old Sufi poems and some ancient mythologic texts. All of his films have been awarded at different festivals all around the world. He has also taken part at juries of International Film Festivals such as Amiens (France), Montréal (Canada, Film Festival for Young People), Kelibia (Tunisia), Huy (Belgium), Hyderabad (India), Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), Villa Carlos Paz and Buenos Aires (Argentina). He has been teaching movie direction, production and his seminar of author's cinema at the University of Cinema in Buenos Aires since 1992.",
