    "introduction": "At the end of his rope, a newly redundant office drone (Nathanael Chadwick, THE LAST PORNO SHOW) takes a rideshare driver job, but the gig isn’t making ends meet, and he’s missing bill payments, avoiding calls from his landlord, and not spending time with his partner and new baby. Days of frustrating bookings, from bickering couples to puking party girls, reach a boiling point. When a slick passenger tells him about a new, well-paying driving gig at a company called Tonomo, our driver makes the call and starts immediately to cash in. This new job comes with rules, however—obey the app’s instructions, don’t talk to passengers, and finish the ride, or he’ll lose all his money. He soon learns that these are hard and fast rules and that he’s at the mercy of the app and its mysterious, often psycho customers, both of which will put him in situations that test his conscience and morals. – Carolyn Mauricette",
