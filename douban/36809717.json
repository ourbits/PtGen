    "introduction": "Men and women board a mysterious train that takes them to a suspension bridge between heaven and earth. Some of them try to understand why they are here, others talk about their hopes and fears; earthly memories sometimes surface. Each person experiences in his or her own way this threshold state on the edge of a dream, as if in a rite of passage. Everyone is on their way to a mysterious goal – the presumed end of the bridge – but does it really exist?",
