    "introduction": "现在我明白了，恐龙灭绝得越彻底，它们的统治范围就扩展得越广，不仅控制着覆盖各大洲的森林，而且能进入留存在地球上的人的思维深处。从久远的、引起恐惧和疑虑的祖辈开始，它们不断伸出颈项，举起利爪，扩大自己的势力范围。（卡尔维诺《恐龙》）Now I understand that the more completely the dinosaurs were annihilated, the wider their domain extended. They not only controlled the forests that covered the continents, but also penetrated into the depths of human thought that remained on Earth. Starting from the ancient, fear and doubt inducing ancestors, they continuously stretched out their necks and raised their claws, expanding their domain.（Calvino \"The Dinosaurs.\"）",
