She wants a prince (as mass culture taught her to want), and he is only a man.On their first date, they plan their perfect love like a project. But he hates being alone more than he loves her and this will not do! They go on with their absurd perfect love project ignoring that the country around them is slowly falling apart.In the end, they go to the countryside and become fantastic characters from a Romanian fairytale. Fantasy takes over and they will emerge from it more mature. Acting out ends here.",
