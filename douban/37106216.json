    "introduction": "Un altre home is a contemporary love story, with touches of comedy, that explores the complexity of relationships and the crucial decisions that are made in one's thirties,” says the filmmaker. “Marc (played by Lluís Marquès) and Eudald (played by Quim Ávila), a stable union with an apparently well-ordered life, are destabilised by the unexpected arrival of a new neighbour opposite. As Marc confronts his own feelings of non-conformity and Eudald's continual attempts to strengthen their relationship, the film reflects on love, expectations and loss at a key moment in life.",
