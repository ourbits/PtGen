    "introduction": "São Tomé, a tropical island, the head of a pin off the west coast of Africa and right on the equator, the middle of nowhere. There lies an old woman, dying, who calls to her distant son. Her cry becomes concrete as a breadfruit of gigantic proportions, a huge thing, falls to the ground in front of the son's hut. 'Ma is calling me!' He names the monster Little Fruit, this vegetable meteorite, and begins his journey. Little Fruit treks across the island and into the city to Ma, through much danger and many challenges, spells and counter-spells. A turbulent tour. 'Little Fruit' is a burlesque, an African fairy tale, documentary and road movie, the description of a wondrous island world. Its residents are the actors in the 'song of Ma'.",
