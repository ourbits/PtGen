    "introduction": "Death of a Nation: The Timor Conspiracy is a 1994 Central Independent Television documentary, written and presented by John Pilger, and directed and produced by David Munro, which uncovers the complicity of the US and Great Britain governments in the East Timor genocide in the context of the 1990-91 Gulf War. \"Accusations of genocide fly in this disturbing and controversial British documentary,\" writes Sandra Brennan of Allmovie, as well as, \"disturbing accusations regarding the complacency of the U.S., British, and Australian governments who purportedly knew about the killing and did nothing.\" An updated version of the film entitled The Timor Conspiracy was released in 1999.",
