    "introduction": "During the time of communism in Bulgaria, at a gas station, Dimitar loses his bag filled with his savings of socialist money, soon to be worthless. Some years pass until, Dimitar loses his bag containing an English Grammar book necessary for the new era of political transformation. A decade later, in a time of big crisis, Dimitar's bag is stolen from his car and he is blackmailed to get his documents back. Dimitar retires. He is arrested because he has forgotten his bag in a hotel lounge and it is mistaken for a terrorist bomb. While being interrogated in the police station he realises that he has failed as a father. At the end of his life in the hospital Dimitar is trying to remember where his bag is. Dimitar’s son is there and they talk about the past and the missed moments. They hug for the first time.",
