    "introduction": "\"What would you do if someone was living your life better than you were?\" This is the question Karen Addams must answer...if she doesn't lose her mind first. To make matters worse, this \"someone\" is doing a better job at being Karen Addams...than is Karen Addams! A struggling journalist more concerned with compassion than \"gloom and doom,\" she is forced to fight for her sanity, and her very life, when the unknown person starts to take over every aspect of her existence - her love life, her career and her friendships. But how can she win when the enemy is a better version of herself? Greg Johnson has a similar problem...but one that is far more dangerous. Yesterday he was a mild mannered accountant. Today everyone thinks he's a mass murderer. Greg knows that Karen may be the one person who can help him. Unfortunately, she's leading the man-hunt to capture him. The old theater owner, Kyle Mansfield, might be able to help them if, of course, he wasn't insane! One thing is for sure...\"Karen Addams\" will live happily ever after. It's just a matter of who she'll be.",
