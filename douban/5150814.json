    "introduction": "Loosely inspired by Dostoevsky's CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, 'DISSOLUTION' combines an almost surreal fairy-tale energy with brutal black and white realism to explore the condition of violence which permeates contemporary Israeli society. Shot in Jaffa-the predominantly Arab area of Tel Aviv- the movie follows the moral collapse and first glimmer of redemption of a young Israeli Jew, played brilliantly by non-actor, Didi Fire. This is a deeply personal work about one man's inner journey, but can also be read as an allegory about Israel's moral responsibility...as well as a portrayal of male violence towards a devalued feminine.",
