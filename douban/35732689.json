    "introduction": "If the mountains have a soul, then it's huge ... 90 years ago, a young student did what was unimaginable until then. Wieslaw Stanislawski climbed new, challenging routes in the largest walls of the Slovak Tatras. Only with a hemp rope around the waist, but with immense passion and desire. Two friends followed in his footsteps to the Tatra walls in winter conditions. They connect his paths and the mountains connect their thoughts. In the falling avalanches and the sun's rays, they find Stanislawski's message: If a person does something from the depths of his heart, he does his best.",
