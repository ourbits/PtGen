    "introduction": "Vianet D'jenguet has lived half of his life in Europe, yet his heart still lies in his homeland, his Congo. As a successful wildlife cameraman, D'jenguet is returning to his roots to reveal the beauty and majesty of his country and its people. During his journey, D'jenguet explores a vibrant \"African Eden\" - a Congo complete with chimps, gorillas, weaver birds, Colobus monkeys, swamp antelopes, forest elephants and buffalo - and a jungle tribe who still reveres his great-grandfather. D'jenguet shines a spotlight on his beloved homeland and discovers an even deeper connection with this place than he ever imagined",
