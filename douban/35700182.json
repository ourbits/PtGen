Without prior notice she is suddenly standing in front of the foreigners house, who is living in seclusion on a northern German island and whos existence she did not know of until lately. Repressing the memory of her bereavement she stumbles into an unfamiliar life among fish sandwiches, yellowed bowling alleys and mysterious brent geese.",
