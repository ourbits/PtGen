    "introduction": "With no one able to provide an explanation, let alone offer a solution, one day Marina discovers that her face has changed completely. That is the fantastical, absurdist starting point for an inquiry about identity that spreads in many directions—the misadventures faced by the main character, who’s immersed in a very strange conflict –as well as the new possibilities this opens for her—, begin to intertwine with a series of audiovisual reflections on images and faces, both human and those of the other species with which we coexists or connect one way or another. What do a face, a footprint or a name mean? What is it that makes us be who we are? In a hybrid format between fiction, documentary and essay, The Face of the Jellyfish invites us to wonder what is left of us once we look in the mirror and do not recognize ourselves.源自：https://www.mardelplatafilmfest.com/37/en/pelicula/el-rostro-de-la-medusa---------------One day, Marina no longer recognises herself. Is she ill, a different person, prettier? Those around her take it in their stride, her doctor is puzzled, the authorities block her ID card. A gentle comedy that poses serious questions about the human face.源自：https://www.berlinale.de/en/2023/programme/202301978.html",
