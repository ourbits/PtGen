    "introduction": "This wonderful drawn animated short is based on a childrens book by Jorge Diaz and Øivind S. Jorfald. It tells the story about an illiterate dictator bans all reading and writing. But an old man trains birds to print his messages. The wind carries poems and leaflets to all parts of the town ... and the rebellious alphabet comes to life. Witty and innovative, this political fable combines poetry and humour with bold, detailed animation and raises powerful issues about censorship and resistance.",
