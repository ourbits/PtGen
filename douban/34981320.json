    "introduction": "Chong Ren He was born in 1937 in a village in southwestern China, on the border with Tibet. He is a member of the Naxi people, an ethnic minority with only 300,000 members, fighting actively to preserve their millennia-old Dongba culture. It is a struggle he is now carrying on in front of a camera wielded by his documentary filmmaker daughter, who accompanies him on a trip to his native land. The precious and rare use of Dongba symbols, ancient music, art and traditions: more than a culture, the film reveals an admirable man’s profound spirituality.",
