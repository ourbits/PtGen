    "introduction": "Based on the famous books by La Comptesse de Ségur, this series follows Sophie de Rean from the age of 7 to 12. Growing up with overly strict parents who respond to her curiosity and sharp-wit by punishing her, Sophie is orphaned and left with an evil and tyrannical step-mother. Back in France, Sophie is unrecognizable, bad-tempered and sly but she returns to normal under the tender and fair minded care of Madame de Fleurville. This story is treated in the style of a melodrama. However, the “mishaps”, which happen all around Sophie, offer a touch of mischief and fantasy which will appeal to a young audience.",
