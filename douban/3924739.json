But, Shaq’s most interesting opponent booked for the series is Serena Williams !Like his other co-stars/athletes, including Phelps who Shaq will swim against in the first episode, Williams will likely face off with Shaq on home turf = the tennis court… It will be interesting to see who wins that match… Shaq Vs. Wimbledon champ Serena Williams…“Shaq Vs.” is slated to air on ABC with at least six episodes confirmed, including a football based episode with Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.",
