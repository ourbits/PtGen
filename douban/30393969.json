    "introduction": "A crime-thriller retro-road movie based on the true story of the Kuratong Baleleng gang in the Philippines and its downfall in the 1990s. It’s 1995 and Manila silently rots to the core. Thanks to a well-structured syndicate, criminals are free to roam the streets a day or two after being caught. Such would have been the fate of four \"repeat offenders\" until unseen hands throw in blows to blur the equation. If the gods play dice with the universe, you wouldn't want to be caught on the gambling table. Join the Bamboo Dogs on a nightmare ride along the streets of Mondomanila where invisible forces can protect or destroy. A crime film without the crime. Four criminals, four cops in a van. The longest ride in their lives.",
