With Dad recently passed away and Mum slowly losing the plot, it is 14-year-old Hazel who shoulders the burden, managing the failing farm and keeping her younger siblings from careering completely off the rails. They all suspect there won't be much Christmas joy this year, but when a strange man dressed as Santa Claus crashes a van full of toys onto their property, their world is turned upside down in ways they could never have imagined..",
