    "introduction": "The new series follows Ross as he explores the remnants of some of the most significant moments in British history, including the site of one of the most famous shipwrecks ever discovered, the Mary Rose to mark the 40th anniversary that the ship was raised. Ross and his team also dive on the wreckage of D-Day abandoned in the English Channel, wrecks off the Cornish coast, and as far afield as the Red Sea in search of Britain’s Imperial past. On his journey, Ross is once again joined by marine archaeologist Mallory Haas and legendary dive master Neil Brock along with tank expert and safety diver Mark Culwick joining the team with a host of new historians and maritime experts.S2 E1 - The Mary RoseS2 E2 - SuezS2 E3 - Nazi MenaceS2 E4 - D-Day[ROSS KEMP: DEEP SEA TREASURE HUNTER S2: EPISODE GUIDE](https://www.history.co.uk/articles/ross-kemp-deep-sea-treasure-hunter-s2-episode-guide)",
