    "introduction": "Three women from the director’s family represent a cross-section of the large Russian minority living in Latvia. The grandmother came to Latvia in 1955, and at the age of 93, she is fighting for her life and awaiting the 9 May celebrations, where she will be one of the only surviving veterans and a star at the event; the mother is a lecturer at a Russian-speaking university that is about to be closed down; and the sister is starting her adult life by discovering love and trying to break away from her family. The film seeks to understand whether they will ever be fully accepted by Latvian society or whether they really want to be.",
