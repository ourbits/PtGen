Thirty heterosexual families rejected her before the court decided to entrust her to him: with him, the legal foster care register for singles was inaugurated in Italy. Luca was in fact the first case in Italy of a single, homosexual person succeeding in adopting a daughter. But his was not a charitable gesture: he simply wanted a family.",
