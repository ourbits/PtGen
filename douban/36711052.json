    "introduction": "Glass Life is a dynamic configuration of images and video accumulated over the years on the artist’s hard drives. From her studio, the artist uses her computer and various studio set-ups to make sense of her visual archive – and the world outside. Luscious pictures of food, political figures, screen idols, sportswomen, Instagram models, grand artworks, cartoon characters, emojis and self-portraits, among many other images, vie for our attention. A dizzying navigation through our consumerist visual world.",
