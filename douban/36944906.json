    "introduction": "Roaming through rural France on their tandem bike, young post-punk musicians look for an audience and a name for their band. “Gwendoline,” directed by Joaquim Bayle, is a beautifully shot musical odyssey in 16mm black-and-white film that’s both bleak and lighthearted. On the road desperately seeking fans, or a stage, or a band name, Micka and Pierre come into contact with some locals who, for the most part, despise their act and their edgy sound. That is, until an older man in a black leather jacket sees something in the group and offers to take care of their pet turtle while they take off further down the road. Told in four brief chapters, the film is a darkly whimsical journey, an ode to artistic seekers, to fish out of water in the quiet countryside. -KA.",
