Winthrop thinks Isabel has left him for good, gets a divorce although he still loves Isabel, and takes up light-housekeeping with Mary, whom he also learns to love. Isabel returns and is not happy about sharing her husband with another woman,especially since Isabel is the first-wife-of-record and Mary isn't. Mary is so taken with Winthrop's happiness that she decides to commit suicide in order to keep Winthrop and Isabel together. But then she has a second thought that indicates good-hearted and liberal Isabel isn't adverse to sharing. Winthrop smiles.",
