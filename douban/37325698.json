They know who to bribe to solve any issue, who to press and who to threaten to get things done. Every day is a rat race. One day the Minister finds out that his reign will be over in a week, and all the future holds for him is a house-check, Kolyma camps and life behind bars, and both deputies will follow him under the convoy. However, the deputies do not like the prospect, and they decide to find a way to redirect the one-way ticket to Kolyma to someone else.",
