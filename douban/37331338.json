After Asad learns that he did not inherit his late father's property, he is forced to experience life and work in the industrial city of Zenica at the beginning of the 1990s. Expecting to study while working, he quickly finds out that he has lost his right to education, and that life as a worker at the Zenica Steelworks is far from ordinary. The phenomenon of steel mill wages, cafés, gambling, shops, and the production of illegal mills affect him as well, which significantly impacts his family life.",
