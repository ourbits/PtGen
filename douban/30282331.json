    "introduction": "Mystery of the Lost Paintings is a seven-part television series produced by Sky Arts and developed as a collaboration between Peter Glidewell, Ballandi Arts and Factum Arte. The series focuses on eight great paintings by Caravaggio, Vermeer, Monet, Van Gogh, Franz Marc, Klimt, Lempicka, and Sutherland that were destroyed, stolen or lost during the 20th Century.The programme follows a team from Factum Arte as they scan, print, paint and work to understand and recreate each painting. Each hour-long episode narrates the story of an artist, their painting, and how it was lost. The emphasis of each episode is not the recreation itself but a highly detailed performance revealing the artist´s biography, the character of the original painting and the discussions that accompany the rematerialisation.",
