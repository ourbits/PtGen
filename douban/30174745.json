    "introduction": "In a home filled with rare art objects from around the world, a disjunctured set of  tales unravel about the travels of collector Don Boros.  Dislocating fact, from fiction, and time from place, the stories are interwoven with the notable text “Sensations of Tone” by 19th century physicist Hermann von Helmholtz.  This work is an interactive film  incorporating the audiences iPhones to shape the film and audience experience in very different way sonically, visually, and conceptually. Sounds are distributed throughout the audience utilizing the acoustic architecture of the theater and visuals are used to bring a different context to the narrative through text and image.",
