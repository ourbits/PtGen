    "introduction": "Emily Proctor is found stabbed in Hyde Park. The police learn that the 23-year-old was living her dream. She had obtained a first in law and was a pupil in the Chambers of well-known barrister Tony Wainwright. At age 13, Emily had first seen Wainwright in a television documentary about refugees and had always wanted to work with him. As Lynley and Havers look into her background, however, they are able to paint a more complex picture of the victim. She had recently reunited with her half-sister and was involved in the Internet sex industry. When the police learn that Wainwright's fiancée was killed a few days before his wedding 15 years earlier, the investigation takes a new direction.",
