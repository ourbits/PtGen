Emotional entanglements enslave them to each other to such an extent that they break bonds even with their own kith and kin. It is common for stray notes to sprout up when two people live with each other and associate. But, veteran orchestrators as they are, they conjure up symphonies out of thin air with the magic wand of their love and set up Harmony in the Music of their Married Life.",
