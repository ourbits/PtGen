    "introduction": "Conjointly, ancient artifacts around the world are vanishing and the archaeologists and scientists responsible for handling them are disappearing too. Questioning who is responsible and why, a rogue diplomat suddenly comes into possession of a valuable artifact and, fearing the dangers that come with it, entrusts it to three children - Mehmood (13), Farooq (11), and Farzana (8) - the cleverest and most ingenious of them all, the Jamsheds. Inspector Jamshed, the lauded detective whose crime-solving accomplishments inspire a nation, is beloved by many and feared by the rest - that is, the criminals. As the relic is now in the hands of the Jamsheds, a suspenseful chase ensues with an array of espionage agents, assassins, underworld thugs, and a secret society that knows the artifact's true destructive power, all of them determined to take the relic for themselves.",
