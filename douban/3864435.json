    "introduction": "This Italian produced, NYC lensed heist picture is actually quite entertaining with a few nice twists. Retired safe cracker Chris Gretchko (Lee Van Cleef) is lured to a job by the son (Edward Albert) of an ex-buddy. He flies to NYC and finds out he will be lifting $1 million in diamonds for a shady German group. It all goes smoothly until he learns that the group has plans to kill the second he has the safe open. Directed by Antonio Margheriti (as Anthony Dawson), this flick benefits from a clever script, great performances and evocative locations in New York. Van Cleef is his usual gruff self and he plays most scenes off Albert or hippie chick/life saver Karen Black. Lionel Stander appears as Gretchko's old-time fence. Supporting roles include Peter Carsten as the German mob boss, Ron Van Clief as some karate chopping muscle and soon to be character actor Roy Brocksmith (the bald, fat guy from TOTAL RECALL) as the guy who gets ripped off.",
