    "introduction": "1992. South East London. Kerrie run's the long-time family business. A local, greasy-spoon café that serves the colourful community, her community. Days are long, money doesn't come easy and Kerrie is tired, but she gets by with a smile and a little help from her mum. Kerrie's violent ex-partner and the father of her only young son - who tragically passed away at a young age - is in prison for serious assault, while her own father, with whom she was so close, has also passed away. Without her eternal confidante, she soldiers on. One autumn evening, just as Kerrie is about to close the cafe, a mysterious elderly man enters and makes himself a bit too comfortable. He appears familiar to Kerrie yet insists on being a stranger. After a seemingly friendly but somewhat encroaching conversation, one with slight undercurrents of menace, he departs, leaving a conflicted, but long-lasting impression on Kerrie and her future.",
