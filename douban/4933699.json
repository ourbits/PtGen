    "introduction": "Originally titled Hiuch Ha'Gdi, the Israeli-made Smile of the Lamb is set along the battle-torn West Bank. Military governor Makram Khouri tries to flush out some fugitive PLO activists by hanging the rotting, stinking carcass of a dead donkey in a village square. Israeli doctor Rami Danon forgets his animosity towards the PLO and, out of compassion, cuts the carcass down. For disobeying Khouri's orders, Danon becomes as much a fugitive as the Palestinians. While in hiding, Danon befriends Arab hermit Tuncel Kurtiz, whose adopted son is a member of the PLO. An adaptation of David Grossman's masterful novel, it's certainly not as brilliant as the source, but still a very interesting film, which is one of the key moments in Israel's so called \"political cinema\" of the 80's.THe film was recipient of the Silver Bear Award at the Berlin International Film Festival.",
