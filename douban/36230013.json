    "introduction": "In this society, puppets and humans live in harmony, but that is polite fiction. Iconoclastic director, Bill Zebub, set out to make an absurd movie that hid wisdom in foolishness. Erin Brown, also known as Misty Mundae in some circles, stars alongside Lydia Lael in a strange film that you can enjoy without trying to delve deeper into the meaning. There is no correct interpretation. This is art, and as such, the experience is what you decide that it is.",
