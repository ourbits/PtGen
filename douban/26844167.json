    "introduction": "One of the first films, made during the Soviet times, which talks honestly about the complicated history of the Latvian people. During World War I, inspired by the idea of a free and independent Latvia, about 60, 000 men volunteered for the battalions of riflemen. At the time when the film was made – the beginning of the 80-ties – about 300 were still alive, aged from 80 to 100… Today, not a single one is left.  The film has captured unique and, by now, historical material, which does not have and will not have a contender.",
