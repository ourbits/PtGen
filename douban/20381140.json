This art DVD records her two-year residency, as she created paintings inspired by masterpieces in the National Gallery.She already had a lifelong attachment to paintings in the collection, yet the prolonged contact, particularly with Saint Francis in Meditation by Francisco de Zurbarán, led her to notice new details and unexpected nuances which influenced her own art.Through a series of interviews with Watt, this art DVD documents the formation of this exhibition, with particular emphasis on the creative process.",
