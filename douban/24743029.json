    "introduction": "When Europe skips class to climb aboard an eight-wheel truck with a magnetic young man named Jupiter, little does she know of the journey of initiation that lies ahead of her.\"As a child, I experienced the pleasure of fiction thanks to my elder brother who would read Ovid's Metamorphoses to me in secret. I can still see us in that room we shared, him sitting cross-legged with the hefty volume on his lap, holding on to it for dear life with both hands for fear it might slip, while I took charge of the lighting, focusing on the pages the yellow beam of a flash lamp whose battery would inevitably die. [...] After eight feature films, I felt that the time had come to reimmerse myself in the vivid, timeless writing of Ovid. At a time in which the very mention of Greece immediately conjures up 'Greek debt', I felt it was urgent to remind ourselves of 'Greek heritage'.\" [Christophe Honoré]",
