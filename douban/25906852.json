The storyline follows Annika Drake (Staite) and her friends who, following the unexplained death of her father, are pulled into a twisted mystery surrounding his former company, emerging tech giant Psylo5ense. Now run by her father's former business partner Aslin Kane (Hewlett), Psylo5ense is manufacturing a highly addictive new sensory experience called Vibe - a digital technology simulating a neurological condition called synesthesia - which is poised to become the new opiate of the masses.",
