    "introduction": "Francis, Luke and Raphael, now adults, walk through the black city with a suspicion hidden in their chests. No future to build, no ideal to cling to but only a vague feeling of oppression, inability to act, exasperated fatalism. Luke pleads before his father for a different social system while Francis confesses to his friend a few generations down the road the discomfort and weariness he feels being among his peers. Does giving air to this burden, this feeling of inadequacy because he is aware, really lead elsewhere? Luke goes to the stadium, Francis sings and plays with Raphael, then they meet again and drink and shout and laugh, hoping that the gray mood will change, that the emptiness they carry with them will be filled, just for a moment longer. The important thing all in all is to stay afloat.源自：https://www.visionidalmondo.it/en/movies-2022/dedalo/",
