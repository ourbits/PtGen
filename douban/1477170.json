    "introduction": "A fat, ugly creature whose sole purpose in life is the pursuit of sexual gratification is rapidly taking over Australia. The cane toad--Bufo marinus--was imported to Australia in 1935 in an attempt to rid the country of the Greyback beetle, which was devouring the sugarcane crop. Problem was, the beetle could fly, and the cane toad couldn't. What the cane toad was unusually proficient at, however, was making more cane toads. A very humorous look at a most peculiar problem.",
