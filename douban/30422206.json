    "introduction": "A man and a woman; a friendly chat about art, anal sex, and alternate realities gets out of control. A man and woman, trapped together in a room, having bizarre sex, playing mind games. But do they really? Everything goes sideways. Did the man rape the woman? Or is she trying to blackmail him? Secret motives, unexpected twists - even the protagonists seem to be confused when a third character enters the story line. Now things get messy.Written by Jürgen R. Weber",
