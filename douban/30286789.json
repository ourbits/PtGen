    "introduction": "In her native Sweden, everybody has an opinion about feminist trailblazer Gudrun Schyman: superhero or villain. She has been through all the ups and downs of political life: a social worker rising to lead the Leftist party to record breaking election results; publicly shamed for her struggles with addiction; overcoming her demons, and founding Europe's first feminist party. Through it all, Schyman has remained fiercely, unapologetically feminist, constantly working to raise the bar for equality in Sweden and in Europe. The FEMINIST follows Schyman through daily life and political breakthroughs.",
