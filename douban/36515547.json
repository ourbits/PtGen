    "introduction": "5 years on from the INFAMOUS tragedy on Ezekiel Twain's (James Ashton) smash hit sequel to \"Cry\" leading to the 'accidental' death of the lead actor Carlton Gunn (James Lock). Twain finally has his film green-lit again, after what seemed a CURSED chalice, from private investors. Once the camera begins to roll, TRAGEDY strikes again, this time it is not so 'accidental' with all the cast and crew at the remote studio being suspects. Known only as the HASHTAG KILLER. Karma is a bitch.",
