This is the definitive portrait of this remarkable landscape.An exquisite two part series that tells the rich narrative of Kerry’s natural history, geology and human story.Kerry: Tides of Time is an epic two part series that tells the rich and multi-dimensional story of the Kerry landscape, from its earliest origins, deep in the geological past, right up to the present day. The story is told by those who know this county intimately. The biologists, historians, ecologists and archaeologists who spend their lives profoundly connected to this landscape provide personal, revelatory, and often emotional insight that drives the narrative. The backdrop against which these films are set includes some of Irelands most iconic landmarks; from the Skellig Islands, to Carrauntoohil – Ireland’s highest mountain, and the magnificent Killarney National Park.With soundtrack scored by Bradley AyresProduced bySilver Branch Films in association with RTE, ZDF, Arte and ZDF Studios",
