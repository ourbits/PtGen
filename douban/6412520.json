    "introduction": "The beauty of the place and the beauty disarming Yun Jeong-hie that releases eroticism in a spontaneous and adding a sliding very interesting history and make it de Does cuckoo cry at Night a very interesting product and the viewer can not prove it for the poor and naive (but also good-hearted) Hyunbo. This film is based on a novel by a novel Bi-seok Jeong, and in my view succeeded in recreating quite closely the context. Definitely not a staple of cinema 80 years but the fact remains that the film deserves and it is very interesting to watch.",
