    "introduction": "根据19世纪波兰作家普鲁斯的同名小说改编成的电影。http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Outpost_(novel)The Outpost (Polish title: Placówka) was the first of four major novels by the Polish writer Boleslaw Prus. The author sought to bring attention to the plight of rural Poland, which had to contend with poverty, ignorance, neglect on the part of the country's upper crust, and colonization by German settlers backed by Otto von Bismarck's German government.The Outpost (1886) is not Boleslaw Prus' highest achievement as a novelist. It does not show the full psychological depth of The Doll (1889) or the conceptual sweep of Pharaoh (1895). The Outpost's \"happy ending\" has a somewhat contrived quality. Still, the book is a respectable achievement in the European tradition of the realistic novel. Despite Prus' reservations about Emile Zola's naturalism, the Polish writer took some inspirations from the French novelist. Prus' Outpost (1885-86) in turn influenced the Polish Nobel Prize-winning novelist Wladyslaw Reymont's treatment, two decades later, of rural life in The Peasants (1904–09). In 1979, The Outpost was produced as a Polish feature film (Placówka) directed by Zygmunt Skonieczny.",
