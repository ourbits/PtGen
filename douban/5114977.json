    "introduction": "A group of 10 disparate people, strangers to each other, have all traveled to Africa believing they have won a fabulous vacation safari. Things turn ominous from the beginning, however. First their native guides abandon them, more natives cut a bridge line across a deep canyon (their only way in and out of camp), and their host is strangely absent. Then events go from being unsettling to deadly when the guests start dying one at a time, and those who remain realize that they are being slaughtered one by one — but who is responsible?",
