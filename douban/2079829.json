    "introduction": "The Queens of Comedy Gina Riley (Kim) and Jane Turner (Kath) are back in this fantastic telemovie \"Da Kath & Kim Code\". While the first and second seasons of \"Kath & Kim\" were unbelievably amazing, the third was not as good. However, those foxy morons are back on top once more with \"Da Kath & Kim Code\", a Christmas Special telemovie. As usual, Gina and Jane are fantastic as Kim and Kath respectively, they are always on the mark with their characters which they have perfected to the beat. Congratulations to the both of them for creating something so amazing.Magda Szubanski returns as long-suffering Sharon, and thankfully, she is funnier than she was in Season 3. Peter Rowsthorn reprises his role as Kim's never-do-well husband Brett, and Glenn Robbins is back as Kath's \"great hunk of spunk\" man, Kel. All three actors are on top of their game as usual. Zara Harrington once again plays Epponnee Rae Craig, and this time says her first word. Peta Brady, who has previously appeared as Brett's boss, Kelly, gets a decent amount of screen time, and is awesome. Michael Buble appears as himself, while Barry Humphries plays a monk, and doesn't get to upstage any of the core cast. Also look out for Judith Lucy who makes a small appearance.There are plenty of plots and sub-plots going on to keep the audience interested and the five main cast all have plenty to do. The outfits are, as usual, a scream, and the characters all doing their typical thing, which is terrific. Only, what's different this time around is that there is a very definite change for at least one of the core cast. It was quite shocking, for in usual sitcoms, all the characters have to return to how they were at the beginning of the episode, though this time, one of them changes, and the other's won't find out about it until the franchise returns in its fifth outing. The only let-down with \"Da Kath & Kim Code\" is that Prue and Trude feature far too much. They were fine in small doses in seasons 1 and 2, but here, and even in Season 3, they got far too much screen time. They aren't really that funny in large doses, and I think what they are saying may get lost on some people. But nevertheless, another great achievement for Gina Riley, Jane Turner and the rest.",
