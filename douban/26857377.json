    "introduction": "Contemporary detective drama DCI Banks starring Stephen Tompkinson (Trollied, Truckers, Wild At Heart), Andrea Lowe (Love Life, Monroe) and Caroline Catz (Doc Martin) is returning to ITV, set in the stunning county of Yorkshire.The six‐part drama features new cast members Samuel Anderson (Trollied, Doctor Who) who plays Vince, the latest member of Banks’ team, Shaun Dingwall (Legends, Silent Witness) as Chief Superintendent Colin Anderson, Shaun Dooley (Broadchurch, Ordinary Lies) as hardened career criminal Steve Richards and Maimie McCoy (Musketeers) as Richards’ wife, Tamsin.The series also sees the return of popular cast members Jack Deam (New Tricks, Casualty) as DC Ken Blackstone and Keith Barron (Holby City, Doctors) as Banks’ father, Arthur Banks.Produced by award‐winning indie Left Bank Pictures, series five is set to be the grittiest season yet with the Yorkshire detective facing Banks’ toughest investigation to date.The series is comprised of 6 x 60’ original episodes inspired by the books from acclaimed novelist Peter Robinson. The drama features self‐contained stories told over two episodes, but also, in an explosive serial crime story that weaves throughout the whole series, DCI Banks will be forced to question all that he holds dear, as he pits his detective skills against a criminal who will stop at nothing to escape the law.When Banks confronts a powerful adversary who has been dubbed by his superiors as too big to bring down, his dogged pursuit of justice sets in motion a chain of events that rips at the very fabric of his life, both professional and personal.Helen encounters unexpected challenges when she tries for promotion and Annie pursues her own results‐driven, gut instinct style of policing which threatens to ruin her relationship with Banks.",
