    "introduction": "“We endured gender discrimination for a long time, and now we’re starting to speak out.” Sound familiar? This is from a KBS talk show taped sometime in the 1980s/1990s, when the Republic of Korea was faced with a paradoxical situation: on the one hand, economic growth and social reforms had changed the situation of women in principle – but not in practice, as White Slavery was rampant and rape a widely downplayed crime, while men behaved grosso modo as if nothing had happened and blah-blah’ed about women as flowers and some such.In her contribution to Modern Korea, a TV documentary series based on archival materials and research, Jeong Jaeeun investigates how state television presented discrimination and violence against women in teleplays, talk and variety shows as well as news items. A timely think piece of rare cinematic elegance!",
