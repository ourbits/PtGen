Susan, outwardly confident and Becky, more fragile and shy, both in their late twenties, are inseparable best friends. Before Becky’s imminent wedding, Susan treats Becky to a holiday on the moors. However, Susan’s motives for visiting Dartmoor are far from selfless and it turns out she’s motivated by something other than rugged landscapes. Both women have secrets they have not shared, some recent, some long past and deeply buried. After their encounter with the handsome charming Chris, they are led into a web of mind games, sexual deceit and betrayal. As Becky’s traumatic involvement in Chris’ own damaged past is revealed, a psychological journey swiftly becomes a fight for survival.",
