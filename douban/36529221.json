    "introduction": "Dirk Bridle has just come out of prison in Birmingham. For eight years he was inside for a crime he did not commit. After work in 2013 he headed home and dozed off at the wheel, it had been a long shift. He lost control of his car and careened into a bus stop killing a teenager. Dirk always maintained his story of falling asleep but the police charged him with drunk driving. He had not had a drink. His case had either been tampered with, or evidence created and he was sent down. He knew he had killed the boy but not in the circumstances the authorities framed it in. Eight years later, he has been cast out into the world without help, guidance or counselling. He should have done 10 years but he was out on good behaviour. His probation office, Peter Roberts, is kind and helpful. Dirk had an affair with a prison officer, Josh Cummings, while he was inside.",
