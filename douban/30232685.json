    "introduction": "Inspired by her own personal journey of making National Geographic’s critically acclaimed, groundbreaking documentary Gender Revolution, Katie Couric’s new series, AMERICA INSIDE OUT WITH KATIE COURIC, will follow her as she travels the country to sit down with the people shaping the most pivotal, evolving, contentious and often confusing topics in American culture today. From interviewing founding members at the violent and terror-filled “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville to spending time with young, female Muslim entrepreneurs in Brooklyn to an in-depth look at America’s white working class, Couric enlists cultural icons and regular folks to help her look past the noise, politics and individual discomfort to understand the complicated truth about the complexities of religion, race, technology and cultural norms, while highlighting the humanity beneath the surface.",
