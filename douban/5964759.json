Joyce Barnaby has already won her own competition and is now one of the \"perfect village\" judges. Meanwhile, Barnaby and Troy are investigating a series of break-ins in the area. When the thief, Peter Drinkwater, is found murdered, there are no end of suspects: a jealous husband; a spurned girlfriend and her irate parents; one of the robbery victims who is not being entirely truthful with the police; and finally several members of the village committee whose only concern is how the death will affect their chances in the perfect village competition. In the end, Barnaby must establish the link between these most recent events and a murder some years earlier.",
