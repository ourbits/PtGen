    "introduction": "Yellow Flowers will be based on the cross-over between the darker Czech crime pioneered by Peter Schulhoff’s movies – which starred Rudolf Hrušínský in the main role as Major Kalaš, the so-called “kalašovka” that paved the way for other domestic noir films in the 1970s – and Italian giallo flicks. The story is set in a sleepy, small Czechoslovakian town in the 1970s, where a string of murders occurs. The investigation unearths the dark past of the locals as well as long-buried traumas.",
