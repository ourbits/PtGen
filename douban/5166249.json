    "introduction": "In 1220, long before Shakespeare, Saxo Grammaticus wrote down the legend of Amleth for the very first time - a savage and cruel tale revolving around young Danish prince Hamlet, who discovers that his uncle murdered his father to live with his mother. Hamlet decides to take revenge...Preserving the nuts and bolts of the original story, Fritsch transfers it into a strange filmic twilight zone where a line's delivery is more revealing than its content, assembling a filmic language borrowing from the classical as well as from the grotesque, resulting in an intelligent kind of grand guignol where style never distracts from substance.After Hamlet has been adapted for the stage a.o. by Heiner Müller or Christoph Schlingensief, Herbert Fritsch's filmic take counts among the freshest and most unusual; a mixture between Herbert Achternbusch and Luis Buñuel, paired with an intelligent use of digital special effects, ELEVEN UNCLES is a truly uncompromising take on classical material and one of the funniest experimental films in a very long time.See actor-turned-director Herbert Fritsch at the height of his game, playing Hamlet's uncle 11 times at once!",
