    "introduction": "About a young man (JAG/Me/Self) who is looking for an identity. He meets a woman, Ebba, they move in together, marry, but the marriage is becoming more and more disharmonious and dysfunctional. On the bus he run into a woman from his past, Ann-Marie. They reconnect on some level, but Ann-Marie has a family. At the same time, this is driving the relationship with the wife towards a crisis. In a surrealistic dream sequence, he experiences his anxious life situation during, among other things, a dark midnight mass and a bus journey, which becomes a big city version of the journey across Styx. When he wakes up, some of the anxiety knots may have dissolved. Maybe he is on his way into a community he has always sought, an affinity where he can find, implement and develop his real identity.",
