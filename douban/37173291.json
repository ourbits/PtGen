    "introduction": "An average stray dog has 99 percent of wolf's genes and it's a natural born hunter. But they forgot how to hunt when humans brought them to civilization. Now they are left on their own in the unmerciful hands of the public shelter hunters who kill them and throw them in the river. This seems to be the greatest country's problem today, because all the country is constantly protesting for the poor dogs, led by \"Magnolia\". One of these poor average stray dogs, found their luck at Max's single student room in Skopje where \"Magnolia\" pushed him into signing a document to become the dog's legal owner. But when the \"legally male\" dog gives birth to 4 new stray puppies in Max's home, he becomes desperate, so he knocks on the doors of \"PAW LAW\" where \"Magnolia\" keeps all the saved stray dogs, some stuff, some volunteers, some journalists - And her daughter. Eventually, the 4 little puppies he brings there, open an unsolvable Hegel's conflict that impacts all the country all over and over again. The battle for the dogs keeps burning, but when nobody would accept the responsibility, the puppies have no other choice, but become hunters again.",
