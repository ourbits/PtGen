    "introduction": "Ingeborg and Adam live and work together as hand surgeons. Ingeborg is a kleptomaniac. During a fit, she hurts her ankle and gets a walking aid. As she becomes attached to her new sensitive body part, envious Adam finds his own object of desire. While exploring their objectophilias, the mysterious Melanie begins working for them. She has unusually wild armpit hair, and she uses dried mushrooms to soak up her sweat with. Gradually, she lures the couple into a surreal dialogue with nature.",
