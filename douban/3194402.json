    "introduction": "阿根廷独立电影女导演。Visually beautiful and profound. This film is a gem! Although a woman's sensibility (director/writer Mercedes Garcia Guevara) pervades, this work should have universal appeal. It's essentially a story of reclamation and redemption, told through visual and subtle means...a true cinematic experience that left me moved and thoughtful. Paola Krum, as Ana, the working mother and wife of a business man, sets the right-on tone of deep feeling, anguish and passion. Ana, on her journey of investigation and discovery, finds more than she thought she was looking for...a meeting with a man who accepts and \"knows\" her without a need for the facts of her life. He, effectively played by Juan Palomino, is given a redemptive love to allow him the life he deserves. What also impressed and pleased me about this film was its mystery, its careful restraint, which never insulted my intelligence or intuitive ability.",
