    "introduction": "What do the religious right and the gay liberation movement have in common? Both were fortified by the efforts of one woman – Anita Bryant. Part document and part poem, I Just Wanted to Be Somebody brings us back to the late 1970’s and reflects on Bryant’s life and the impact she had. The film is comprised of news footage, commercials and Bryant’s own home movies. (Clips from I Just Wanted to Be Somebody appear in Gus Van Zant's film MILK.)",
