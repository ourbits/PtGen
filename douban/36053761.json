    "introduction": "THE CLINCH is a coming-of-age series about real adolescence, about moments in life when young people on the threshold of adulthood complete high school and become university students or find jobs, and start to fulfil or become disappointed with their ambitions. It is a period when life starts slapping us down and we must find a way to stay on our own feet. A period when every one of us realises who our true friends are and that life is not the fairytale our parents have been preparing us for. A period of life in which the story of twenty-year-old Aljoša begins – just as he is at a turning point of his life, trying to achieve balance between his father’s, his mother’s, and his own,highly improbable ambitions, and a love that is nearing its inevitable end.",
