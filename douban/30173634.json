    "introduction": "CLEO is played by Anna Franziska Jäger and is the story of a 17-year-old girl that survives a traumatic car accident, in which her parents died. After that fatal night, she loses herself in Brussels and seeks refuge with the older, mysterious Leos. Her father was a famous concert pianist and she has been playing as well since she was a child. Although she often listens to contemporary music, it is the piano – and especially Rachmaninov’s work – that plays a main role in Cleo’s coping process.",
