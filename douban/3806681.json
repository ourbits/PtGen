The elderly gentleman lives in northern Argentina on a remote farm. Completely out of the blue, he receives notice that his son has died and his grandson and daughter-in-law have left to go live in Spain. Bereft of his family and alone, the old man lives through some of the more difficult political times. Seven years go by and suddenly his grandson and daughter-in-law are back -- they had left because of the unrest. The grandson is exuberant about being with his granddad again, and now seven years older, he is more prepared to absorb some of the old gentleman's viewpoints and the truth about his father.",
