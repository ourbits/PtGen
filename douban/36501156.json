Uncomfortable in his Punjabi-American skin, ex-con turned 'scrapper' Jake carries the weight of both his family legacy and a violent past. Caring for a mentally-challenged older brother and with a young girlfriend and an unborn child on the way, when one last job presents a way out for good, he must decide between loyalty to blood ties or to his newfound family. Is a chance at a new life worth betraying their trust? He'll find himself thrown into the middle of a conflict between Punjabi and Mexican factions led by violent, ruthless figures. As events explode into brutal violence, with everyone he loves at stake, he may need to go to his own darkest places one more time to finally escape.",
