    "introduction": "The story true about the master thief who stole Edvard Munch’s iconic painting ‘The Scream’ – told by himself! A witty and wildly entertaining film about boyhood dreams, lost friendships and one of the world’s most famous works of art.As a young man in 1980’s Oslo, Pål and his best friend come up with a fresh idea: He wants to steal Edvard Munch’s world-famous painting ‘The Scream’. Not to sell it, but just to show he can. And he succeeds in the first go – almost! This was a time where you could get away with a Munch painting just by smashing a window in the museum. If you can find the right window, that is! And when Lillehammer is announced as the host city for the 1994 Winter Olympics, Pål comes up with the ultimate master plan for the large-scale heist while the police are out of town. The story of how it all went down is told by Pål himself, and it’s a true crime story of big dreams, ruined friendships and one of the world’s most famous paintings: a priceless piece of cardboard from 1893. With a cast of characters straight out of ‘The Pink Panther’, we also meet Pål’s opponent, a larger-than-life detective from Scotland Yard. A story that occasionally surpasses one’s wildest imagination.源自：https://cphdox.dk/film/the-man-who-stole-the-scream/",
