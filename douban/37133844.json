    "introduction": "Lillah Halla asked five Cubans to dance in front of the camera to music that sums up their lives at that moment. The songs are inaudible to the viewer, but the rooms in which the people dance, the way they move and their facial expressions as they listen reveal their state of mind.The people dance in their own bedrooms, wearing earphones. The setting is intimate, but they gaze directly into the camera, as if looking into a mirror. A family dances together in a tiny room, an old man stands in a flooded house and a teenager jumps on a bed in front of a wall covered with posters. The portraits combine to produce an impression of the socioeconomic situation in Cuba.",
