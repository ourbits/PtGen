    "introduction": "A revelatory essay film by Thom Andersen and film critic Noel Burch, RED HOLLYWOOD, which has been re-mastered and re-edited, examines the films made by the victims of the Hollywood Blacklist and offers a radically different perspective on a key period in the history of American cinema. An elaboration on Andersen's 1985 written essay, also called \"Red Hollywood,\" the documentary draws on extensive research, includes intimate interviews with former blacklisted artists such as Paul Jarrico, Ring Lardner, Jr., Alfred Levitt and Abraham Polonsky, and features clips from more than fifty films that span numerous genres and raise questions about war, race relations, class solidarity, women's labor and the studio system itself.  As described by Andersen and Burch, \"The victims of the Hollywood blacklist have been canonized as martyrs, but their film work in Hollywood is still largely denigrated or ignored. RED HOLLYWOOD considers this work to demonstrate how the Communists of Hollywood were sometimes able to express their ideas in the films they wrote and directed.\"",
