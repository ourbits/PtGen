BONNIE “PRINCE” BILLY), a strong willed Evangelical Christian, who endeavors to ensure his salvation. Inundated by a relentless fragility, Sean is confronted by a choice between the temptation of certainty and the chaotic, indifferent world around him. A meditation on friendship and mutual need, NEW JERUSALEM explores the allure and limitations of modern utopian belief.",
