    "introduction": "An original film improvised around Story of the Eye by Georges Bataille. Produced, directed and edited by Jo Ann Kaplan.A woman sits alone in a bare, white-tiled bath, reading Georges Bataille’s Story of the Eye. The bizarre events described by the text provoke a series of fantasies in which the room becomes a stage and the woman the main player. As her dreams unfold, she becomes the ‘eye’ of the story, and her own body the object of its gaze. With a feminine hand, Story of I plucks Bataille’s central metaphor from its original context and re-invents its erotic vision from the inside-out.The eye in the vagina, seen through blood, urine and tears, looks at itself in a mirror. ’..a brave attempt at coming to terms with that huge area of the sexual imagination that still remains off-llimits’ JG Ballard on Story of I",
