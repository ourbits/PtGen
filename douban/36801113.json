    "introduction": "Ingemo Engström’s debut was made as a graduation film from Hochschule für Fernsehen und Film in Munich where she had studied since 1967. The film is structured around a road trip taken by a recently divorced doctor as she visits her female friends, driven by her mute lover. Conversations around life circumstances and meditations on the ideal love structure the film. Katrin Seybold, a documentary filmmaker, talks about the politics of relationships; actor Edda Köchl discusses collective living, and Marxist educator Illona Schult about raising children in a commune.“A film about women’s utopias of love. What it shows is how a woman experiences a sense of déjà-vu when she is at the end of a fifixed relationship and the start of a utopian one. Encounters with other women are also shown, who reflflect on their own relationships and on other possible forms of being together. Their testimonies remain authentic even when placed in a context that draws on staging.” (Ingemo Engström)",
