    "introduction": "The true story of Otomo, a Black man seeking work and asylum in the German city of Stuttgart. However, all he finds is racism, police trouble and his final destiny. His one-day journey leads him to a run-down temporary employment agency where he is being rejected because he doesn't own an ID and proper shoes. Downcast he continues his purposeless trip. In a streetcar he encounters a racist trolley controller who wrongfully accuses him of having an invalid ticket. As the situation escalates, Otomo head-butts the controller and flees. With the police on his heels, Otomo decides to leave the country. He runs into a truck driver who is inclined to take Otomo to the Netherlands if he pays him 400 Deutsche Mark in advance - a load of money he doesn't have. His need of money leads to desperate measures, but also to a new love. However, Otomo's bloody final encounter with the police is not too far away.",
