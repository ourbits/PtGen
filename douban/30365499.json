    "introduction": "Fueled by the arrival of a young painter, Elpida is a housewife who finds refuge from her monotonous life in her own fantasy world. As this fantasy world becomes filled with thoughts of vengeful violence, the lines blur between fantasy and reality. As events progress, Elpida is forced to question her own reality as she struggles to remember what really happened. »Pause« is Tonia Mishiali’s debut as director of a feature film and is a personal movie about a woman’s struggle in an oppressive marriage. This movie is heavily influenced by Mishiali’s own upbringing in patriarchal Cyprus. »Pause« is a drama with dark humour that sinks viewers into the world of Elpida and makes them question the position of women as mothers, wives and daughters.",
