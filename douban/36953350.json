    "introduction": "This Might Hurt is a documentary that offers solutions to cure chronic pain. The film follows three chronic pain patients who have spent years searching for answers. Desperate for relief, they enter a new medical program - run by Dr. Howard Schubiner - that focuses on uncovering hidden causes of pain, and retraining their brains to switch the pain off. This new paradigm for diagnosis and treatment was found to be effective in several randomized trials, and it was recognized as a \"best practice\" by the HHS's task force to combat the opioid epidemic. This Might Hurt provides an intimate exploration and suggests a path to healing for millions.",
