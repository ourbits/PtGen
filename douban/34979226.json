    "introduction": "Daughter of immigrants, an idealistic American architect struggles to keep her dream alive as she journeys to discover why America abandoned World's Fairs.For generations of Americans, World’s Fairs captured visions of hope for the future as part of their collective memory. Mina Chow became fascinated with World’s Fairs when she saw pictures of her parents at the 1964 New York World’s Fair.  Beginning with their stories, Mina shares this legacy and the American values that inspired her to become an architect.She is excited to go to the 1st World's Fair in China.  With over 73 million visitors, the Shanghai World Expo breaks all attendance records for any event in human history.  But what she discovers there not only destroys her confidence as an American architect; it is symptomatic of a country that has lost its way.  Mina is discouraged but she begins a search for answers.",
