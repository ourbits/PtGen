    "introduction": "Margaret Thatcher was Britain's first and only woman Prime Minister. In her eleven years in office she defeated Argentina in the Falklands War and at home she battled the unions into submission. Under her guidance, the Conservative government brought in privatisation and deregulated the City. In this special programme to mark her passing, family, friends and former colleagues - as well as political opponents - recall her life, her extraordinary personality and her tumultuous years in power.",
