    "introduction": "Films Imaginaires (Imaginary Films) consists of texts from a range of works that had already been published here and there, and that were included in the revised edition of my collected Cinematic Works. I filmed these texts and converted them into intertitles for projection. The conversion of these texts to frames of film, and their subsequent projection, transforms these “films” into an even more progressive type of cinematic creation.MAURICE LEMAÎTRE",
