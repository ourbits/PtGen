    "introduction": "After a chasm of over two decades, thirty-three-year-old Jacobo reignites a connection with José Luis, a fifty-year-old Catholic priest navigating the twilight of his clerical life amid swirling allegations that have cast a shadow over his sacred vows. Jacobo's youth was marked by a profound rupture leaving behind a fissure of turbulence and unresolved longing. Yet, SALT WATER delves beyond the surface of these troubled waters, revealing undercurrents of enduring, if conflicted, attachment. As Jacobo wrestles with a maelstrom of resentment and the forbidden whispers of affection for José Luis, Pineda crafts a narrative that challenges the viewer to navigate the murky depths of human connections. Set against the evocative backdrop of a Colombian coastal town, where the sea mirrors the story's emotional tumult.",
