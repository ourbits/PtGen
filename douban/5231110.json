    "introduction": "Three sisters in suburbia have a new neighbor: Bill, fresh from divorce. Kate is the eldest, no nonsense, telling Gwen (who's 21) and Teresa (who's younger and constantly reads bride magazines) to stay away from Bill. But Gwen heads next door first chance she gets, and just before jumping into bed with him, tells Bill a grisly story about the death of the previous resident of his house. Kate and Teresa interrupt the goings on, Gwen tells Teresa that nothing happened, and Teresa heads next door in hopes of finding a husband. What if the naïve Teresa misreads Bill's signals. What will Katy do then?",
