    "introduction": "A man finds a new sense of himself in his old hometown in this drama from Japan. Tetsuro is a businessman from Tokyo who goes back to the coastal town where he grew up for the first time in years when he arrives to attend a memorial ceremony for his late grandmother. While he's back home, Tetsuro happens upon Yuki, who was his girlfriend in high school, and the two meet over cocktails to get reacquainted. Tetsuro and Yuki were both on their high school's yachting team, and after a few drinks he offers to join Yuki and some friends for a sailing trip that will circle the island of Hokkaido. The next morning, Tetsuro isn't so sure a return to sailing is such a good idea, but when his old friends come out of the woodwork to cheer him on, he finds himself warming to the task and it leads him to take a fresh look at his life in the city. Starring Ken Ishiguro, Misa Shimizu and Takako Uehara, Umikaze Ni Fukarete (aka Carried On A Sea Breeze) was directed by Toshiki Sato, best known to Japanese film fans for his noted \"Pink Films\" (softcore sex pictures), though he's also made hrillers and more serious dramas.",
