    "introduction": "Marco Cavallo is a four-meter blue sculpture that contains in its belly, like a Trojan horse, the dreams of freedom of the former inmates of the Trieste asylum. In 1972 it was a real horse from the park of the mental hospital, saved from planned slaughter by a letter sent to the Province by the patients who were prisoners there. In the fifty years since Law 180, it has become a symbol of Franco Basaglia’s liberation and cultural revolution, but today, following its “eviction” from the municipality of Muggia that housed it, it has begun a new journey across the country, bringing with it those still unfulfilled dreams and their inevitable contradictions.",
