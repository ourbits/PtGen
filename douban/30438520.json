    "introduction": "Columbus, the just-released new feature from acclaimed writer-director Hatef Alimardani, is an Iranian comedy for — and about — the Age of Trump. When an aristocratic Iranian family beset with various domestic and legal problems makes the unwise decision to immigrate to the United Sates, their trip coincides with Donald Trump’s polarizing election and his subsequent travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries. Alimardani’s veteran cast includes Farhad Aslani, Saeed Poursamimi, Shabnam Moghaddami, Majid Salehi, Hanieh Tavassoli, and Farideh Sepah Mansour.",
