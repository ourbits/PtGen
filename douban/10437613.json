    "introduction": "In 1903 Daniel Paul Schreber published Memoirs of My Nervous Illness, one of the most remarkable studies of madness 'from the inside' ever written. Schreber was a successful lawyer, already well into middle age when he started to receive messages from God, via a 'Writing Down Machine'. He spent the next nine years confined to an institution suffering delusions of cosmic control, and believing that the only way to save the world was for him to submit to God's plan to change him into a woman. Conceived as part of a transmedia project by Simon Pummell (Bodysong), Shock Head Soul uses documentary, drama and animation to piece together Schreber's story, combining beautiful images and formal precision with fascinating insights from psychiatrists, analysts and social commentators past and present. Shreber's case and his struggle to free himself from institutional care make for compelling viewing, revealing a fascinating mix of family secrets, psychotic visions, and questions of religious freedom and technological advancement that are still relevant today.Sandra Hebron文字来源：http://www.bfi.org.uk/lff/films/new_british_cinema/1796",
