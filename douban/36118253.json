Dumped by her philandering husband and reviled by her teenage daughter, Harriet decides to secretly live her dream of going to film school. She leads a double life and loves every minute of her adventures and misadventures in film school. When she gets her first professional directing job, she is horrified to find that the professional film environment is a cutthroat place run by bullies and their terrified minions. She pines for the nourishing artistic environment of film school. When she gets fired off her own film, replaced by her nemesis, and found out by her daughter, Harriet needs to decide if her film, film school, and her long-cherished ambition to be a director is pure folly or if it's a dream worth saving.",
