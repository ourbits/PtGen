    "introduction": "To some of the greatest performing magicians alive today, Jerry Andrus is the name of a legend. Renowned as one of the best and most influential \"close-up magic\" performers of our time, Jerry is equally regarded among scientists, educators and skeptics as a visionary, poet, philosopher, inventor and creator of truly astounding optical illusions. Andrus; The Man, the Mind & the Magic is the story of a modern day Da Vinci told by the man himself, along with extensive interviews from some of the notable thinkers, artists and magicians in the world today. Written by Robert Neary",
