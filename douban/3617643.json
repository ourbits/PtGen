    "introduction": "Moving spheres, such as balloons and bubbles, are superimposed on static backgrounds to suggest travel and discovery. There are perils: a boy falls, a lion roars. The lyric flights of hot-air balloons, flying machines, and dirigibles, and their accompanying music of the spheres, are sometimes interrupted by a jangling buzz. Circus images take over. Then, mechanical rhythms abound while a balloon-headed doll, perhaps alien, moves through a jungle scene. We end in a garden.",
