    "introduction": "If you liked \"You've got mail,\" you'll love Sirf Tum. The plot is very similar except it uses snail mail. I liked Sirf Tum, a story of two people who fall in love through the mail, much better because it is beautifully photographed, has great songs and dances, uses various parts of India (especially Southern India)to great advantage, and the acting, even from Johnny Lever, is top notch all the way. A little bit of Johnny Lever can go a a long way but he was only in the 1st half and was even fun to watch. The two leads, Sanjay Kapoor and Priya Gill, are fascinating in every frame. They are ably supported by everyone else in the cast.",
