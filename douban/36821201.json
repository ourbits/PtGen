    "introduction": "A quickfire portrait of the New York City ballroom scene in the ‘80s.Made by independent New York filmmakers Jeff Preiss and Diane Martel, this lively snapshot brings together footage from clubs and dance lessons alongside interviews with voguers and DJs.Made at a moment when the Ballroom scene was on the cusp of becoming a national news item, House of Trés explores how the evolution of music and dance have always influenced the scene’s energy. As one DJ notes when talking about all the different moves he’s seen on the dancefloor, “All the dances just evolve… You pick up stuff from them and they pick stuff up from you, you put a lot of different skills together, and you just have a great time.”",
