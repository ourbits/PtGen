    "introduction": "The film explores the international community and Croatian human rights organizations' accusations of war crimes committed after the wartime Operation Storm. In summer 1995, the Operation Storm resulted in final liberation of the occupied territories in Croatia. Minister Cacic's comment on the burning of Serb houses in Krajina area immediately after the operation triggered uproar among the members of HDZ party. Five years later, some dramatic facts leaked to the public, revealing that - as it seems - not everything had been taking place in accordance with the rules of war.",
