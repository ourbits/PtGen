This Brazilian-made film takes us to both shores, to how spiritual life, dance and song came with the captive people and took root in the new soil.Documentary about the African influence on Brazilian religiosity. This documentary illustrates the cultural link between Brazil and West Africa. Ge slavec trade from Africa to the New World in the late 17th century and the return of former slaves from Brazil to West Africa in the 19th century have left sustantial trails and had a considerable impact. 'Atlantico Negro' attempts to bring together the trails and contacts to form a recognisable whole, depicting West Africa in a new light.",
