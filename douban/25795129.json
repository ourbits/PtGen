    "introduction": "The Lady with Flower-Hair is a woman of forty, on whose hair have grown a set of carnations. She was different even from childhood. She now lives alone. She is preoccupied with the flowers on her hair but the co-existence of two beings with absolutely nothing in common is bound to cause discomfort for one of them. We witness the phases of her big decision on the last five days of her life. Eventually she favors the carnations over her own self and buries herself in cold soil so as to let the beautiful flowers spread themselves.",
