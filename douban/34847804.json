    "introduction": "When he came to Dion's office, his fiancée, Silvi, a beautiful but unreligious girl was caught in an elevator with Raka, a religious, innocent and strange young man who worked for Dion. Fearing that this would be the end of his life, Silvi vowed, if survived, he would change his life, become a Muslim woman who is obedient to God's command. It turned out that, for a second after he said that, the elevator door suddenly opened. Since then Silvi always overshadowed Raka who always reminds Silvi promise in the elevator. And after a few unfortunate attacks on Silvi, it was Raka who finally helped him until Silvi found his resolve. But not necessarily Dion agrees with Silvi's vow.",
