    "introduction": "Andrei Tarkovsky is the most famous Russian director, who during his lifetime was called a genius. He did not take many pictures, but they all became classics of world cinema. \"Andrey Rublev\", \"Solaris\", \"Mirror\", \"Stalker\". It seemed that he created his films from air, water and fire, from deep emotions and even his own dreams. This is an extremely sincere, confessional art, but what is the creator who created it?! What was this God who lived the mortal life of a man with his weaknesses, fears, doubts? For the first time we will tell about the real Andrei Tarkovsky, we will open the veil of his strange, mysterious and very personal worlds.The film-makers will take the audience on a tour of the VGIK, where they'll get acquainted with Tarkovsky's student personal files, and to \"Mosfilm\", where the director edited his films. They will see the dress of Hari, the heroine of \"Solaris\", which will be shown by actress Natalia Bondarchuk.",
