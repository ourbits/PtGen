Roam the primitive forest and thick swamps with bizarre dinosaurs and colossal amphibians. Enter a surreal world of bug-eyed giants and egg-laying mammals – where survival means enduring the sunless, six-month polar winter surrounded by meat-eaters with night vision. Join intrepid Antarctic scientists on a quest to understand the ice continent’s profound transformation over deep time -- investigating the parallels and differences between prehistoric climate events and human-triggered warming today.Welcome to the lost prehistoric world of Gondwana……WELCOME TO ANTARCTICA.",
