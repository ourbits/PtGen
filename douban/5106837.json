    "introduction": "Secvente(Sequences, reffering to film sequences) is Alexandru Tatos' quintessential film and one of the stepping stones of Romanian cinematography. Sadly, although being a critics and directors favorite ever since it's release, Secvente never managed to find a wide audience, mostly due to the limited distribution the film received during it's initial run in the communist years. This huge injustice was disappointingly never corrected and unless word doesn't spread over this uniquely original gem of Romanian Cinema, Secvente will most surely never reach the following it deserves.Secvente is structured in 3 merely related parts, all concerning sequences of a fictional film that is being shot by Alexandru Tatos, Florin Mihaileanu and the rest of the crew, the film, surprising moments of the crews life both on and off set, in the vein of other fourth wall breaking features of world cinema such as Truffaut's La nuit Americaine and the films of Jørgen Leth. In fact it's impossible to tell whether a fourth wall exists during the entire movie, as the haunting sensation that the characters may jump off and start a fight in your living room dominates the final climactic sequence, a sequence that may well contain the only piece of pure Romanian humor the Cinema was ever able to preserve during those years.",
