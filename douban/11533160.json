    "introduction": "Another World traces the biography of Danuta Szaflarska, one the most acclaimed female actors of Polish cinematography. Szaflarska’s rich body of work includes memorable roles in the classics Forbidden Songs (1947) and The Treasure (1949). At ninety-seven years of age, her ongoing work in film and theater includes contemporary material, such as her role in the stage play Między nami dobrze jest (Things Are Good Between Us) by Dorota Masłowska. The film is the result of a close collaboration between Szaflarska, director Dorota Kędzierzawska, and cinematographer Artur Reinhart. The veteran actress talks openly about many facets of her life, from her rural childhood and youth in occupied Poland, to revealing anecdotes from her long career.",
