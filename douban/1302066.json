    "introduction": "After the Truth (German: Nichts als die Wahrheit) is a 1999 German film depicting the fictional trial of Dr. Josef Mengele, known as the \"death angel of Auschwitz\". The film, starring Götz George as Mengele and Kai Wiesinger as his lawyer, is based on the original English-language screenplay by American writers Christopher and Kathleen Riley. The German title translates to \"Nothing but the truth\". The German phrase on the US promotional poster translates to \"Thou shalt not kill\", one of the Ten Commandments.One of the greatest challenges the legal system has ever faced. Dr. Josef Mengele, one of the most wanted Nazi war criminals turns himself in to the authorities to tell his \"truth\" to the world. A battle between conscience and evil... It's one thing to judge Josef Mengele from the standpoint of history, to demonize him basing solely on the documentation of his inhuman and horrible medical experiments. After The Truth presents us with Mengele's hypothetical trial, which forces us to review that judgment.The responsibility of our sense of right and wrong is mirrored in the film by the attorney Peter Rohm, whose idealistic belief in the legal system conflicts heavily with his emotional resistance to defending such a monster. The viewer is presented with Josef Mengele the man, flesh and blood, and must hear him out as he quite emotionally and rationally states the reasons for his work.As Mengele's testimony proceeds, the indignation of our conscience is aroused, yet we cannot help but perceive him as human, like ourselves, with passions and a purpose. To defend himself is his legal right and we must listen, somehow impartially. Is it possible he can convince us of his innocence? At the very least the viewer must consider the man, monster or not ...and his motives.Source: German films Service & Marketing GmbH德语维基：http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichts_als_die_Wahrheit_(Film)英文维基：http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nichts_als_die_Wahrheit影片简介：http://www.filmportal.de/df/bc/Credits,,,,,,,,EA43D4A6FC665006E03053D50B37753Dcredits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.html",
