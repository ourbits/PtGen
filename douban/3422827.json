    "introduction": "This is a film I picked up in the library. I hadn't heard about it at all, so I was wondering whether it was intended for TV or for the big screen. So, anyway, what got me watching this flick is mainly the cast: Mario Adorf, Günther Lamprecht and Bruno Ganz are, in my view, some of the finest actors Germany has (and Germany doesn't have a lot of them). The plot is something which rang a bell to me, I am quite sure that the main idea of this film borders on plagiarism: a former KZ-inmate is convinced of having discovered one of his torturers in a church posing as a man of God (Lamprecht). It reminded me of Dürrenmatt. Although the plot is definitely not something unheard of or never done before, I thought that the acting was good. The flashbacks to the youth of the three protagonists was somewhat too corny, but the confrontation scene in the church was well done and not a little melodramatic. This scene was worth watching, because Adorf, Lamprecht and Ganz display this kind of down to earth acting that far from the overly dramatic way of acting in Hollywood when it comes to the Holocaust. So, although this isn't the best movie I've ever seen on the Shoah, it's definitely not the worst, and that's why I give it 6 points.",
