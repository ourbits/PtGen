    "introduction": "Part groovy Italian exploitation and part gangster movie, about the only enjoyable part of this movie is studying the young Klaus Kinski. I suppose this was made before Klaus became unbearable to work with due to the fact this was one of eight movies he made in 1969 alone. He's young, strong, and takes direction well. Only a minor performance from Franco Citti (Bruno) whom you can also find in the Italian segment of The Godfather (1972) as Michael's bodyguard and in Pasolini's Decameron (1971) though not much elsewhere unless you like more Italian crime films. The rest of the cast played well, but the movie lacked direction from the beginning. At only 89 minutes, it felt that at 40 the movies should have already been finished. After the robbery and flashback portion, the movie ran out of steam and regressed into droll segments highlighting each robber's downfall. Ending with ineffective shootouts and car chases, I was squirming in my seat for the movie to wrap up what I already knew was going to happen. Aside from short scenes of dancing in a night club that was shot and edited in a decidedly \"groovier\" style than the rest of the movie",
