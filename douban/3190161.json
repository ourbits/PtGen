    "introduction": "传奇巴西地下电影杰作《杀死家庭看电影去》有两个版本，69年的原版（http://www.douban.com/subject/1791012/）和91年的这本翻拍版，导演Neville de Almeida同样来自70年代的“边缘电影”运动，此次与前辈Júlio Bressane共同改写了部分章节，却达到了意想不到的效果和好评，当然影片原本就有的反叛另类风格依然得以延续。。。A brilliant exemplary of the Brazilian new cinema! Matou a Família e Foi ao Cinema is the most astounding Brazilian movie of the 90's. As a remade of the classic masterpiece of the Cinema Novo with the same name, the movie drive us to a storm of feelings and doubts. In this version Julio Bressane, the original director, rewrote the script to best fit the new conception of an inhuman crime. Alexandre Frota is the tormented guy who kills the family and goes to the movies as if it doesn't really matters. He was at the time the most promiser upcoming artist. Frota today is a porn star. The trajectory of the character should be compared with the one made by Rodya Raskolnikov in the literature classic 'Crime and Punishment' written by Dostoyevsky. The director's vanguard position influenced by Locke shows us the real dilemma of a killer, the ambiguity of the human being. We can discern some Nietzsche's positivism influence in the picture as in the famous crime scene. To give us the sense of reality, Neville, the director, shot his movie in an exotic distribution of colors, inserting the purple and white tendency in our times. In his movie's composition impeccable, Neville remembers us of great cinema classics such as The Discreet Charm of the Burgeoisie and many of IstvAn Szabó pictures, such as Mephisto. Counting with a undefectable supporting casting, Matou a Família e Foi ao Cinema is the best representer of what's happening in the Brazilian cinema.",
