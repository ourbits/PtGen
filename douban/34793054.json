    "introduction": "This film takes us inside the imagination of Hilary Mantel, across a remarkable writing life, weaving together the stories, the themes, and the characters that appear in her work. We will see what she feels her journey has been from her first novel to the highly anticipated publication of The Mirror and the Light, the final novel in the Wolf Hall trilogy. The film offers an intimate portrait of Hilary in her own real world and led by the curiosity that has driven her from the beginning. It is Hilary’s story in Hilary’s voice.",
