She tries to fight them off in vale, is saved by a bunch of rowdies and a passing vagabond, “Sutenosuke”. Wounded from the attack, Sagiri is taken to a nearby brothel town Mukai village.Mukai village serves as a post town between the capital and the eastern plain. It is always busy as its open to everyone to come and go as they please.
