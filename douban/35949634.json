    "introduction": "Kelsey seems like the typical college freshman. So typical, in fact, that when she's found hanging in the closet with a Zara belt firmly tied around her neck, her three roommates are completely bewildered. Sure, college students off themselves all the time, but Kelsey? She's not the type. But how can they truly know a girl who was so full of secrets and lies? Turns out, Kelsey was toeing the line into \"Gone Girl\" territory. They find her hidden laptop, and it's picture after picture of dead bodies, blood splatter, and gruesome news articles. Our three roommates take on the harrowing case.",
