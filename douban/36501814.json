    "introduction": "Ross Kemp: Deep Sea Treasure Hunter sees the BAFTA award-winning documentary-maker dive on a series of incredible shipwrecks around the British coastline to reveal some of the nation’s murkiest and best-kept secrets.From the remains of a slave ship discovered off Plymouth, to the Kaiser’s sunken Imperial Fleet in Scapa Flow and an experimental submarine aircraft carrier, which sank with all passengers and crew on deck during its sea trials, Ross uncovers Britain’s hidden maritime past.Along with his fascination for seafaring history, Ross has a personal reason for undertaking this adventure as members of his family served at sea, with some being shipwrecked and not surviving to tell their tales. His great grandfather 'Pop' was in the Merchant Marines during World War II and survived being shipwrecked three times. Pop's two nephews both served and perished aboard HMS Hood when it went into battle against the Bismarck in May 1941.Ross is joined in his adventures by expert diver Emily Turton, maritime archaeologist and professional diver Mallory Haas and dive supervisor Neil Brock as they delve down into Britain’s past.S1 E1 - The U-Boat TerrorS1 E2 - The Kaiser Sunken FleetS1 E3 - Slaver Ship SecretsS1 E4 - Gun Runners[ROSS KEMP: DEEP SEA TREASURE HUNTER S1: EPISODE GUIDE](https://www.history.co.uk/articles/ross-kemp-shipwreck-treasure-hunter-episode-guide)",
