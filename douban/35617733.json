    "introduction": "A young artist, fatally injured in a car accident, foolishly entrusts a batch of compromising love letters to Borwick, a crooked and unscrupulous lawyer, instructing him to destroy them. Inizia così Georg Jacoby’s JOKEREN, a light-hearted entertainment picture set during the carnival in Nice, a romantic comedy with a touch of melodrama. With its international cast and crew and swanky Côte d’Azur setting, JOKEREN is in many ways a typical late-1920s “Film Europe” production. The film was based on a successful 1927 English stage play, “The Joker”, which had 155 performances in the West End.JOKEREN’s interiors were mostly shot at Nordisk’s Copenhagen studios in December 1927; the production then moved to the Grunewald studio in Berlin for the spectacular Savoy carnival party scenes. The location footage of the Nice carnival was shot after the completion of principal photography, shortly before the film’s Copenhagen premiere.",
