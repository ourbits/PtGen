    "introduction": "1992 and 1993 saw great changes in late-night talk shows: Jay Leno took the place of Johnny Carson, David Letterman switched networks and time slots, and Chevy Chase and newcomer Conan O'Brien started their own shows. After the dust cleared from the greatly-hyped \"talk-show wars\", Chase emerged as the undisputed loser. While the show's format differed little from that of its competition, and a star of Chase's caliber had no trouble finding well-known guests, the show simply failed to resonate with viewers, and ground to a humiliating halt as it was finally pulled off the air in mid-show.",
