    "introduction": "Almost Heroes is a fast-paced, single camera comedy about coming home again... when home is the last place you ever thought you’d end up.When seemingly slick and together Terry returns from Harvard business school for his father’s funeral, he expects it to be a quick trip down memory lane. But when he discovers the family comic book store is almost bankrupt, and he’s to blame, things get more complicated.  His head-in-the-clouds brother Peter is going to lose the store without help, and as far apart as they’ve grown, Terry can’t abandon his brother when he needs him most.Now ‘all-business’ Terry and ‘all-fun’ Peter have to work together to save the store, and mend a relationship that has been broken for years. It’s an ongoing battle as Terry tries to get Peter to grow up and take responsibility, while Peter tries to get Terry to get back in touch with the inner child he turned his back on years ago.Along with their larger-than-life best friend Bernie, who clearly carries a torch for Terry, they just try and keep themselves above water every week. Along the way this season they’ll face angry bikers, psychotic children, pirates, serial killers, love gone wrong, a medieval battle, and even a guy who shoots himself out of a cannon.Before long we begin to see that even though Terry was only staying to save Peter, it might be Peter who does the saving. As much as Terry tries to deny it, the store might be where he belongs.",
