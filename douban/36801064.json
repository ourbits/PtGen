    "introduction": "片名《佛跳墙》代表的，不仅是一道经典台菜，也是剧组在台湾南来北往的沿路观察，无所不在的佛像，就像一种精神寄托的符码；同时也象征二位主厨开放的心胸，总是能“跳”出框架创作，跨出舒适圈，接受不同文化的洗礼与体验。藉由西班牙和台湾两地之间的对比和交汇，从不同视角带来大家对星级美食的全新理解。Chef David Yárnoz runs a high-end restaurant in the North of Spain and also heads a replica of that restaurant in Taiwan. Since he hasn't been able to visit the Asian restaurant for 3 years due to the pandemic, he needs to embark on a vital trip. When he finally manages to travel to Taiwan, besides checking up how his restaurant is doing, he will also find contrasts and common ground with locals and will make a special friendship with chef Kai Ho.",
