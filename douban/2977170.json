    "introduction": "The wife of a commercial artist risks her life to discover the truth about her husband after he is accused of killing a woman. She believes that he could have committed the crime and sets out to prove it after the police are unable to locate a corpus delicti. First she visits her husband's father, a shrink. Just after leaving, she runs into the \"corpse\" who is very much alive and out to kill her. Fortunately, the wife survives. Unfortunately, her father-in-law isn't so lucky, but before he dies, he recognizes the she-killer as someone he knows all to well. ~ Sandra Brennan, All Movie Guide",
