Here, the film delves into the deep wounds left by the Russian occupation in the lives of the Ukrainian people.The film documents the struggle of Ukrainian survivors to rebuild their lives after the devastating destruction of their communities. Through their own voices and personal narratives, we witness their experiences, empathise with their suffering, and gain an understanding of their reality that surpasses that of any news report.",
