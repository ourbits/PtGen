    "introduction": "1986, Afghanistan. The Mujahideen announce the launch of a new air-defense system called Stinger, which could potentially end Soviet supremacy in the air. Commander of Intelligence, Major Okovalkov is assigned the mission of getting hold of this new weapon and to do this, he has to intercept a small caravan transporting, according to intelligence information, a couple of Stingers. However, as it turns out, the caravan is a large heavily guarded vehicle with a well-armed escort. Realising that the mission is doomed to fail before it has begun, Okovalkov decides to let the caravan pass and then return to his unit, but his plans are ruined when a young and inexperienced soldier suddenly opens fire. A fight ensues during which most of the Soviet squad is killed. With only seven survivors and no radio contact, Okovalkov's real ordeal begins when he is forced to march his injured men over 45 kilometres back to base.",
