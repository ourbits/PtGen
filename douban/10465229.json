    "introduction": "A group of pupils and school leavers agree to take part in a test and submit themselves to the tortures of the dreaded career interview. The young people are asked or rather interrogated about their goals and interests and their responses are evaluated. The questions that are put to these youths during this concentrated and multilayered experiment often reveal a more about their adult interviewers than the young interviewees. From time to time, the pig-headed, know-it-all tone of the questions can just be too much: ‘fuck off!’ says the last pupil.",
