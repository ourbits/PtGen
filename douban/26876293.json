    "introduction": "Itsuki, 40 years old Sushi sous-chef and the right hand of his father Mr.Hashimoto (68) in the high-end grip sushi restaurant – “Hashimoto”. Although the son has been working under his father for the past 20 years, they hold very different ideologies regarding food and life. Mr.Hashimoto runs his restaurant with a strict, traditional, and almost sterile approach. He treats his food like a piece of art and believes others should do the same. For Itsuki food is a way to a man’s heart and soul, a tool to connect to people’s emotions. When Mr.Hashimoto falls ill, he decides to pass the control of the restaurant to his son. Itsuki finds himself trapped between the need to continue his father’s heritage and in his own wishes.Every Fish Has His Own Season.",
