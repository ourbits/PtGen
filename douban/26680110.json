    "introduction": "This film is a work of art... about a man who got dealt, in many ways, a lousy hand. Lesser men would have stayed in their room, their neighborhood, and not confronted the pain. Doc was not that man. And from his pain, his longing, his love, he wrote some of the most beautiful songs ever... sang the blues with the heart of someone who has known what it is to be on the outside... and with his love, caring, compassionate nurturing soul made lifetime and devoted friends of some of the most amazing talents of the day.",
