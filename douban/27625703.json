However, Clara suffers from his explosive and extremely sexist temper and but ends up being advised by Sophia (Marieta Severo), her mother-in-law, to be understanding. Behind Sophia's demureness, which is just a facade, hides an ambition for the lands of Josafá, where a depleted emerald mine has been discovered, in which neither he nor his granddaughter have the least interest in exploiting after a tragedy that causes Clara's father and son of Josafá, Jonas (Eucir de Souza) to perish. Sophia, a domineering, self-willed, cunning and false woman, plans a plan to get rid of Clara, eventually putting her daughter-in-law in a psychiatric clinic for 10 years.The second phase, set in the present time, presents Clara trying to escape from the psychiatric clinic, without understanding how she got there, but discovers she was the victim of a major coup.
