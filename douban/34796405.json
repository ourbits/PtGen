    "introduction": "Fernande, the daughter of poor parents, is very much dissatisfied with her lot in life and wants to get out where she can have some pleasure. She is a great flirt and has several men on the string. When the doctor comes to the house she works her wiles on him to such an extent that he asks for her hand in marriage. She accepts him but in her mind has no intention of giving up her other sweethearts. After her marriage she continues to meet them with the result that he discovers her unfaithfulness. He looks in her private correspondence and finds proof that she has been utterly unfaithful. When he taxes her with it she does not deny it but tells him that she intends to continue the same way. He in a rage strikes her. Driven nearly insane he wanders round all night and on his return finds that she has gone away. He loses all trace of her and goes to a foreign country to try to forget her. In the meantime she goes to Paris, where she sets up a little court of her own.",
