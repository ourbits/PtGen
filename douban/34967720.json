    "introduction": "The video begins with band members getting in their jeep and the Gorillaz logo. Murdoch starts the car and begins to drive along a winding highway, while at the same time performing tricks such as driving on the rear or right wheels. Soon the highway turns into a dead loop - just at the chorus that Noodle performs, and then the bridge ends completely, which, however, does not scare Murdoch. He turns on a turbo mode, and the jeep flies through the gap. The clip, created by Jamie Hewlett and Pete Candeland, was animated using both 2D and 3D animations.",
