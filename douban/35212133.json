    "introduction": "入围2020年华沙电影节自由精神单元Don Oscar, if he wanted, could have been the next Escobar, but instead he sits on the ruins of his decrepit little drug empire. And let’s face it, there is not much left to sit on. Only a handful of his most faithful guard still remain with him. An unpaid debt starts bringing consequences and a bag with the last hidden money passes from hand to hand, from dead to dead. Loyalty proves fickle as the death toll keeps mounting. Only one ending appears likely for Don Oscar… A black comedy about thugs who are neither first-, nor second-, nor even third-class criminals in the Colombian town of Tulua. As the director remarks, “it is neither Tarantino nor a drug lord story”. It’s a simple story about low-profile thugs, a story challenging every genre cliché and prejudice.",
