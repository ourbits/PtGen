    "introduction": "The Bible under the pillow, a meeting with a clergyman, a stay in a male monastery. Leaving for school in Bucharest – there are more homosexuals there after all? There are so many beautiful girls around, so maybe alcohol is to blame? Adi’s father hears plenty of ‘precious’ advice from his friends and acquaintances. It is impossible to hide a secret in a small community for long. Adi’s real drama takes place not in the doctor’s office where he is examined, not even near waste bins where he was beaten up, but at home, behind closed doors. ‘Better This Way’ is an example of small realism in Romanian cinema, where authors focus on the drama of an individual of non-heteronormative sexual orientation.",
