    "introduction": "Frank Buck and his native crew hunt the jungles of the Far East to capture wild animals for American zoos. Buck first traps a 300-pound python, then a Bird of Paradise. Buck comes on a baby armor-plated rhinocerous as it is being attacked by a tiger. Buck shoots the tiger to save the baby rhino, then amputates its mangled ear. Returning to camp, they find a 24-foot python, which they shoot out of a tree and bag with a net. To snare monkeys, Buck sets up a huge net and lures them with food such as tapioca. Next, Buck snares a sixteen-foot crocodile and another python, which had bitten and encoiled itself around his helper Ali. Buck then enters a deep Malaysian jungle to seek a tiger. With the use of a cage and the help of natives, he finally captures it.",
