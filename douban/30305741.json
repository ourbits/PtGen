    "introduction": "Recife, the hometown of football legend Rivaldo, is overrun by the 2014 World Cup, but also faces enormous social problems. This docume ntary provides a fascinating insight into the events...This film was commissioned by Casa de Cinema de Porto Alegre and Sport TV (the Globo sports channel) as part of a special series \"A Copa Passou Por Aqui\" (The World Cup Was Here), made by filmmakers based in each of the host cities. For 3 weeks, in June and July 2014, during the World Cup matches taking place in Recife, 4 or 5 camera crews went out under my supervision to get footage of what was happening around the city. I hope this short film will be an interesting time capsule of Brazil in the year 2014. It really does feel like that 7 X 1 was indeed a bad omen to everything else the country has been going through since.",
