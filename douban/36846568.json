    "introduction": "The synopsis introduces us to journalist Olga (played by Lucía Jiménez) and Javier, a university professor (played by Grao), who, while having dinner at home, hear the ring tone of a mobile phone belonging to Lucía, the cleaning lady (Romanillos), who has forgotten it in the house. When the woman answers it, she hears a man’s voice hurling threats of violence, and so she warns Lucía, who categorically denies that she is being abused… until she turns up in a plaster cast. The couple are plagued by serious doubts: should they come to the aid of this person who doesn’t want to be helped, or should they keep their noses completely out of her business?",
