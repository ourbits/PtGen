Sure, they drink away their problems, they might even have frequent domestics but down on the block it's all for one and one for all. Follow the adventures of the residents of the Sunnyvale Housing Commission in every-town Australia. They battle cops and they scam Centerlink, they even have the occasional threesome and swingers party, but once you're down with the crew in the hood then it's \" Sunnyvale for life\".",
