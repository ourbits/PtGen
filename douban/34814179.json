    "introduction": "Fran Healy invited music critic Wyndham Wallace (The Guardian, The Quietus, Uncut) to cover the Mexican shows of his band Travis and to document it in the form of a film. Plot twist: Wallace isn't exactly a fan of the band. In Healy's own words: \" I thought a documentary from this unusual angle would be a lot more interesting than one from a journalist who was a fan. As it turns out, I was right.\"Through a series of candid interviews with the band, passionate fans and other music journalists, Wyndham attempts to understand the reason for his resentment. What follows is an unexpected meditation on life, friendship and, ultimately, the power of music.",
