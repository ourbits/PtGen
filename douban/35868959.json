Everything goes smoothly for the first few days, with an uncomfortable atmosphere of seduction between the three of them, but nothing out of the ordinary. Then, one morning, Rodrigo sees Ana's name on the list of deaths from covid-19. Everyone thinks it's weird and believes it was just a mistake in the publication, but strange events start to happen around the house. Rodrigo is intrigued and starts a personal investigation to find out if Ana is really alive.",
