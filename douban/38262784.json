    "introduction": "Welcome to the Atlantis, a bar tucked away in Helsinki’s concrete-gray neighborhood, Itä-Pasila. Here, staff and regulars alike drift through life, grappling with their emotions. Among them is Kauri, a nomad and eternal optimist who has mastered the art of running away. This time, he thinks he has found the ultimate escape: a van, the open road, and a one-way ticket to Portugal. But on the night of his departure, the dream stalls: his van breaks down. To pay for the repairs, Kauri has no choice but to head back to the one place he tried to leave behind: the Atlantis Bar.",
