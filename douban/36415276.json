    "introduction": "Jeff Koons is considered one of the most influential, popular, and controversial artists of recent decades. Throughout his career, he has experimented with new approaches to readymades, tested the boundaries between high art and mass culture, challenged the limits of industrial production, and transformed the relationship between artists, celebrity culture, and the global market. He has also managed to elevate kitsch and pop, turning them into masterpieces like few visionary artists in recent history. Pappi Corsicato’s film is an intimate portrait of this polarizing figure, revealing the hidden dynamics behind the person, the artist, and the Koons brand.",
