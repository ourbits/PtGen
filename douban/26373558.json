Giraldo’s new film invites audiences to stop thinking in those terms through these five characters: Diego who spent 35 years in prison for robbery and murder; Laura, an artist contemplating suicide; Jesus, a street sweeper tired of his daily routine; Luis, a construction worker who is taking care of his ailing mother; and Piña, an alcoholic boxer seeking to step back into the ring.",
