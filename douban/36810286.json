Here, they can decide for themselves when to go to bed, if they feel like brushing their teeth, or do their homework. That's how it's been ever since their mother disappeared a year ago. But when their absent mother start to arouse suspicion from the school principal, the siblings devise a clever plan to avoid being discovered and sent to an orphanage: They will hire a housekeeper. When they choose the colorful Miss Nelly - a male housekeeper in a skirt and high heels - the plan changes completely.",
