    "introduction": "Due to our increased reliance on technology over the past 65 years, this film acknowledges that procedure is important, but focuses on the procedure of human thought rather than completely pre-planned execution. One of my main tenets in this film was \"do what you feel like\" - sometimes I'd go in a different direction, throw out what was done previously, all based on my emotional response to my most current iteration. When I needed something more, I searched and created until I found/made what I needed.",
