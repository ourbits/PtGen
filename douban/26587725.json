    "introduction": "In Romania, chemotherapy drugs are neither accessible free of charge, as required by law, nor can they be acquired in pharmacies. Many of the patients who try in one way or another to procure drugs, are helped by a real Network of people. The network members do not get any financial benefit from their participation in this 'trade'. The documentary follows the drugs route from one of the oldest pharmacies in Vienna (located near the Opera House) to the patient in Romania.",
