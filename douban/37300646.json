    "introduction": "In a forgotten village in Pingyao, Junior Ji, known as Xiao Ji, comes from a family of Feng Shui burial masters, a lineage steeped in tradition yet fading with time. As his father, once a respected master, grows too weak to work, he urges Xiao Ji to carry on the family craft. But Xiao Ji’s heart lies elsewhere—in the crumbling temples and ancient frescoes that few care to preserve. Traveling from village to village, he documents these fading artworks, a mission at odds with his family and China’s rapid urbanization.Determined to carve his path, he leaves home in search of work, but the urban world offers little solace. His failure to find a place in the modern city only deepens the rift between him and his family. Torn between the weight of tradition and the urgency of a disappearing past, Xiao Ji stands at a crossroads, unsure of where he truly belongs.",
