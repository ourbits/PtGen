    "introduction": "In July 2007 Daniel Johnston makes a highly acclaimed appearance at London’s Union Chapel, described by the Evening Standard as “nothing short of breath-taking”. Daniel delivers renditions of favourites from the breadth of his career, such as True Love Will Find You in the End, Walking the Cow and Some Things Last a Long Time. New songs such as Mean Girls… and Try to Love are introduced and there are some hitherto overlooked gems such as Go and Living Life.",
