As the group makes their way to the remote village, they encounter Prof (played by Kwadwo Nkansah) the only English-speaking resident of the village. They introduce themselves as missionaries looking for communities to assist and are well-received by the village and its people.They secretly search the community for the totem. After several failed attempts to steal the totem themselves because of the mysterious power it possesses, they decide to come clean to Prof with their intentions. Enticed by the wealth they promise, Prof enlists the help of Adwubi (played by Janet Brefo Yankson), the chief priest’s daughter who is already smitten with Frank.",
