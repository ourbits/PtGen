    "introduction": "The film consists of three, at first glance independent, stories and follows three situations developing simultaneously within a few days. Narrated parallel, they gradually reveal the connections between the members of a family and, at the same time, the disintegrated human communication between the characters - husbands and wives, brothers, parents, children. The threads of the separate events become interwoven so that at the end they are joined into a common, mutually connected and mutually dependent existence, branded by the lack of value and higher meaning. Sloth and inertia, suppressed spiritual impulses and torments are as concrete and tangible as the wind and their consequences are irreversible - a moment after which there is no time for \"later\". No one is innocent, no one is guilty and still each one of the characters is deeply shaken at the realization that he or she could have lived their days in a different way...",
