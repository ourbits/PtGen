    "introduction": "Entirely taken from an old Egyptian science fiction film called The Master of Time directed by Kamal el Sheikh in 1987, about an illuminated scientist wanting to extend human life, Threshold is built on the intuition that if the original film were emptied of all its fictional elements, retaining only the transition shots featuring doors, gates, and boundary crossings, it would reveal its quintessence: its obsession with eternity. Despite the plot being evacuated from the film, enough of the fiction seeps in for the viewer to grasp the narrative threads. The viewer joins the main character Mr. Kamel in becoming stuck in both space and time, thus fulfilling the scientist's prophecy.",
