    "introduction": "African born, Interpol inspector, Masinga Luthuli is dispatched to Southern Africa to repatriate a group of female Ukrainian teenagers, sex trafficked by Russian underworld figures operating in Maputo. Here he encounters Xia, an Asian influencer whose stance against her country’s plundering of Africa’s minerals and wildlife make her a prize for the nefarious pursuits of the antagonist Jeremiah Mills who believes her ascending spirit will empower his control over the Asian consortium bidding on the purchase of rear earth minerals from corrupt officials.源自：https://ccadiff.ukzn.ac.za/diff44/masinga-the-calling/",
