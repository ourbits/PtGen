    "introduction": "To earn money and send it for his family in a nearby city, Jomeh, a young boy, and his friend collect the metal wastes remaining from the wartime. They live together on an abandoned ship in the middle of a river, and there is an obvious allusion to Huckleberry Finn at work. When a suitor asks for Jomeh's sister's hand, he decides to provide dowry for her and volunteers to pass through a minefield to collect more scrap metal. 'Shrapnel in Peace' is a fine and timely statement on the devastating aftermath of modern warfare. The images in this film are stark and stunning. Depicting a purgatorial landscape somewhere between neo-realism and Beckett, this poetical yet emotionally charged feature is a must for cinema lovers.",
