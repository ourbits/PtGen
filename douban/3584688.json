    "introduction": "Excellent documentary, don't let this unseeing! I saw this film in December 2001, when Argentina collapsed in bankrupt. Then I had understood a LOT of things related to external doubt and how politicians are so corrupted. The research showed here will introduce you one of the latest Argentinean patriots. Alejandro Olmos. He just fought to clarify an illegal and fraudulent situation in the years of military government. By seeing this film you will open your eyes to a hided world of conspiracy and hand over. Till today [2008] this issue is under the table in Argentinean congress...Take your own conclusions.",
