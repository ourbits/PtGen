    "introduction": "Bunker77 is the wild true story of a young American rebel seeking freedom, love, and authenticity in a chaotic world. Bunker Spreckels, Clark Gable's stepson and heir to a sugar fortune, defied expectations and grew into a controversial surf star from the late 60s into the 70s. He pushed surfing's boundaries by riding very short boards in Hawaii's most critical waves as well as during a pioneering trip to South Africa's J-Bay. While Bunker mentored skateboard legend Tony Alva to his world championship and dove into collaborations with film auteur Kenneth Anger, his mysterious and surreal persona blazed to uncontainable proportions.",
