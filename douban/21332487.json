    "introduction": "\"I Want My Father Back\" is a film on the suicide of farmers in Vidarbha. Vidarbha is in the eastern region of the state of Maharashtra in India. The film looks at the reasons behind these suicides, beginning with the fall-out of the Green Revolution, the changing traditional methods of farming (especially with regard to seeds), the globalization process, the debt-loan trap faced by farmers, and the devastating effects of Bt. seeds. The film speaks in favor of organic farming and ultimately shows that the death of the farmer also means the death of the soil.",
