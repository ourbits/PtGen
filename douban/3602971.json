    "introduction": "Daydreams is regarded by many as Bauer's surviving masterpiece. Film historian and archivist Paolo Cherchi Usai describes it as \"a masterful balance between subject technique and narrative development. The tension in the plot (reminding one of Hitchcock's Vertigo) reaches its climax in the extraordinary tracking shot during which the camera quite literally follows the main character along a deserted street, stops when he stops, then tracks back slowly, while he retraces his route. Necrophilia, mysticism and abstraction are the main ingredients of a tale with an astonishing and eerie finale.\"",
