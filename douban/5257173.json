    "introduction": "Living in a trashcan, O.Ratz and his pal Dave D. Fly try to find warmth on a cold winter night. After several attempts fail - including being thrown out of a homeless shelter and crushed by a snowplow with a freshly warmed blanket attached to it, O.Ratz and Dave stumble upon an old space heater and plug it in. Unfortunately, newspapers too close to the heater cause an electrical fire leading to a gas explosion, sailing them off into the sky to possibly an even colder destination.",
