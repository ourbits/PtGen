While they are driving through the bush, Sam distracts Kelly, causing her to swerve off the road and hit a kangaroo. Over the next few days, he is haunted by the dead marsupial, who quickly becomes his confidant.Eager to help his struggling mum, Sam only creates further chaos at home through his well-intentioned efforts. When a mishap involving a football sparks a confrontation between the two of them, it forces both to confront their unvoiced feelings of grief and frustration.Through a blend of horror, humour and poignant moments, Roadkill explores Sam’s coming to terms with the guilt he feels surrounding his parents’ divorce.",
