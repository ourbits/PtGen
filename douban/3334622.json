    "introduction": "智利当代著名导演Andrés Wood（《足球故事》《马丘卡》）08年的最新作。Chilean director Andres Wood's \"La Buena Vida\" (\"The Good Life\"), a story about life in Santiago, won the top award at the 34th Iberian-American film festival in the southern Spanish town of Huelva, the organisers said. \"La Buena Vida\", which won the Colon de Oro award, tells the story of four people whose lives cross in the Chilean capital Santiago.With the inner city and a subjective film, the Chilean director Andres Wood returns once again to captivate viewers. The fifth delivery from the director of the successful Machuca and Stories of Football enters the world of relationships and affections of the anonymous characters circulating Santiago de Chile. Work, love, loneliness, death and the different dreams that move us are the key themes of a film that seeks to provide a more humane and profound view of Chilean society today. The Good Life recounts the story of Teresa, Edmundo, Mario and Patricia; although none of them will get what they expect, something will happen.Andrés Wood is a Chilean film director born in 1965. He is most famous for the films Historias de Fútbol / Soccer Stories (1997), La Fiebre del Loco/ Loco Fever (2002), his most well known film Machuca (2004) and his most recent La Buena Vida/ The Good Life (2008).Wood is a Chilean of Irish and Scottish descent. He was educated at a private English school in Santiago. He graduated as an economist from the Catholic University of Chile in 1988. In 1991 he studied at the New York University Film School.",
