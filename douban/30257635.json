    "introduction": "The young reporter Madeline - in search of her first big story - is set by her boss on a very special case. In the city of Bad Weissbach there is an unsolved series of murders for 15 years, about which she has to report. At present the case is up to date again. Nothing is known about the culprit, except that the person has long blond hair, is dressed all in black and you only hear the voice of a woman. No face, no DNA, the police is already in the dark for a very long time. On the spot, she meets Ben Wagner, a young commissioner who has made it a personal mission to kill the \"phantom\" - as the killer is called by the inhabitants. Initially, the rather cold commissioner is not thrilled to have an inexperienced reporter by his side, but soon they will go together on a dangerous mission that will push them to the limit of their potential and let's them uncover the horrible truth behind the PHANTOM .",
