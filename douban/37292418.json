    "introduction": "Eva perceives herself differently. An unexpected event transforms her. Her female universe put under tension, sustaining the unsustainable in the family structure. From that night on, everything will be different for her, even if nothing changes.A contained film, even an enclosed one -the untimely nighttime departure is another enclosure, another circle-, The Night without Me is presented with the evidence of a nightmare—not of the frontally macabre kind, but one of another order: the nightmare that reveals itself in something that is out of place, with some other element that insists with its disturbing and recurrent power, with the certainty -experienced with uneasiness- that those around are not even aware of their contribution to a progressive downfall. The protagonist, the film’s absolute center, is centripetal and centrifugal, and Natalia Oreiro plays her with these and other complexities, with the subtle evidence of the poise and grace of true film actresses.",
