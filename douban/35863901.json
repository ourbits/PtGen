    "introduction": "The Will Of Victory A Doc Opera is proof that 'the reality' is stronger than fiction if approached with imagination. It shows us real images but tell us a very powerful visual imaginary story that builds up and makes you feel that you're there. That's the power of the film. The impact is very emotional. Also the fact that we only chose color images gave the film a consistency that this generation hasn't seen. We treated the images to feel like dailies just shot yesterday. The Second World War is so embedded in our brain as B&W that The Will Of Victory makes us feel that it has happened during our life instead of before. Almost all the images that we saw of this time were in B&W, which made us; the ones who were born afterwards see the WAR always as something of our parents. Growing up we were and wanted to be detached from it. Now after 60 years we are thrown back into the 'real' thing, by approaching the real images with so much imagination, no dialog and no narration for a new generation.",
