    "introduction": "Frost crafts a fizzy, upbeat ode to the now 92-year-old Quant, exploring her importance as a female business pioneer, her influence on gender politics through women’s dress and her impact on a decade of fashion. Drawing on an exceptional pop cultural archive and including a glittering array of contributors, from Edward Enninful to Kate Moss, Vivienne Westwood and Dave Davies, the film explores Quant’s significant legacy and the ways in which her work signposted the future; asking questions about fast fashion and mass production, and her contribution to pop culture’s obsession with marketing people as brands. A film powered by female ingenuity, both in front of and behind the camera, along with 1960s pop hits and a vibrant dayglow archive, Quant brims with London vim. We’re over the moon to present its World Premiere at LFF.",
