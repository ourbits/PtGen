    "introduction": "Anamika, whose mother is Indian and father is English, returns to care for her mother who is suffering from dementia. But the mother-daughter relationship is not an easy one. When her mother was younger she was a promising singer, but a series of unexpected situations, including a move to the United Kingdom, an unplanned pregnancy, and raising a daughter alone, have made her emotional and stubborn. White-skinned Anamika used to lie about being adopted, and the wounds she received from her mother after her father died when she was ten have become a trauma. The time left for them to shake off the long shadows and reconcile with each other is too short. As her mother’s illness worsens, Anamika must prepare herself for medical and legal issues as well as her career and what lies ahead. With a meticulously crafted script this film shows the change in their relationship through dialogue.",
