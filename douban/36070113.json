    "introduction": "The film documents the live report on US television about the so-called \"McDonald's massacre\" in San Diego on July 18, 1984. In the opposite cut, documentary material from the Vietnam War is set to draw a parallel to the cause of the rampage. The bloody deed of an individual turns out to be the spiritual and moral result of the war through which the former soldier became what he is now.",
