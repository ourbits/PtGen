Directed by Chris Atkins, the BAFTA-nominated director of the documentary Taking Liberties, it shows the Starsuckers production team planting a variety of celebrity-related stories in the UK media, such as a claim that Avril Lavigne had been seen asleep in a nightclub. A variety of tabloid newspapers accepted the stories without corroboration or evidence.It will launch as part of the British Film Institute's 53rd Film Festival.",
