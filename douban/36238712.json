    "introduction": "A Muslim family in Lucknow, in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, find themselves sheltering in their home as worshippers from a nearby Hindu temple go on a religiously-driven rampage. As violence consumes their neighbours and authorities seem unwilling to help, fear causes simmering resentments to push each person into making bad decisions. As the night wears on, one question overshadows everything: will they survive the savagery that threatens to knock down their door?Written, produced and directed by Alok Kumar DWIVEDI, “Hurdang” is a siege movie where the din of frenzied violence echoes the intercommunal riots that have rocked Gujarat at different times, particularly in 2002 where thousands of civilians, many of whom were Muslim, were massacred and property was demolished.",
