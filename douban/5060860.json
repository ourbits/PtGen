    "introduction": "Dying in the trenches during World War II, Stefan looks back at his own life and that of his father. Through his memories, the film presents a story that embraces two generations and various eras. It is a film about the tragedy of lives dragged into conflicts against their will, of lives violently ruined or ended – a story about the devastating consequences of war. Interweaving past and present, the flashback narrative depicts the war as a perpetual situation where the „little people” always turn out to be on the losing side.Iulian Mihu and Manole Marcus’s feature debut is a poetic and pacifist work, relying on a cinematographic vision that is similar to the artistic-political programmes of „new waves” emerging across Europe around the same time. The film fell victim of censorship because its multi-layered temporal structure, expressionist imagery, unconventional narrative form and anti-war message did not fit with the socialist-realist paradigm that prevailed in Romania, as well as in other Eastern European countries, in the 1950s.Digitised from the 35mm original negative by Abis Studio in 2011. The 35mm original negative is preserved by the Romanian Film Archive.",
