    "introduction": "Trying to describe the “plot” of A Hunting Day is not only hard, but futile. Its grace lays precisely in its unforeseeable, absurd quality, at times exceedingly so. Prior to their cinematographic existence, these camouflaged characters, or “the blondes”, were born in fertile scenic experiences, emanating from the Krapp Group. In the film, of course, Tati and Chaplin function as an aim, and so does the idea to make a non-verbal cinema, completely physician and visual, non-discursive. Without a plot, or rather with one that is thinned to a child’s level, exploring the limits of choreography in filmmaking. A script-less kind of cinema, in which we have no idea of what will happen in the following shot. A cinema of the present in the purest sense, which knows not of the future or the past.",
