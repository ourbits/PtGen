    "introduction": "In this two-hour special event, filmed at Bafta, Melvyn Bragg is joined by some of British television's key figures from the last 60 years to look at the extraordinary impact British television has made since its first great unifying moment - the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.Through a series of short, archive-based films and studio discussion, Bragg and his guests examine the way television has brought the world to us, and has both reflected and influenced who we are as a nation.The programme analyses how television has contributed to social change, challenged authority, covered war and natural disaster, broken down reserve, redefined celebrity and democratised. The programme also asks how broadcast television can continue to thrive in a fast-changing world.Studio interviewees include Ken Loach, Joan Bakewell, Trevor Phillips, Michael Grade, Martha Kearney, Ed Balls, Lyse Doucet and Alex Crawford.",
