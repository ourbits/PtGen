    "introduction": "\"We were against technique, art, meticulous framing and all that. That was our point of view. I was interested in conveying an idea. The form it took did not matter. Later they said: 'That's not cinema. That's not art. It's horrible!'. But that's precisely what we liked about it.\" - Luis Bunuel\"Cineastes de notre temps\" focuses on Luis Bunuel, surrealist filmmaker, his exile and his early career. Luis Bunuel Portoles (February 22, 1900 – July 29, 1983) was a Spanish filmmaker who worked mainly in Mexico and France, but also in his native country and the United States. He is considered one of the most important directors in the history of cinema.",
