    "introduction": "Film about Teresa Wilms Montt's life. Focuses on the life of Chilean poetess Teresa Wilms Montt (1893-1921).Chilean video director and producer Tatiana Gaviola has been an influential figure in the development of her country's audiovisual productions. Her work alternates between documentary and avant-garde. Although she was originally trained to become a filmmaker at the School of Communications Arts at the Catholic University of Chile, where she graduated in 1979, Gaviola turned to video as it gave her more freedom from the political constraints and budgetary limitations imposed on feature filmmmakers after the 1973 military coup. Gaviola's videos have been produced by every major film studio in Chile. Many of her videos center around the political struggles of women, but she also produces works about historical issues. Her work has been shown throughout Europe and North America. In addition to video-making, she also takes part in international workshops for feminist collectives.",
