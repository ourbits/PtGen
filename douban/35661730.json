He is peeved with his son Shiva (Gopichand) and even his family members are unhappy with him, as he roams around listlessly without doing any job and instead getting into unwanted quarrels all the time. Things get complicated when a powerful don Kashi (Abhimanyu Singh) the most feared in the city, enters into their lives. Where this leads to and how the beautiful girl Nayana (Nayanatara) is connected to it, forms the story.",
