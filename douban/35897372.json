    "introduction": "American Chick is inspired by the life story of a woman, called Ema Černá in the film, whom the director met during his period of homelessness and who tries to carry on living her life against all odds. Černá goes through an orphanage, foster care and a detention centre. She endures the ordeals – including bullying and beatings – driven by the desire to meet her father, who supposedly lives in the USA (she was born there and was brought to Czechoslovakia at the age of nine by her mother, who then abandoned her). The director calls American Chick “a probe into the history of the Czechoslovakia of the 1980s and 1990s” and “a contemporary drama about freedom, ostracism and the desire to live”.The theatrical version centres on childhood, while the film will follow the protagonist through different moments in her life, into the present day. However, the stigma that the protagonist bears continues to have an influence on her life. The dream of finding her father in the USA is vanishing, and she has to learn to come to terms with her own faults and accept her fate.",
