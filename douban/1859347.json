    "introduction": "The show was heavily publicized, with a press release by a \"Dr. Roland Kapferer PhD\" claiming amongst other things that \"Christie's use of such a device reflects the notions of Embedded Commands and Phonological Ambiguity used in Neuro-Linguistic Programming\" and \"the combinatorial structure of a Christie novel creates physiochemical responses in the reader\". This was widely reported-upon in the press. An investigation by The Guardian's \"Bad Science\" columnist, Ben Goldacre, revealed that Roland Kapferer PhD, a philosopher working in anthropology and art theory, was the writer and associate producer of the show.",
