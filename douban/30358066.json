One day, they are hired by a wealthy man, Mr Balboa, a grandfather who has attempted to shield his wife from pain by means of faked letters that claim to be from their grandson who left home twenty years previously, portraying him as a good, upstanding citizen, when in fact he is just the opposite. The actors visit the elderly couple for a week’s break, pretending to be the grandson and his wife, but events take a turn for the worst when they are joined by an unexpected guest.",
