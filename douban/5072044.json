    "introduction": "Following the shooting death of \"socialite sportsman\" Romney P. Patterson, Charmaine Patterson, his French wife, is arrested for his murder. Selected to serve on the jury at her trial are J. Clarence \"Pudgy\" Beaver, a tippling, timid real estate promoter, and his former high school classmate, the wealthy Mrs. Agnes Dean. During the trial, Agnes and Pudgy disrupt proceedings and aggravate Judge Henry Prime with their impromptu questioning of the witnesses, which include the Patterson's maid, Clara Simpson. Clara testifies that after she heard the fatal gunshots, she found Charmaine at her husband's side muttering, \"Why did I do it?\" According to Clara, Charmaine also offered her a bribe to say nothing to the police, an accusation Charmaine loudly denies. Suspicious of Clara's statements, Agnes inquires about Patterson's will and discovers that, after Charmaine, his cousin, Thomas Jeffrey, who was with him just before the murder, would inherit his estate. Later in the jury room, foreman B. J. Martin launches into an immediate vote, and all but Agnes vote \"guilty\". Convinced of the ex-chorus girl's innocence, Agnes, casually gatheringinnocence, Agnes, casually gathering information about the other jurors, manipulates their prejudices and slowly sways a majority of them to vote \"not guilty.\" After an uncomfortable night in a hotel, however, several of these jurors express apprehension about an acquittal. To prevent a turnaround, Agnes tricks Officer Clark into passing a note to her maid, Antoinette, and requests that the jury go to the Pattersons' to re-enact the crime. With Pudgy's assistance, the jurors establish that Charmaine could not have murdered her husband according to Clara's testimony. Antoinette then returns with a message from the chief of detectives concerning the time that Jeffrey, who has secretly married Clara, arrived home following the murder, which clearly mplicates him in the crime. Agnes, having proven to her peers that Jeffrey killed Patterson and conspired with Clara to frame Charmaine, happily concludes her civic duty.",
