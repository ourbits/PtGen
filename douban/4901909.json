    "introduction": "At sunrise five people meet on a highrise rooftop in order to leap to their deaths. Five completely different mind sets. None of them knows about the other as to why they want to terminate their lives so abruptly. They don't even know each other's names. The only bond that ties them together in a tragic and bizarre way is knowing that at any minute they are about to jump. But a chain reaction of absurd situations is unfolding forcing them to spend a whole day waiting up on the roof until sundown. They are stranded on an island, their own parallel universe surrounded by and cut off from the hustle of the city. Initial dislike and rejection of one another eventually turns into an unforeseen alliance. All five of them experience a day they won't ever forget.",
