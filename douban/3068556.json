    "introduction": "Bizarre, minimalistic and surreal story that's happening somewhere in the postapocalyptic future.The lead is a 'sounds of nature' tape collector.The story is based on the relationship of three people with a question is it love possible after the tragedy which they experienced. They are trying to rebuild their lives after the tragic event.Lukas Nola was born in Zagreb, in 1964. He graduated from Academy of Dramatic Art in Zagreb, film and TV directing. He is a theater, film and TV director (...)Croatian director Lukas Nola \"Alone\" (Sami) was presented with best direction award at the 48th annual Pula Film Festival. Best camera went to Mirko Pivcevic! in Alone and Ana Savic-Gecan received the best costumes award for Alone.There was a Croatian film that did use characters living on the fringes of society. However, Lukas Nola's visually stunning but otherwise vacuous Sami (Alone, 2001) has metaphysical pretensions rather than the intent of direct social or political commentary and as such stands slightly apart from the other films from the former Yugoslavia...(from: A Report on the 48th Pula Film Festival and the current state of the Croatian film industry by Andrew James Horton)",
