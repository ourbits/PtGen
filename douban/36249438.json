    "introduction": "A drama series about the conflict between past and future, tradition and progress, self-fulfillment and family values. In a Bukharan community we see the struggles between the older generation that wants a traditional life in Bukhara, Uzbekistan and the new generation that wants to build a new life in a new country. The series takes place precisely at the crisis point between the old generation and ancient traditions and the new generation and the 21st century. The series includes biographical elements of the two lead actors--the grandmother in the series is played by their actual grandmother.",
