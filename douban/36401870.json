    "introduction": "In the midst of California's coastal redwood region, Green Diamond Resource Company continues to clearcut redwood forests, devastating habitats and leaving scars across the land. Farmer, a direct action environmental activist in his late 20s, decides to tree-sit in the McKay Tract -- a 60-acre grove of ancient redwoods that is home to spotted owls, deer, flying squirrels, and countless other life forms. AMONG GIANTS begins three years into the McKay tree-sit. On his tiny platform a hundred feet up in the ancient redwood canopy, Farmer must battle the elements and avoid isolation as he fights for a sustainable future. The film uses a verite style that reflects the pace of life in the tree village and shows the forest from Farmer's perspective. As Farmer outlasts a vicious storm, counts the rings on a felled tree, and trumps through a recent clear cut, the film questions what it means to make personal sacrifices for a larger cause, and how a single person can affect real change in the world.",
