    "introduction": "Sang-yeon, Cheong-gook and Woo-seok are childhood friends who are now trying to find their own way of life. College student Sang-yeon, soon to start his military service, is busy with classes and a part-time job. Cheong-gook, who works at a club while dreaming about becoming a musician, has trouble with loan sharks. Woo-seok, who tries hard to be a police officer, is occupied with preparing for the examination. These three friends all have their own issues to deal with but there’s some awkwardness that makes them hesitate to share their stories. Dodari simply portrays youths who are going through transitions; it also presents the hardships of social barriers and changing friendships. Director Park Joon-bum, who was born and grew up in Busan, skillfully shows his hometown with a Busan accent. The scene where Sang-yeon, out on a vacation from his military service, watches a lighthouse where he used to hang out with his friends shows the director’s way of accepting changes in friendships and real life. (LEE Sang-yong)",
