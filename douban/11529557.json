    "introduction": "Collider tells the story of six people transported to a post-apocalyptic 2018, where they have to fight to discover how they got there, how to survive, and how to get back to the present.The story focuses on a young scientist Peter, who sabotages CERN laboratories Hadron Collider when his credibility is wrongfully destroyed. By doing so he accidentally transports himself via a wormhole to a world ruined by natural disasters and at war with the Unknown. He brings with him five people who have ‘jumped’ from different times and different places, but who each hold vital clues needed to return back to their present times. Peter keeps getting flashbacks and a sense of deja-vu linked to the future. If he’s right then he has just 36 hours to figure out a way to get to CERN, reverse the wormhole and prevent the apocalypse because when the clock runs out so does Earth’s existence.",
