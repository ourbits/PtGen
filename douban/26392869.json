    "introduction": "A spotted egg is screened, so we can see a blurred shape inside. The shape begins to move. It bounces against the egg shell. Some of the egg shell spots are transformed to eyes and a mouth. We see the egg's face react on the movement inside. The egg tries to defend itself from being broken by the growing and more and more aggressive shape. A mortal combat begins.Script, direction, design, animation: Martin SchmidtRigging: Mike Best, Marcus FeistSound Design: Tobias BöhmMusic: Klangerfinder, Florian KäpplerFunding: MFG Baden-Württembergand Hessische FilmförderungCo production: Martin SchmidtProduction: Thomas Meyer-HermannStudio FILM BILDER, 2013",
