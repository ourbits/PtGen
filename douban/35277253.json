    "introduction": "1618 is a detailed, splendid, richly dramatized and designed historical drama, and its protagonist is the entire Sephardic community of the Portuguese city of Oporto. It is the 17 century, and as the Inquisition continues to persecute the Portuguese Jews, it sends Visitador Sebastião Noronha to the region. António Álvares, a family man and a member of his community, will become the biggest obstacle to Noronha’s actively Antisemitic plans. Álvares will do it not by fighting evil with evil, but by creating an escape plan for all those who are in danger because of who they are.1618 is an important project initiated by the Jewish community of Oporto, which turned its past into a gripping historical film. The film’s main action unfolds in places similar to those existing at the time that has meanwhile been destroyed. Many characters actually existed in real life and took part in the facts as narrated in the film.",
