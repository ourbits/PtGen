    "introduction": "Seventeen year old Alex Taylor (Richard Harmon) dreams of flying. He also dreams of running for his high school's cross-country track team. Both dreams seem equally out of reach as Alex has been blind since the age of two. Alex, determined to run, practices with his father, Probation Officer Geoff Taylor. Geoff, with additional girth and age working against him, finds that he no longer can keep up with his son, a gifted runner. He must find a running partner at the school fast enough to help Alex make the cross-country team. This help comes from the unlikeliest of sources. Brad Coleman (Jaren Brandt Bartlett), a schoolmate of Alex's, spends most of his time running from the law. Brad is caught in a pathetic daytime robbery attempt and faces incarceration for repeat offenses. Geoff makes a deal to keep Brad out of jail and back in school. He pairs the two boys, opposite in many ways, together. And despite a rocky start because of their many differences, an unlikely friendship forms.",
