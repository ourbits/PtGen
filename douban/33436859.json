Dubbed the Fallen Angels, it was the official opinion of the FBI the four had voluntarily run from their former lives. A recent petition through the Freedom of Information Act has forced the government to release all of the evidence they collected during their investigation, including footage from a VR180 camera. For the first time the public will see what happened to the Angels on their last night on Earth.",
