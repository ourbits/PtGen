    "introduction": "Berthe is a young woman who was traumatised by an event in her childhood, and she lives locked in her room, silent and alienated. One day, a doctor decides to re-establish contact between her and other people. But he treats her as though she were one of Pavlov's dogs, and after an \"arranged\" marriage to a dissolute individual, she suffers a second crisis and is once again locked up.\"This difficult story is translated to the screen in a very pure, introspective way. Claire Wauthion acts splendidly in a virtually silent role and the film deservedly won the acclaim, and an award, at Namur, where everyone declared that Berthe marked a new and significant step forward in the career of Patrick Ledoux.\" (Paul Davay. 1978 International Film Guide)",
