    "introduction": "Plot Outline: This TV Movie is about the Tehran Conference between FDR, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin. It shows the interaction between the three leaders at the close of the Second World War.Trivia: This production was the first to be filmed expressly for broadcast in the high-definition television (HDTV) format.Goofs: Errors made by characters (possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers): During the dinner at the Teheran Conference, Stalin tells Churchill that in Britain there are two parties, while in the Soviet Union there is only one. In fact, Churchill's Coalition government included three major parties, not two: Churchill's own Conservatives, Clement Atlee's Labour Party, and Sir Archibald Sinclair's Liberal Party. Both were in the Cabinet: Atlee was Lord Privy Seal and member of the War Cabinet; Sinclair was Secretary of State for Air.Awards: Won Emmy. Another 1 win & 8 nominations",
