    "introduction": "Violet and Stella spend idyllic summers at camp and the beach. As time passes, personalities and bodies evolve in this thoughtful and elegiac indie drama about the everlasting bond of female friendship. Following the girls’ formative years from ages 9 through 13, we observe intimate details of their lives together and apart on vacations in New England and at home in California. At times, they struggle with body image, peer pressure, social awkwardness, and parental bonds. Yet at the end of the day, the girls have each other to lean on. Based on writer Sianni Rosenstock and director/co-writer Sophia Silver’s own childhood bond, this charming tale of sisterhood conjures up memories of contemporary classics Beaches (1988) and Now and Then (1995). Recommended for ages 11 and up.",
