    "introduction": "黑山著名导演尼科里奇的代表作之一。1985年莫斯科国际电影节银奖。The peace of a small fishing village is shattered by the coming of a young, and stunningly beautiful, wife of a local guest-worker. She intends to live in her father's house, which in the mean-time became a pub. From that moment her revenge begins, toying with to people, their passions and interests. This comic-erotic dimension a lyric element is added, her relation to a local musician. That relation, and the life of the whole village, ends in tragedy.Another Zivko Nikolic masterpiece! A brilliant, fluently told piece made by the Montenegrin movie wizard Zivko Nikolic. It is about inhabitants of a village in patriarchal part of Montenegro which undergo serious events which are to change their lives forever. Stories are different one from another but although having the same patriarchal vs. modern crush thing in them, the most common particles contained are the building of a channel between a lake at which the village is placed and the nearby sea, by some local architects wanting to gain money from the business which is going to burst out after the village becomes harbor and the coming of a young woman from America to the village resulting conflicts among the peasants attracted by her, and many other sympathetic inconveniences.",
