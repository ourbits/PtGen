    "introduction": "The daily life of vereda caretaker Santino and his family in the basin of the São Francisco River, in Minas Gerais. Veredas are very humid vegetation formations that supply water to the fauna and soil of the Brazilian Cerrado. In addition to being a tireless activist in defense of this biome that is very threatened by the predators of big business, Santino manages to suggestively unite the spiritual and mystical world to which he is linked, the world of nature and the animals with which he confabulates, and the world of political activism, raising the awareness of new generations about the importance of preserving nature.源自：http://etudoverdade.com.br/en/filme/51399-Santino",
