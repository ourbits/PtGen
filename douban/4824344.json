    "introduction": "A prison with one million inmates. That's how the people of the Gaza Strip regard their land. Gaza is an area of 288 square kilometers surrounded by an electric fence. Lacking natural resources and being one of the poorest places on earth -- Gaza is dependent on its ties with Israel -- its enemy. Made by an Israeli and Palestinian crew, CLOSE, CLOSED, CLOSURE shows the nerve-racking process of getting people in and out, and the growing frustration and deprivation of the local population, amongst the reasons for the \"second intifada\" and the present-day blood bath. The film also presents the different Israeli standpoints -- right wingers who consider the occupation legitimate, and doves who are willing to give up the occupied territories as part of a peace treaty. Questions raised by the director are interspersed with comments from Palestinians and confrontations between settlers and Israeli pacifists. The film asks: In this never ending conflict, where the spilled blood makes every stone a symbol -- where every image is fraught with meaning -- is it possible to see and hear things as they are?",
