    "introduction": "This is actually a 'straight-to-TV' film made shortly before the war in B&H begun. It is a common story about Sarajevan thieves who used to travel across Western Europe and rob houses. It was a whole sub-culture in the city, with places where they gathered, socialized, gambled, made business deals etc.In this story we have three thieves with different backgrounds: one is married with children, the second one is living with his lover and the third one is in love with a beautiful, ordinary girl whose parents disapprove her relationship with 'that criminal'. All three of them have their own personal problems they have to resolve during the New Year holidays. But there are also jealous rival criminals, cops who hate them, unreasonable parents, snitches, runaway-lovers, taxi drivers without loyalty, prostitutes who dream about better life and many other characters who vividly depict the society in Sarajevo at the beginning of the 90's.This is one of only two or three movies made by the late Benjamin Filipovic, a real icon of the city and a very talented director (PLEASE see his last and the only feature film, Well Tempered Corpses), who managed to tell a story about regular people who are in rather irregular business, just trying to survive and to have better life. And that is enough to make a really good movie with a lot of funny (some are even nowadays legendary) quotes and situations.",
