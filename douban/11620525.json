    "introduction": "Series 3 (2002)The third and final series focused on a different character each week but with the overlaps creating a more complex layering of the plot, more akin to a one-off episode of a situation comedy (albeit with intertwined plots) than a traditional sketch show. The end of each episode features a white van swerving to avoid a pedestrian and crashing into a garden wall. Some residents escape unharmed, while others are not so lucky. A red plastic bag is seen being blown by the wind through the town in every episode, indicating that all the stories occur simultaneously. This is the only series that does not include a laughter track.",
