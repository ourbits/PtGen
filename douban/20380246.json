    "introduction": "Herbert von Karajan famously professed, \"Those who have achieved all their aims probably set them too low.\" A swirling mélange of previously unreleased footage and private recordings, Eric Schulz’s vibrant documentary applauds the brilliant orchestra conductor’s swashbuckling private life and creative ambition, delves into his exacting creative process, and questions what his legacy might ultimately be. For fans and novices alike, the excerpts from private recordings of phone calls between the maestro and his sound engineer Guenter Hermanns, exclusively analyzed for Schulz’s fillm, provide fascinating insight into Karajan’s working method and inimitable style.",
