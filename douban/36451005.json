He tells her that the pictures are fabricated and that he is blackmailed by the Wolf's gang who are terrorizing the ultra-Orthodox community. Unfortunately for Battie this is only partially true. Lazer is indeed blackmailed but he is also indeed gay. Both are going to fight Wolf's gang in a journey that will test their love and faith and change their lives forever.",
