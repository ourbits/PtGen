    "introduction": "In front of old plastic advertising posters on which are drawn in giant format the big icons of luxury and consumerism that make up their shelters, refugee children stand like kings. Symbols of life at the heart of war, fragility and death, these children are shown by Jocelyne Saab as precious notes of hope in the heart of a dehumanized world. Shot in the Syrian refugee camp of Bekaa, this work also resulted in a series of painted photographs.",
