    "introduction": "This is a great docudrama about the legends of Floripes, an enchanted moor of Olhão, in the Algarve. Enchanted moors are one of the cornerstones of Portuguese mythology, they are often seductive and temptresses, foreigners that can offer a powerful reward, but also a terrible curse.Left in Portugal during the Reconquista while her family went back to North Africa, beautiful Floripes was condemned to roam her ancient kingdom in the Algarve until a man could undo her curse. Then she would marry him and give him her fabulous treasure. But if the man fails, she must eat his heart.Along with the staging of alleged contacts from the fishermen of Olhão with Floripes, we are treated with interviews with the locals - what they know about the legends, do they fear her, do they desire her, do they believe in her? This results in a very fascinating social documentary about the psychology of the locals.Not to be missed if you like the supernatural or local folklore, and especially if you are visiting the Algarve, particularly Olhão.",
