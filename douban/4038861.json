    "introduction": "Rwanda, a small country in the heart of Africa, was the scene in 1994 of the last genocide of the 20th century: in only 100 days, almost 1 million people were killed. By the end of that year, the UN established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, with the aim of judging the perpetrators, amongst them priests, journalists, artists and political leaders. Argentine judge Inés Weinberg de Roca is the only representative from Latin America in this multicultural tribunal, which calls judges from all over the world. A documentalist team traveled to Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda to interview judges, prosecutors, defenders, accused and survivors, and to accompany judge Inés Weinberg de Roca in her first official visit to the country where the African Holocaust took place. The prints of the massacre are present in this documentary where the awesome beauty of Rwanda contrasts with this moving human story.",
