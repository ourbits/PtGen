    "introduction": "If You See My Mother is a romantic, honest, and touching French comedy — all the kinds of things one wants from a romantic comedy that refuses to be guided by its genre tropes. 30-year-old Max is a single ophthalmologist who appears to be coping with his mother’s death, but internally he still sees her and talks to her. Comforting at first, her constant presence becomes problematic when he meets Ohiana, a psychiatrist with whom he falls in love. What follows is an enchanting comic fantasy marked by outstanding performances and an honest and bittersweet depiction of the dynamics of relationships.",
