    "introduction": "In this short film, Simone Massi takes his inspiration from scenes of wars that really happened - from World War II to the refugee camps of the 6-Day War, from the attack on the Mostar bridge to the cars set on fire in the war in Syria - to tell what they all have in common.“The suffering of civilians is the only truth of any war, and Simone Massi shows it to us starkly. After so many images of the victims about their tragedy, Gino’s words open the horizon to a possible alternative: abolishing war is an urgent necessity. In this film, there is everything Gino has done and thought in his life against the logic of violence,” says Simonetta Gola, Communications Director of Emergency.",
