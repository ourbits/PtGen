    "introduction": "In their first feature-length adventure, Rosa and Dara set off with a group of friends and Grandma for a summer camp. When a piece of comet hits an old castle on an island near the camp, a labyrinth beneath the ruin opens up to reveal a gateway to another dimension, in which Laiko the dog gets lost. The rescue mission to an unknown world is complicated by the camp troublemaker, Bert, who meets himself in the other dimension. And the other Bert has a plan to change the world so that the first Bert will never get laughed at and have lots of friends. The comet goes out and the gate soon closes. Will Rosa and Dara be able to find the lost Laiko? And will Bert get the better of his evil self?",
