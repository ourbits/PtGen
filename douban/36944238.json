    "introduction": "In the remote village of Kbal Romeas, Cambodia, Neang, an indigenous mother, dreams of a life in harmony with nature. This dream was upended by a hydroelectric dam's construction, flooding their homes and displacing the community. Refusing compensation, Neang and some villagers chose to stay, considering themselves guardians of the land. They now live on the forest's edge, attempting to rebuild their village and maintain their ancestral ties. Despite being labeled outlaws by the government, their determination to rebuild on forbidden land showcases a profound connection to their heritage and the environment.",
