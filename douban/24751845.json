    "introduction": "Mary Ellen Bute was a director mostly known for her experimental animated works, but she also tried her hand at live-action in this short film from 1956. Based on a story by John Pudney, The Boy Who Saw Through tells the tale of a boy that can see through walls and observe the goings-on of the older individuals around him. The boy’s special power is used as a symbol for a child’s ability to see through to the true nature of adults. The film contains none of the wild experimental qualities found in Bute’s other work, but it is very successful as an affecting and charming short. It is also a bonus to see an early and earnest performance from a very young Christoper Walken in the lead role.（The Seventh Art）",
