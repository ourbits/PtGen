    "introduction": "From the production team that made the televised history of motor racing, The Power and The Glory, comes a new seven-part series on a year in the life of the McLaren Formula 1 racing team. Cameras followed McLaren, and team boss Ron Dennis , through the highs and lows of the 1993 Grand Prix season, a season in which number one driver Ayrton Senna began by complaining that his car was not competitive and ended with him signing to drive for arch-rivals Williams next year. It was a year, too, in which McLaren signed Michael Andretti , the American IndyCar champion, to drive as their number two - a gamble that didn't come off.",
