    "introduction": "Zazel: The Scent of Love is a highly regarded American hardcore pornographic film, photographed in October 1995 and released the following year. The film was produced by Cal Vista Studios—reportedly made at a cost of $237,000—and was directed by Dutch erotic photographer and filmmaker Philip Mond, who also did the camera work and designed the costumes and special make-up. It was Mond's second hardcore adult feature after Sex Off the Runway—and like his previous film, Zazel also featured a bevy of Penthouse Pets, including 1994 Pet of the Year Sasha Vinni, 1995 Pet of the Year Gina LaMarca, and 1999 Pet of the Year Nikie St. Gilles.",
