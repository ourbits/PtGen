    "introduction": "In the heart of a snow-covered Siberian forest, we meet an indigenous family preparing for the most important event of the year. Reindeer sleigh race. Two tiny log cabins, immersed in overwhelming white space. A man walking through the forest talks about how to train reindeer, but contrary to what he says, this time he fails to catch the animals intended for the race. We watch his return to the camp. From that moment on, the camera accompanies his family first, and then gradually more and more people, as the events leading to the climax. To the race. Dozens of reindeer herders meet there. We observe the course of the race itself and its final.Peaceful observation of the indigenous Siberian community hidden among the forests turns into a story about the clash of cultures, about geopolitical mechanisms that affect everyone, and about hope hidden in the relationships of people that are closest to each other and their instinct to follow the path of their ancestors.",
