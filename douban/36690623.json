    "introduction": "Set on a moving train on a rain-soaked night, a chance encounter between a 32-year-old everyman and an 8,000-year-old immortal – and a rat!– triggers a series of events that will intertwine their destinies. Amidst moral dilemmas and unexpected compassion, the ordinary man grapples with survival while the immortal – played with no small amount of relish by the charismatic Nivin Pauly – seeks to heal centuries-old wounds. Tamil filmmaker Ram’s fifth feature is a cinematic mediation on Tamil philosophy, whilst simultaneously offering an exploration of love, pain, suffering, compassion and redemption – what might surprise anyone familiar with Ram’s previous work is how markedly different, in tone, style and scale Seven Seas Seven Hills is.A filmmaker known for his gritty portrayals of contemporary life, often engaging with hard-hitting themes that critique modern society, Ram has shifted gear here, widening his canvas but also moving into a more fable-like style of storytelling, employing characters as ciphers in order to explore the human condition. Revelling in the genre expectations – both the fight and dance scenes are a sight to behold – this action conversation piece in motion becomes an irresistible mix of high melodrama, comedy, song and grand spectacle.",
