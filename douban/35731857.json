    "introduction": "Even in decay you’ll see beauty – you'll often find it really is there. Director Jodie Mack sets out for the third time in search of poetry in objects condemned to extinction, on this occasion in flowers and other plant life. In its visual eloquence this restful film draws our attention to details and textures and prompts us to contemplate the state of impermanence.",
