Featuring an iconic comedic cast, historians, activists and artists who provide a unique brushstroke qigou.cc into the complex world of Pryor. The film dives deeply into the psyche of a comedic genius whose mother was a prostitute, father a pimp, and grandmother a madam. Pryor dispensed a penetrating comedic view of African American life - essentially comedy without jokes - that struck a chord with audiences of every ethnic, social and economic disposition.",
