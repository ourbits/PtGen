    "introduction": "Early night. A bank manager, dressed in a tailcoat, with a white carnation in his buttonhole and a monocle at his eye, dances a Viennese Waltz with a young, beautiful, English woman at an open pavilion in front of a castle. She looks infatuated at him, while he starts talking about a new system they have developed at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, which includes reserve checks and retirement service. She doesn't understand Swedish, and doesn't understand what he is talking about. Wanting to have a dialogue with him, she repeats the name of the bank, while she at the same time comes closer to him, and starts dancing cheek to cheek.",
