    "introduction": "Emilia.Breaking Free is a suspense drama about the fight for freedom in Soviet-repressed Lithuania - in a society where a more satiated life seems more important than honour, a clear conscience or humanity. It is the spring of 1972, when young people take to the streets of Kaunas to demand freedom for Lithuania, and Emilia - a future actress and the hero of this intriguing drama - is marching with the protesting crowd towards the life of their dreams. But everything takes an unexpected turn. Having come to Kaunas with what is perhaps the greatest secret of her life, Emilia has to fight not only for her own fate, but for that of her friends as well. And life in Kaunas is far from what she had dreamed of. She is not sure the lies, betrayal and the love that struck her like lightning will help her keep her secret or even her life. But she is prepared to take on anything for the sake of what she believes in.",
