    "introduction": "Lilian Huckle was admitted to a mental hospital at the end of the 1920's. But was she really insane? Or was she just an original, a very different and slightly anarchistic woman? Sixty years have passed and the hospital is to close down so Lily's nephew arrives to collect her. But how will she and his wife Harriet get along...?Comment:She's Been Away is the story of a meeting. It's about two people who really reach each other and simulaneously deepen within themselves. The meeting doesn't happen with well meaning glances and intimate words. Instead it happens through battle, distrust and psychological shows of strength.This is a film which fights for the right to be an individual - even an eccentric individual. It takes place in an english upper-class mileu where a certain amount of madness is tolerated, even seen as a sign of aristocracy, as long as it doesn't have to be taken seriously, is meaningless, false, and doesn't inspire change.Even if the revolt in She's Been Away is expressed by smashing the husbands nice, well-kept Daimler, director Peter Hall and script-writer Stephen Poliakoff succeed in getting their message across.Keep getting angry. Keep fighting.",
