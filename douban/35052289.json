    "introduction": "This documentary looks at the stories of what playing the so-called 'grindhouse' circuit during the glory days of inner-city cinemas in the 1970s and 1980s. Speaking to some of the underrated giants in the field of grime and slime, the documentary was conceived for the very brief UK Blu-Ray of \"Just Before Dawn\", the classic Jeff Lieberman movie. However, when that disc came out with only a six month license on the rights, the producers opted to revisit the documentary, extend its running time and add \"Kill Squad\" director Patrick G. Donahue and his actor Jean Glaudé to the running time. The finished production can now be seen on Turbine Germany's release of \"Kill Squad\".",
