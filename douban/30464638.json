    "introduction": "Old GI Joe cartoon PSA's are reconfigured with new, naughty dialogue. Oh my!This is just dumb. Voice over comedy never works – NEVER. Not even the talented Woody Allen could pull it off with What's Up, Tiger Lily. Instead, we see through the ruse and focus solely on the level of wit. The cretinness amount of cleverness on display should indicate how seriously you should take this satire.",
