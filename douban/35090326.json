Without saying a word to Anaïs, Isabelle calls Léa, Anaïs' mother, who lives in Montreal. Léa immediately flies to Switzerland. She wants to understand why her daughter has converted to Islam. But Isabelle believes that if Anaïs secretly became a Muslim, there must be a reason. A reason Isabelle and Léa need to discover. As Isabelle and Léa realize how fanatic Anaïs has grown, Léa also finds out that Isabelle, her mother, was involved in a terrible attack on a Swissair flight, in 1970, which killed 47 people flying from Zurich to Tel Aviv. Among the victims, was Léa's own father. What if both stories were connected?",
