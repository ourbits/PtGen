    "introduction": "This short video was shot in the urgency of the Israeli war against Lebanon in July 2006. It sheds light on how the Lebanese would go about their daily lives during and right after the war. Far from the bombastic frenzy of media broadcasts, the tragedy of war is recorded with compassion, simplicity, and even humor.",
