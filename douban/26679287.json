    "introduction": "This film proves the old adage \"You can pick your friends and you can pick your nose, but you shouldn't pick friends who rob banks.\" Local bad girl Hilda convinces Connie to join her at a party and lends Connie a dress she \"borrowed\" from the cleaners where they both work. When the dress gets torn, the owner Jane and her boyfriend Neil notice and Connie gets blamed, fired, and prosecuted for it. Neil is the prosectuing attorney, but feels sorry for Connie, so he drops the charges and loans her the money to pay off the dress. Connie goes to the big city to escape the shame and get a job to pay off Neil. She meets Hilda there and gets mistakenly arrested, along with Hilda and Tony, for bank robbery. A kindly parole officer believes her story and helps get her paroled. Connie returns home, gets engaged to Neal and is doing well when Hilda returns once more and threatens to ruin her life by spilling Connie's secret shame.",
