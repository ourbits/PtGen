    "introduction": "Symphony in Blood Red is an Italian 'giallo', a horror film inspired by the work of Dario Argento. It is the first feature movie directed by Luigi Pastore, and in collaboration with Antonio Tentori (Cat In The Brain), who co-wrote the screenplay.During a psychoanalytic session, a psychologist suggests her patient to go into a specialized clinic, but her suggestion unleashes the mysterious fellow's latent madness. Abandon is the key factor to understanding his delirium, which will drive him to take up killing once more. So, after getting rid of psychologist's body, he decides to carry on the \"therapy\" by himself, with the help of a small camera, recording his feelings in a crazy crescendo. \"Chrysalis\" is the metaphor the hero uses to describe his own transformation, the last metamorphosis in his life, which will change him into a ruthless and sadistic serial killer.",
