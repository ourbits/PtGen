    "introduction": "A psychotherapist (Charlotte Rampling) listens to archived testimonies recorded during her sessions with former patients. Ailyn, Bruno, and Gilles describe their psychosis. Their words and stories mingle with images of a journey across the icy Arctic aboard a large sailboat, where intimate accounts of mental torment are transformed into metaphors showing the decay of the climate. Among these narratives, the therapist also recounts her own journey through psychosis.",
