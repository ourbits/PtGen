    "introduction": "Married to policeman Steve with two little boys Jo is bored with her existence as a housewife and, when she accidentally shop-lifts, gets a buzz - so much so that she carries on doing it, until she is eventually caught. She spends a day at the police station before she is fined and released without a criminal record but lies to Steve that her failure to collect the children from school was because she fainted and was taken to hospital. Next day he discovers the truth but at least the situation allows her to air her dissatisfaction with her marriage and herald change for the better.",
