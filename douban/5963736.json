    "introduction": "\"Dat Kho; Land of Sorrows\" is a film depicting the story of one South Vietnamese family during the Vietnam War. Although the story is fiction, it is drawn from real life experiences. The writer weaves many timeless and poignant issues that are raised during the war. The film is directed by Ha Thuc Can, a former CBS cameraman that covered the war. This was his one and only venture in directing film. The film was shot on location in Vietnam and actually contains real footage of the evacuation of Hue during the Tet Offensive. The film stars Trinh Cong Son, a Vietnamese musician and antiwar protester. His songs are incorporated into the story line and help bring great emotional depth to the film. Several issues are addressed in the film, mainly the circumstances and hardships of Trinh Quan's (Trinh Cong Son) family; the issue of Buddhist immolation, the Tet Offensive and it also weaves a romantic subplot. The romance revolves around Thuy, Quan's sister, and Nghia, who is firm in his political neutrality. By creatively manipulating all of these issues, Ha Thuc Can delivers a wonderful depiction of what it was like to be a South Vietnamese during the Vietnam War.",
