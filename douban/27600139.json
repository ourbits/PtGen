    "introduction": "Inspired by Brexit and Donald Trump, Last Village on the Right is a delightfully tongue-in-cheek comedy-horror, following a group of American film makers on the way to the Cannes film market to sell a horror film, when they get lost and find themselves in a stunning small mountain town in the South of France, where a strange couple, Adolphi and his wife Kiki, seduce and murder tourists. Last Village on the Right will be a universally enjoyable, terrifyingly hilarious romp through the Pyrenees, which will have audiences rolling in the aisles.",
