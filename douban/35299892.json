    "introduction": "Weslei lives in a shantytown on the edge of a paradisiacal dune desert in northern Brazil. For everyone, he’s a little boy. But Weslei dreams of a completely different body. In his inner world, this body, difficult to assume, takes on a dreamlike form and becomes the body of a mermaid. He wants to fight this “nature” that has imposed a gender on him, and wants to project his dreams into a crude and brutal reality. This reality is the one epitomized by his father, and more generally by Brazilian society, sexist and religious, where the question of gender is absolutely taboo.",
