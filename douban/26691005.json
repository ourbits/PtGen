Rehabilitation and assistance of his partner Asia help him regain mobility and improve his functions.

What keeps Janusz going and motivates to carry on is his big dream - he would like to dive again, despite major hazard for his health and life. His goal is to travel to beautiful but perilous Blue Hole in Dahab, Egypt which poses a challenge even to fit divers. Written by HBO",
