    "introduction": "In The Trouble with Atheism, Liddle argued that atheists can be as dogmatic and intolerant as the adherents of religion. Liddle said, \"History has shown us that it's not religion that's the problem, but any system of thought that insists that one group of people are inviolably in the right, whereas the others are in the wrong and must somehow be punished.\" Liddle argues, for example, that eugenic policies are the logical consequence of dogmatic adherence to Darwinism. - Wikipedia",
