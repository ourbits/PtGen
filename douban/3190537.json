    "introduction": "Film Info200680 minsColorUSAIn EnglishDVDSynopsisAs one of the world’s preeminent photographers, Sally Mann creates artwork that challenges viewers’ values and moral attitudes. Described by Time magazine as “America's greatest photographer,” she first came to international prominence in 1992 with “Immediate Family,” a series of complex and enigmatic pictures of her own children. This work, and the controversy that followed it, was chronicled in Steven Cantor’s award-winning short film, Blood Ties.WHAT REMAINS returns to follow the creation of Mann’s new seminal work: a photo series revolving around various aspects of death and decay. Never one to compromise, Sally Mann reflects on her own personal feelings toward death as she continues to examine the boundaries of contemporary photography. Shown at home on her family farm in Virginia, she is surrounded by her husband and now-grown children, and her willingness to reveal her artistic process as it unfolds allows the viewer to gain exclusive entrance to her world.Spanning five years, WHAT REMAINS contains unbridled access to the many stages of Mann’s work, and is a rare glimpse of an eloquent and brilliant artist.WHAT REMAINS will be released on DVD on April 22, 2008 and it is available now for educational and institutional rentals and screenings.",
