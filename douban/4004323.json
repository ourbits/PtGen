    "introduction": "Geoff Brewster, a middle-aged man who has retreated to the family's isolated, coastal shack to die in peace, is also going blind. He spends his days walking on the beach and leaving tape-recorded confessions to his estranged wife, Sally. But Geoff's solitude is interrupted when his Porsche-driving nephew, Josh, turns up and decides to stay. Josh's strange behaviour sets Geoff on edge, and when Sally arrives for her weekly cleaning, the shack is ready to explode. The arrival of two strangers bearing the ashes of one of Geoff's lovers sets Geoff and Josh on a collision course that threatens to destroy both of them.",
