    "introduction": "The story revolves around Alice Bassi, who’s a little over thirty and single despite her best efforts. Alice works as a production assistant for a small TV network with very hope for career development, despite often being the most competent person in the room. As if that wasn’t enough, her ex-boyfriend Carlo is about to get married and become a father, and, to top it all off, a charming and mysterious new creative director called Davide has been hired to monitor the productivity of her team. But Alice’s life is about to change thanks to an encounter with Tio, an actor in the network’s breakthrough soap opera and a self-styled astrology guru who is destined to soon become her own personal Astrological Guide for Broken Hearts.",
