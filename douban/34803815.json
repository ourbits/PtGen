Police Detective Tom Lynn takes charge of the investigation and orders shakedown of youth gangs in the city's toughest section, but this fails to locate members of the Wolf-Pack gang. A savage beating is given an innocent witness by Bennett, who takes matters in his own hands in the belief that the law authorities are too slow.",
