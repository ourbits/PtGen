She wants to be free.Nora (40) roams through a museum in Vienna, has sex with a young man and hitchhikes randomly on to Bratislava. She hides her identity by telling little lies. She changes her look, finds work as a chambermaid and makes friends with a young Slovakian stripper, Etela, and her husband Tamás, a cook.Meanwhile in Berlin, Philip (mid 40s) is trying to manage his family, his job and his affair with Monika. Against his own convictions he has to defend a racist teenager in court, who has beaten an African man into a coma. He struggles with his role as a single parent and cannot really commit himself to Monika as his everyday life has lost meaning since Nora disappeared. The only person Philip really opens up to is the unconscious coma patient.Nora’s desire for freedom is Philip’s chain.",
