    "introduction": "DJs have a gift of listening to the best of their communities and then presenting that back to them. When live local voices are told to shut up and play the play-list, it ends an age-old symbiotic relationship between radio and the community. This hurts emerging bands, small charities and even the emergence of new ideas on a local level. Corporate FM uncovers the high finance shell-game that stole local control of radio from communities across America. The film also reveals how radio may become local again.",
