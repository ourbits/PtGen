Nathan is also the owner of a workshop which employs seamstresses who live with mental illness, run by Faigie’s mother, Rayzee.Following a failed suicide attempt, Faigie becomes part of Nathan’s household, helping to run the home while Nathan’s wife, Yocheved, is pregnant with their first child, after nearly two decades of marriage. The bond between the two families tightens as Faigie grows dangerously close to Nathan, though Faigie’s feelings and her longing for a relationship with Nathan can never materialize as they are governed by the rules dictated by their religious beliefs- which could not allow such passion to be consummated.",
