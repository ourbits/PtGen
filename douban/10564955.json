    "introduction": "Ozan is a ten-year old boy living in a small coastal town on the Aegean. His friends make fun of him, calling him an “infidel” because his grandfather Mehmet is an immigrant from Crete. Ozan is afraid of being left alone. He gets angry at his family, especially his grandfather, and he stubbornly challenges his family saying “We are Turks”.Mehmet Bey, Ozan’s grandfather, is a respected shopkeeper in the community. He takes the people of the town under his wings, and helps them with their problems. Mehmet Bey is known for his tolerance and his grandson’s attitude not only has him worried but grieves him as well.Mehmet Bey and his family were torn from their land and forced to migrate from Crete during the population exchange when he was just seven years old. Mehmet Bey’s greatest desire is to see the land of his birth before he dies. It is this longing that makes him frequently drop bottles containing letters into the turquoise waters of the Aegean.DEDEMİN İNSANLARI describes the spectacular transformation of a family and their country through the eyes of a ten-year old child and his grandfather living in a small town.As you watch this story about the people in the crowded and warm Aegean, you will once again experience the population exchange, what it means to be the “other”, the ability to belong anywhere no matter where you go, insurrections, numerous minorities, and both sides of the Aegean, but this time from a fresh perspective.The shooting of the film took place in Crete, Gökçeada, Milas, Bodrum and Söke.",
