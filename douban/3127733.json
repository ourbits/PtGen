    "introduction": "A champion high school rugby player (Russell Page) has a secret desire to be a ballet dancer, having spent 11 years in ballet school. Seizing an opportunity to audition for a local company's presentation of \"Romeo and Juliet\", he nonetheless fears what will happen to his reputation if the other kids in his school find out. Adding the practices to his already burgeoning schedule quickly starts to create problems with his friends (Radha Mitchell, Martin Henderson), his teachers, his coach, his play director (Paul Mercurio), and his ballet partner (Rebecca Yates). Of course, it all comes together on the stage of the Sydney Opera House. Written by John Sacksteder {jsackste@bellsouth.net} @imdb",
