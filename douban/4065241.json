    "introduction": "Striking brunette, Lorraine Schultz (Melodie Sisk)) lives in suburban Nowheresville and is almost catatonically bored with her job as a nurse. In fact, she’s bored with just about everything, including her boyfriend Ben (Matthew Hartman). So bored, she hardly bats an eyelid when she catches him in bed with another woman. She does, however, manage to kick him out and replace his rent checks with those of Adrian (Maggie Ross) an über bubbly short young woman who suffers from the delusion she can make it as a model.After leafing through an S&M magazine she finds on the bus, Lorraine decides to moonlight as a dominatrix but before long she finds even forcing masked johns to clean toilets can be boring. Adrian, meanwhile, believes she’s on the first rung of the ladder to achieving her dream when she’s hired by a bedding store as a ‘model’. In truth, her job involves enticing male customers to lie down on mattresses with her and allow them to feel her up – all in an effort to boost sales.There is a shift in tone however, when Adrian’s boyfriend Mitch (Carlos Bustamente) develops an obsession with Lorraine and begins stalking her.Director Zach Clark utilises saturated colours, retro costume design and a deliberately slow pace to give his edgy second feature its' very unique and distinctive look.",
