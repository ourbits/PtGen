    "introduction": "In a city where skaters and society fight over public spaces, 16-year-old Sketchy suddenly is the hero: he has found an empty warehouse. “Skatopia” becomes the coolest skate spot in town. For Sketchy and his crew, a dream comes true. Skatopia feels like the only place where they can be themselves and they are ready to pick up the fight against anyone who wants to steal it from them: big companies, police, annoyed neighbours and other skate crews.But Sketchy has not told his friends that the fight is personal for him and that he initially claimed the warehouse to challenge his demanding father whose company is about to buy it. Sketchy does everything to protect Skatopia, but by doing so, he slowly turns into the person he hates most: his manipulative dad.Soon Skatopia starts triggering the worst in each character and, things get out of hand. Dixie’s homosexuality is unveiled, Puk ends up in jail, Elena deliberately injures herself and Brush lands in a coma. Will skating overcome the hating?",
