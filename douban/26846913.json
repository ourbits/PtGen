    "introduction": "Director Francesco Carrozzini creates an intimate portrait of his mother, Franca Sozzani, the legendary editor-in-chief of Italian Vogue. From the ridiculous to the sublime, her astonishing but often controversial magazine covers have not only broken the rules but have set the high bar for fashion, art and commerce over the past 25 years. From the legendary \"Black Issue\" and the \"Plastic Surgery issue\" Sozzani remains deeply committed to exploring subject matter off limits to most in order to shake up the status quo and occasionally redefine the concept of beauty. With interviews from Karl Lagerfeld, Bruce Weber, Baz Luhrmann, Courtney Love and many others, Carrozzini gives us a behind the scenes glimpse into his mother's creative process as well as peek into her vulnerabilities both past and present. Deeply insightful and often emotional this film is like a love letter from a son to his mother.",
