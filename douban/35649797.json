    "introduction": "Borrowing Bukowski’s interpretations, the boundlessly inventive director, poet, pianist Khavn conducts unquestionably odd, bizarrely fascinating spectacle, shot on 10 various cameras (including Super8).The visionary reimagined & reinvented “Orphea”, selected for Encounters of the Berlinale 2020, is not a sequel by Khavn. This is a not so romantic encounter with the wicked evil twin sister of Orphea, who is also named Orphea.They say Manila is a gateway to Hell with three entrances: for lust, anger and greed. A vibrant city dazzles with hunger, drugs, violence, poverty on almost every corner. Even after burial Orphea wants to embrace her beloved Eurydike, deceased from food poisoning on January 22nd. She passionately descends into the apocalyptic underworld in a quest of nine extraordinary songs, but maybe the wandering Eurydike no longer needs any love?Edvinas Pukšta",
