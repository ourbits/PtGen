    "introduction": "This is a movie about amateur spirit made with an amateur spirit. It is the story of two adolescents who live in a small village, work in temporary summer jobs in a small town near their village, and have a passion for cinema. One of the boys works in a barber shop, the other sells watermelons. Whenever they find time, they work on their old little machine to show motion pictures from disposed films they collect from the local movie-theater, the only person in support of these efforts being the village idiot. While their efforts continue hopelessly but ambitiously, one of finds himself in love. The movie was inspired by the director's own passion about cinema, and was made in his own village, all the acting being done by local villagers. Written by Anonymous",
