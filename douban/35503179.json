    "introduction": "An author who defies classification, Doris Lessing has plowed both wide and deep, combining acute observation of everyday life with a concern for broad issues such as how society should be organized, the value of politics, the role of women, and the nature of individuality. In this vintage program, biographer and critic Claire Tomalin and science fiction author Brian Aldiss talk with Lessing about her life and her work, with a special focus on her chilling novel The Fifth Child. Dramatized extracts from that novel and from Memoirs of a Survivor, The Good Terrorist, and The Sentimental Agents, read by actresses Janet Suzman and Susan Fleetwood, are included. (54 minutes)",
