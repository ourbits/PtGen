    "introduction": "This is a never released piece of video art created by Aryan Kaganof when he still went by his birth name 'Ian Kerkhof' based on an installation he created in 'tribute' to Dutch actress Sylvia Kristel. Part doc and part video art, there is certainly a sort of tragic and forlorn tone to film that seems to sum up Kaganof's thoughts on Kristel's life and career.",
