    "introduction": "Andrzej Barański's film, long fascinated with provincial climates, is based on humorous texts by Stanisław Czycz. Impersonating the fictional character of an amateur photographer Michał C., the writer analyses his photographic output. Michał C., a photography enthusiast, invisible for the audience, comments on the demonstrated photographs from behind the frame. They are to illustrate and document the thesis put forward in the title, that photography is a difficult art.",
