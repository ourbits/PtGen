    "introduction": "In his audio-visual diary, award-winning filmmaker Peter Mettler looks at the miracles contained in everyday things and occurrences. His meditative approach and sensitive camera searches, remembers, and creates a generous space to expose the fragility and profound nature of relationships, where reflections about the human condition and our environment follow one another in a stream of consciousness. At times tragic or comedic, philosophical or poetic, the diary is laced with psychedelic and experimental imagery and sound that enhance its trance-like feel. Combining personal conversations, reflection, family history, memoir, homage, and love, Mettler takes the documentary form somewhere it hasn't been before. A work of maturity and the director's most intimate film to date that interrogates our universal human destiny with grace and generosity.",
