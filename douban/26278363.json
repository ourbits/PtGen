    "introduction": "A genre-defying comedy about the unreliability of memory. It deconstructs its own narrative as it crisscrosses between fiction, documentary and dreams. The film is a series of interlinking puzzles - an unsolved Hollywood murder; the search for the origins of a legendary joke; and the mystery of why the filmmaker's own family left him for dead. Historical figure Ayn Rand, movie actor Cesar Romero, and television journalist Mike Wallace turn up as additional pieces of the puzzle.",
