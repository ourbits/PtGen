    "introduction": "This amazing vampire movie was entirely shot in one night back in 1983 by Jomard Muniz de Brito . I did directing assistance and last year I helped to restore it by a welcoming fund provided by Janela Internacional de Cinema do Recife. This is 35 minutes of almost frenetic pace and this may be the feature film Jomard might have wanted to shoot on Super 8 . Neither a short nor a feature film, we should take this as collective creation. A film that fluctuates between theatre and cinema, insides and outsides, images communicating with the voice and musicality of tropicalisms. Collages, quotes, DIY movie making, stolen memories from in between that which is popular-national and international jump-and-catch pop music. Let us be, thus, co-authors and spectators living in the present continuum - writ living, cineliving - of our vampiristic wanderings, dissipations,paradoxes and polymorphisms.",
