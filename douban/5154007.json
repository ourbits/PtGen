    "introduction": "'GHOSTED' tells a story of survival inside a British Prison. Jack a model prisoner, has kept his head down and done his time. After his wife confirms that she is leaving him, on the anniversary of their son's death, the only thing that keeps him from going under is the new prisoner, Paul. Jack's cell mate Ahmed, attempts to guide him on a path of salvation, a path that involves saving Paul from the clutches of the wing beast, Clay. Jack struggles between the curiosity of the head prison officer Donner, and the violent determination of clay, eventually saving Paul. As Jack and Paul finally accept each other, it soon becomes clear that Paul is not all he seems and may have a closer connection to Jack than he could ever imagine.",
