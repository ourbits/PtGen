    "introduction": "This film unveils the enigmatic story of Francisco Salamone, an architect-ingeneer who built more than 70 astonishing buildings (mostly town halls, cemeteries and slaughterhouses) between 1936 and 1940 at the Buenos Aires province during the administration of a pro-fascist governor. Academics, artists and common people we can call \"salamonics\" tell us the facts and theories they could get from the silence around these enigmatic art-deco towers. The testimony of Francisco's daughters, an exquisite music and a passionate research keep us hooked to this architectural quest.",
