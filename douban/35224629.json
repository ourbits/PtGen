    "introduction": "“Art describes the eternal”, Roy Andersson muses on the set of About Endlessness (44th HKIFF), his apparent final feature summoning poetry from life’s most mundane nooks to reveal profound truths about human existence. In an affectionate and often enchanting tribute, director Fred Scott immerses himself in the Swedish master’s vision of cinema, examining his use of trompe l’oeil trickery in his personal studio to create all his unmistakable tragicomic tableau scenes. An honest portrait of an artist with instinctive sensitivity and empathy, and simultaneously, of a man struggling with alcoholism and the emotional toll his creativity has taken.",
