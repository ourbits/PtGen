    "introduction": "As a baby, Millie was washed up onto the beach of a fishing village and taken in by Hy Jessop. Jessop has abused her all her life, forcing her to work as a drudge and beating her often. Her only protector is Sem, a half-witted hunchback. After being beaten one too many times, Millie runs away and hides in a mansion that's supposed to be haunted. The next day, author Ronald Roberts arrives in search of some peace and quiet so he can complete his novel. He moves into the mansion and Millie plays ghost until he discovers her. The two of them fall in love, but Roberts is already engaged to Beatrice, who shows up in the village with a group of his friends. Dejected, Millie returns to what passed for a home, and she finds it even worse than before.",
