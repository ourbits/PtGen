Its topic, raised for the first time in feature films, opens one of the most shameful and terrifying pages in the history of the USSR: the so-called \"punitive psychiatry\" used by the KGB in the fight against political and religious dissidents. The film's protagonist is a young man who wants to feel free in his country – free to listen to rock music or wear long hair. However, his longing for freedom comes up against the cruelty of the system in a country where the KGB uses the most shameful methods to control people like him. Ukrainian director Denys Tarasov’s debut film.",
