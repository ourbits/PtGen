    "introduction": "n a 2-minute introduction to this piece, Leonard Maltin briefly discusses Disney animator Ward Kimball's impact on the series, for which he was director and producer. He also explains the reception to this episode. He reveals it was later edited into a featurette, accompanying Davy Crockett and the River Pirates and meriting an Academy Award nomination for Best Documentary Short. As the title implies, this episode looks into the potential of people traveling to space.This new series is launched with a brief, and often light-hearted history of experiments with rockets. The possibilites of satellites are considered. And then a practical look at what a spaceman shall have to physically and psychologically face: momentum, weightlessness, radiation, and perhaps space sickness. These animated sequences on the spaceman are most inspired, providing a factually accurate and visually amusing fashion. The episode concludes with a simulation of a launch into space.",
