    "introduction": "«Reisender Krieger» was a very famous art-house-kind-of-road-movie in its time: Krieger (Willy Ziegler) is a make-up seller who travels mostly through Switzerland and meets very different people. Through its sophisticated but very simple and often funny dialogues, its very sensitively recorded characters and its cinéma verité style it suggests the zeitgeist and still confronts us in a very humorous way with the very existential and highly political questions.",
