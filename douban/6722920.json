    "introduction": "An aged boxer Đuka, left without any source of income, accompanied by a troupe of declining artists (ballet dancers),is roaming the suburbia streets, deceiving, cheating and occasionally murdering people. They hardly make ends meet, and the idea is underlined by grotesque acting performances that occasionally affect birds from the title. In spite of ensuing social problems, wretched suburbs from the movie symbolically represent the outskirts of human mind, where the moral values don't exist anymore.Despite the emphasized pesimism, ''Crows'' were very well accepted by domestic and foreign critics, and was screened at 11 world movie festivals, even at the accompanying program of the Cannes. But after domestic festival in Pula (Croatia), they were never screened again in its country of origin.",
