    "introduction": "When 24-year-old Ash moves back home and asks their mom, Julie, to teach them to drive, Julie jumps at the opportunity to spend some quality time with her child. As their first lesson begins, Julie marvels at the similarities between the two of them. But anxious Ash struggles to grasp even the most basic of car operations, and soon Julie grows just as frustrated as her grown-up kid. The truth of why Ash never learned to drive comes out, as well as years of unspoken resentments, misunderstandings, and secret hopes. Will Julie and Ash make it down the driveway, and through their complicated history, in one piece? Or perhaps this was the break they needed to finally turn down a new road.",
