    "introduction": "Black and White Short AnimationThis film is incredible. The most captivating piece of animation I have seen. It takes film noir approach and tells the story of an animator who gets the tables turned upon him. An animator has died and the puppets he has spent his whole life animating, then proceed to animate him instead. It is a very personal experience as they treat him with the same tenderness as an animator would treat his puppets with. This has very many levels and will certainly keep you thinking about it for a long time after you have watched it. there are many references to other sources and some peculiar choices like blank eyes for example. there is a deep message going on in this, and it is up to you to find your own meaning from it. it is a true work of art. It is filmed in black and white, and has a brilliant score. it starts off very upbeat and then towards the end gets melancholy. This is a must see, an incredible film!",
