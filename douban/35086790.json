    "introduction": "Shot entirely on location in California maximum security prisons, Step to the Line is a virtual reality documentary that aims to provoke a transformation in the spectator's eyes about prisoners, the prison system and even themselves. In this project, we see how release from incarceration can be just as jarring as intake and how parallel lives diverge when someone serves time. Produced by Oculus, in association with Defy Ventures, Step to The Line, premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival.",
