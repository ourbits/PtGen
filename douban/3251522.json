    "introduction": "After fighting as an Israeli soldier in the 1973 war, and troubled by the nation's obsessive mixing of the Bible with politics, filmmaker Ilan Ziv left for America, which he considered a \"safe haven\" because of its separation between church and state. Thirty-five years later, alarmed by the prominent role of religion in the 2008 American presidential campaign, he decides to make a road trip to understand the phenomenon.The 4000 miles journey that began in the snows of Iowa with the promise of a new dawn of American politics ends with the rumbling of decades old cultural ; JESUS POLITICS is a probing look at how deeply religious faith shapes 21st century American politics.",
