    "introduction": "The story of a man going through an identity crisis, finding a new home in a mystically beautiful, feral landscape. The story, too, of a man who must break the curse set by his mother out of love for his father. Thirty years have passed when Črt returns to his birth village, Trigrad, upon his father's death, to sell the old family farm. Behind the idyllic facade, on a sunny day resembling a sugary postcard, many layers of a mysterious, surreal, at times terrifying world are hidden. What starts as a one-day business deal turns into an exploration of Črt's ancestral history and the grim events that reshaped this place.",
