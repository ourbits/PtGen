    "introduction": "After breaking with Zukor and Lasky, Hart signed a two-picture deal with United Artists, releasing his final feature, Tumbleweeds, in 1925. An elegiac farewell to “the last of the west,” Tumbleweeds was well received by critics and audiences but so badly distributed that Hart took UA to court, ultimately winning a $278,000 damage judgment ($5 million in today’s money). The second film was never made. While that case was still under appeal Hart reissued Tumbleweeds with a recorded score and spoken prologue.",
