    "introduction": "The Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011 turned the surrounding towns into a desolate land, making the area into a \"radioactive forest\". Without human presence, the land is roamed by wildlife like civets, macaques and wild boars. A project is underway to study the deserted areas by attaching a camera to wild boars to record the conditions of the former farmlands. 5 years after the disaster, we take a close look at how radiation has affected the wildlife, and what it entails for us humans.",
