    "introduction": "The High Frontier: The Untold Story of Gerard K. O’Neill uncovers the legacy of Princeton physicist and space visionary, Dr. Gerard K. O’Neill, who wrote the 1977 book, The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space. The book and O’Neill’s subsequent activism sparked a grassroots movement to build Earth-like habitats in space in order to solve Earth’s greatest crises; a vision that is still alive today. Through old stories of “Gerry” as many called him, and the social impact he made on the world, this documentary pays tribute to the unsung hero of today’s space race, while hoping to inspire all ages and walks of life to reignite our planet’s space venturing spirit.",
