    "introduction": "Angry Birds Mystery Island introduces three new Hatchling characters—”Mia,” “Rosie,” and “Buddy”—and a foreign-exchange piglet named “Hamylton.” These rambunctious tweens receive an all-expenses-paid (and completely un-asked-for) island getaway, when they are mistakenly catapulted onto an uncharted island. Left to explore the exotic sights, smells, and unexplained phenomena of their new environment without any adults around, the ragtag bunch quickly learns that, in order to survive and make it back home, they will need to unlock the mysteries of the island together.",
