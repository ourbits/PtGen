    "introduction": "Magic in the Sky investigates the impact of television on the Inuit people of the Canadian Arctic. The film also documents the establishment of the first Inuit-language television network, called Inukshuk, which began broadcasting to six Inuit communities in December, 1980, utilizing the Anik B communications satellite. The Inuit's efforts to create an indigenous television network mirrors the struggle of any culture trying to preserve its unique identity.",
