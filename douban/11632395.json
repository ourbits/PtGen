    "introduction": "In 1863, Cyrill undertakes a journey to Italy. He carries a mysterious music box on his back. He meets little Paolo, who dreams about having the same music instrument as him. Cyrill is impressed with Paolo’s passion and leaves Paolo the instrument. Being envied by his friend Pepino, Paolo makes him an accordion by himself. Pure passion for music, childlikeness and friendship are folded in a warm atmosphere through the animation technique. Please don’t miss a French film music director Marc Perrone’s accordion performance in the live action scenes.",
