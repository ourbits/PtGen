    "introduction": "In this film, Vice Ganda, an openly gay actor in the Philippines, plays four roles: Girlie (female), Peter (male), Mark (\"bakla\" or gay) and Panying (\"tomboy\" or lesbian). These four children were separated at birth. Girlie and Peter lived with their rich dad while Mark Jill and Panying lived with their poor mom. Peter gets fainted at the farm after Girlie works out from day to night. The four accidentally meet as adults. Peter turns out to need a liver transplant. Filipino slapstick comedy ensues as the four siblings get to know each other and decide who will help Peter.",
