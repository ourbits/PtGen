    "introduction": "Socrates is a nonconformist philosopher and idealistic seeker of the truth in Ancient Athens. He acts as teacher to his dedicated students without pay over the objections of Xantippe, his henpecking wife, and is viewed by the establishment as a corrupter of the city's youth. Hypocritical Athenian leaders conspire to indict him on charges of heresy and treason, both capital offenses. However, his trial is suspended when the decades-long Peloponnesian War ends, and Sparta occupies Athens, effectively ending democratic rule. Anxious to meet the renowned philosopher, Spartan King Pausanias takes an immediate liking to him. Socrates idealistically turns down the King's offers of booty and escape from the city and convinces him to restore Athenian democracy even though that means he will be recharged for his \"crimes.\" The aging orator believes he can convince his judge and jury that his quest for the truth is consistent with the best Athenian values.
