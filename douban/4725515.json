    "introduction": "Year 1208. The first Eastward enlargement of Europe is under way. Brutal forces of the Teutonic Order are steadily marching on. In their path live a simple and peaceful people, whose main pastimes include cultivating the earth, singing and, if possible, doing both at the same time. They are the Estonians. Ignorant in the ways of war, they find an unlikely leader in a young boy with Catholic upbringing. In their fight for freedom, the Estonians encounter numerous obstacles, including the Germans, French, Russians and, worst of all, the Latvians. Will they succeed in defeating their enemies or will they experience a cultural awakening?Estonian history gets a topsy-turvy interpretation in this satiric comedy from director Kaaren Kaer. Uru (Ott Sepp) is an adventurous young man who has been getting in touch with his compassionate side while studying at a monastery. When he comes back home to Estonia, he finds things are not as he might have hoped; both France and Germany are trying to lay claim to his homeland, and the nation is preparing itself for a long battle to win its independence. Despite his non-violent philosophy, Uru is drawn into the war to free his people, though it soon becomes evident neither strategy or combat skills are his strong suit. Malev (aka Men At Arms) was written by members of O-Fraktsioon, a noted Estonian sketch-comedy troupe.",
