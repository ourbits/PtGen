    "introduction": "\"La Prueba\"( The Trial) a film by Judith Vélez represent a new wave of peruvian movie directors. The Trial is about a young woman's journey to the peruvian highland(Arequipa), Miranda must find her long time-fugitive father due to her terminally ill brother who desesperately needs a blood transfusion from him.In the road she encounters with Saúl(Days of Santiago's Pietro Sibille) an hidraulic engineer who helps her to find her father. \"La Prueba\" is the first feature film from Judith Vélez. Despite some flaws like the drama-less script and some over-used sketches(like the vision of andean villagers), Vélez presents us a correct film with images which generate interest and a script which shows us powerful and accurate dialogues(like those between Miranda and her father). This film successfully explores a conflictive father-daughter relationship and counts with a very good cinematography from Ricardo Rodríguez. The performances are actually very good, including Jimena Lindo's performance as Miranda. The powerful script and a clean work from Judith Vélez brings hope for peruvian cinema.",
