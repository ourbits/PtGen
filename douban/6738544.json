    "introduction": "On a stormy night in July 1997, two sisters disappear without a trace...Simultaneously a murder-mystery and an exposé of endemic corruption in the Philippines today, Give Up Tomorrow looks intimately at the case of Paco Larrañaga, a student accused of murder on the provincial island of Cebu. The film exposes a Kafkaesque world populated by flamboyantly crooked public officials, cops on the take, and a frenzied legal and media circus. It's also an intimate drama focused on the near mythic struggle of two angry, sorrowful mothers who have dedicated more than a decade to executing or saving one young man.",
