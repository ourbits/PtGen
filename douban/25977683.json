Before the boxes can even be unpacked, the couple realizes that there are strange occurrences happening in the house that were not disclosed by the real estate agent. At first more curious than scared, Tim, Emily and Emily's childhood friend Claire, embark on finding out who or what is haunting their house. As clues to a dark history of not only the house, but to Emily's past begin to unfold, what began as a series unusual paranormal episodes, soon morphs into violent acts, and the couple find themselves at the mercy of a vengeful spirit.  故事开始，新婚夫妇艾米莉和蒂姆决定在艾米莉童年居住过的小农场定居。还没拆行李，夫妇俩就发现了房产代理商之前没有注意到的怪事。一开始，好奇心赛过恐惧，艾米莉，蒂姆，还有艾米莉的好友克莱尔开始寻找究竟是谁（或者是什么东西）徘徊在这幢房子里不肯离去。随着关于房子黑暗历史的揭开，艾米莉的过往也逐渐浮出水面。一系列灵异事件很快变得危险而暴力，夫妻俩很快发现他们只能受由愤怒的怨灵摆布。(来源于IMDb)",
