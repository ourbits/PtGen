    "introduction": "Onishi’s short Book Of Genesis (2002) shows us in an impressive way the connection between the sky and skylines, made of all that technical stuff human beings have created. We watch storms and lighting in a colourful composition, connected to your TV or radio and maybe there is a fight going on. And sometimes you’re just being manipulated. Which is great, and it’s part of every director’s craft. (Desistfilm, 2015)",
