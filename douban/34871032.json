Having found themselves without equipment, they send the young Mikhas to mechanic Bugreev. He is accompanied by Sazon Ivanovich, who is also cooperating with Germans – by the secret task of partisans. They come to the lodge, where equipment is hidden, build a fire and start to clarify explosive. Sudden arrival of Germans crushes the heroes’ plan…Full-length debut of Victor Turov, which layed the basis for aesthetics of Belorussian “partisan cinema”. In 1995 the film was included in the list of 100 best war films by UNESCO.\"",
