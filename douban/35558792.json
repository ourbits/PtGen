    "introduction": "Any man showing an interest in Mollie is usually warned that she’s a heartbreaker. Mollie, a psychologist specializing in divorces and separations, doesn’t do happily-ever-after, doesn’t believe in fate, and is allergic to the idea of ‘the one’. When she meets Otis in her local pub, however, there are a few more butterflies than she’s happy to admit to. Her natural reaction is to run for the hills. But then it turns out that Otis is the new colleague she’s supposed to be training and avoiding him is no longer an option. When Mollie’s workmates try to persuade her to give love a chance, she’s fiercely resistant. Will Mollie finally relinquish her precious ‘happy single’ status, or will she flee after all?",
