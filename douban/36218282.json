    "introduction": "TMWQ is a contemporary reworking of Robert Musil’s 1941 novel “The Man Without Qualities”. Selected passages from the book were matched with Instagram users' photos. Musil’s novel is a prescient meditation on the loss of the Real: “A world of qualities without a man has arisen, of experiences without the person who experiences them, and it almost looks as though ideally private experience is a thing of the past, and that the friendly burden of personal responsibility is to dissolve into a system of formulas of possible meanings.” TMWQ sheds a new light on the politics of images today by creating a conversation across time between a literary classic and social media.源自：https://www.annoren.com/tmwq",
