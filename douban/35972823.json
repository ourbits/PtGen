    "introduction": "Based on one of the most tragic and complex events in Colombia’s history, the takeover of the Palace of Justice by the M-19 guerrilla group on November 6, 1985, Noviembre presents an acutely political cinematic exercise.Director Tomás Corredor reconstructs the most intense moments of the siege through fiction, the drama unfolding in a single confined space — a bathroom inside the Palace — and relying on a precise narrative device. The story takes place almost entirely within that one bathroom, where members of the M-19 hold a group of hostages: magistrates, court officials, and administrative and service staff. From this enclosed setting the film escalates in tension, while outside we hear — and feel — the military assault led by the Colombian Army as they attempt to retake the building.",
