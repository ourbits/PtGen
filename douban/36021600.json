    "introduction": "Political activist and pop star Bobi Wine is the young generation’s hope for the future in Uganda, where the opposition leader’s path to the presidency starts with popular protest songs that go viral in the ghetto.The price of challenging Uganda’s incumbent president is high. After nearly 40 years in power, Yoweri Museveni has no intention of handing over power to opposition leader Bobi Wine and his young followers, mobilising the police, army and press in a dirty battle for power. The directing duo Moses Bwayo and Christopher Sharp have followed Wine (whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi) and his wife Barbi over several years. The result is an epic and riveting drama about power, vanity and democracy in the vast African country that was once a pioneer of the continent – and may be again.源自：https://cphdox.dk/film/bobi-wine-the-peoples-president/",
