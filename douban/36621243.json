    "introduction": "Zeca begins his morning surrendered to the small setbacks—he finds it harder and harder to get, has a one-and-a-half hour trip by bus to the school where he works and, along the way, shortcomings complicate matters even more. But he doesn’t know that that day, which looks exactly like the rest, his routine is going to break—not only because he is going to get fired, but also because an unexpected connection with Luisa, the coworker who announces the news and who, a little bit out of compassion, offers him a ride home, could maybe help him lighten up the trip, in more than one sense. O dia que te conheci is a deeply humanistic film, which sketches, with care and respect, the portrait of two characters with very real jobs, bodies and concerns. A highway in rush hour, a sincere talk, a few glasses of beer in the street—sometimes that is all people need to find one another.源自：https://www.mardelplatafilmfest.com/38/en/pelicula/o-dia-que-te-conheci",
