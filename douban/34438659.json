    "introduction": "It's a video of a Chinese family discussing and arguing about what to do with a relative with some kind of severe illness or injury who is in ICU but will soon either die or be in a vegetative state. It's one long (uninterrupted?) shot with the family bickering but mostly saying the same few things over and over. It\\'s probably somewhere between ethnography and psychology, with the comparatively calm or inscrutability of the people compared to how this would play out in a western setting being the most striking aspect to me.",
