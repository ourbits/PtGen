    "introduction": "A dark romantic fairytale about a young woman, 'Clara', who is involved in a car crash with her husband, 'Morten'. As she wakes up in her partial sighted state, she realises that the accident has drastically changed their relationship and their lives. Clara spirals into a breakdown, isolating herself from everyone, becoming almost agoraphobic. Seeing this, Morten insists they should move on and start a new life. Not being able to see since the accident, Clara seeks solace in her familiar surroundings, she feels vulnerable and increasingly suspicious of Morten's motives. Gradually, as Morten tries to get her to understand the reality of how things have changed for them, she begins to experience flashbacks from the car accident which hint at a hitherto unknown truth.
