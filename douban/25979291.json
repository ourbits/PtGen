Daddy turns off at a gas station, orders the girls to stay in the car. But as soon as he's gone, Jodie protests. Her name's not Jodie. Just then, she looks down and gasps. She has become a woman, and Daddy must not find out! Lisa struggles to cover up her sister's secret while playing the twisted role of daughter to a wide-eyed attendant and a suspicious Sheriff at this lonely gas station. But when push comes to shove, will Lisa be able to break character or will she forever remain a victim of Daddy's special brand of love?",
