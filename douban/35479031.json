    "introduction": "A little boy dreams of becoming a professional hockey player. Unfortunately, one day he is forced to give up on his passion. His love for sports is revived after several decades when he has his own son. While shopping for a Christmas gift for the boy, the man’s childhood memories return; the main player in them is his constantly drunk father. In this low-key and minimalist animation the present is intertwined with flashbacks. A hockey game to the rhythm of the Russian ‘Kalinka’ song is not only about dreams but also about building a relationship between a father and a son.",
