    "introduction": "In 2019, Marina Voica stars in a short film directed by Andrei Răuţu, and since then, Andrei refuses to leave her alone. Initially, Marina agrees to shoot a music video with Andrei, and later, the idea of making a documentary. However, she is not entirely satisfied with the way he films her. The interaction between the camera and the character unfolds as a battle of unmasking, in which the director seems to lose to the Romanian music diva, unsure of how to relate to her: as a grandmother or as a vibrant artist.",
