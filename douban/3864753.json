    "introduction": "I got this under the title SPECIAL SQUAD SHOOTS ON SIGHT. I've been slowly watching this movie over the past year in 5 minute increments and I finally finished it tonight. It is a Turkish/Italian co production starring the perfectly named Tony Tiger (real name Irfan Atasoy) as a reporter/part time cop/hypnotist (!) who is blackmailed into working for some small time crooks led by Gordon Mitchell, who sounds like Popeye in this. The gang's goal is to steal a mystical Golden Buddha with the help of Tony's hypnotic powers. The film is needlessly convoluted, with mysterious phone calls where you don't know who is on the other end and characters popping up that you have no idea who they are. It also doesn't help that Tony and the other male lead (a cop whose name I have already forgotten) look almost exactly the same.",
