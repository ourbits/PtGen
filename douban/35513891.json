    "introduction": "Through the images of her own film, the filmmaker seeks not only to remake the identity broken by the illness suffered by her grandmother, but also her own as an extension of that one. Trapped between the walls of the home, in what is revealed as a vital and existential confinement, only the dog will act as a connecting vehicle with the outside world.",
