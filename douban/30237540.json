She lived by them, she taught them, and she funneled them into her art to become one of the greatest actors of the 20th century. The woman lionized by her peers, loved and feared by her friends and spouses, and hailed by critics as \"The Female Brando\" is virtually unknown. THE NEEDS OF KIM STANLEY, seeks to reveal this amazing artist's neglected history and her incalculable contribution to the art of acting.",
