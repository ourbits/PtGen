    "introduction": "The Limits of Vision is a period piece featuring a \"mad\" housewife, Marcia, a twenty-something South Londonite, whose whimsical notions about dust and dirt take a dark turn when she hosts coffee morning. It's a story about art, metaphysics, obsessive compulsion and second wave feminism. Told through a fascinating character —an ingenious but profoundly conflicted individual, who comes unstuck amid the transformation of gender rules in 1970s suburban London. With cameo appearances by Charles Darwin, Pieter de Hooch and Pierre Tielhard de Chardin.",
