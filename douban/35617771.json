    "introduction": "THE MAN FROM KANGAROO was the third of Snowy Baker’s five Australian feature films, which were produced between 1918 and 1920. With Snowy’s physical prowess again to the fore, it was commercially successful in Australia, but received limited praise from the critics.Filmed in the beautiful Kangaroo Valley in New South Wales and Gunnedah in north-west NSW, the plot revolves around Snowy in the role of John Harland, a probationary vicar and ex-champion middleweight boxer.Robert V. Doerrer’s cinematography is serviceable and occasionally beautiful, and the Australian countryside and rural scenes provide plenty of spectacular space for Snowy’s exploits. Of special note are the particularly elaborate artwork titles by Syd Nicholls.",
