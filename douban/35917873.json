    "introduction": "'The Air in My Throat' shows a summer day in the life of Elle (12), but what has taken place in the previous months, shimmers through the house. Something is wrong with the family, but they just keep on living, without talking about it. Meanwhile Elle tries killing time. It's summer. It's hot. There is nothing to do. She wanders around the house, discovering clothes from her mother, molesting barbies and spying on the neighbors. In the meantime, the reality slowly seeps inside the house. The unsaid is like a veil on the family and it is the basis of the sorrow that Elle struggles with.",
