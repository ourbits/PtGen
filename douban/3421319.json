    "introduction": "Set against the backdrop of a suburban high school in Middle America, Beyond the Mat is the coming of age tale of Aaron Miller. Amidst the struggle of a disintegrating friendship, the tormenting of a crosstown wrestling rival, and the blossoming of a new love, Aaron is forced to come to terms with who he really is. Aarons friendship is put on the line when best friend Bo, blinded by the desire for a rematch against crosstown wrestling rival Dominic, robs Aaron of his spot on the varsity wrestling team. Aaron is torn between his loyalty to his friend and his commitment to his sport. Fueled by the desire to succeed and the need to prove himself, Aaron embarks on a journey of self discovery. At times, Aarons struggles on the mat mirror his struggles in daily life. His wrestling encounters are a physical manifestation of his emotional struggle, a metaphor for what he is going through. The drama culminates in an explosive finale at the State Wrestling Championship where more than just pride is on the line. Its a tale about two best friends, a chronicle about minority experiences in America, an uncensored look into the perilous world of high school wrestling, and ultimately the story of a teen who overcomes selfdoubt to find his true place.",
