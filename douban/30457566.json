Maya (Liron Ben-Shlush) is a struggling theater actress who scores a part playing a girl who suffers a mental breakdown. She spends time in a mental ward to research the part, but when reality conflicts with the dramatic paradigm, her methods create problems within the intimate relationship she shares with her director.",
