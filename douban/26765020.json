    "introduction": "The Six Queens of Henry VIII is the story of the Tudor King, rich in emotional and psychological drama, brought vividly to life through lavishly realised dramatic reconstruction and the duelling perspectives of two of Channel 5’s most vibrant historians. Suzannah Lipscomb and Dan Jones will lead us through the web of intrigue, scandal, romance, lust, betrayal and tragedy that characterised Henry’s six marriages.Suzannah and Dan will view the dramatic events of each union from the perspectives of man and woman, King and Queen.In each episode, Henry VIII and His Six Wives will bring to life the experiences of Henry’s Queens to see what they saw, feel what they felt, each time capturing Henry at a different stage of his life and reign. From the vigorous Renaissance prince eager to step out of his father’s shadow to the anxious middle-aged man desperate for an heir, to the irascible elder statesman in need of love and affection, the series will chronicle Henry’s life choices.",
