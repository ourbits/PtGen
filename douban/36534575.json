    "introduction": "Real World/Road Rules Challenge is the 2nd season of the MTV reality game show, The Challenge. The season is directly subsequent to Road Rules: All Stars.The season marked the first time in which \"Real World/Road Rules Challenge\" would be used as the show's main title. In addition, it's one of two seasons absent of a subtitle, a trend that wouldn't truly emerge until the show's 4th season.It is the first six-on-six Challenge in the series. The teams traveled via tour bus and RV starting in San Francisco, ending in Universal City, California, competing in different individual challenges. The winning team had the right to travel in a tour bus, while the losing team had to travel in an RV. Each time a team won an individual challenge, they won the right to spend time in a \"money machine\". The \"money machine\", set up outside Universal Studios Hollywood in Universal City, California was a huge wind chamber that contained up to $150,000. Whatever the casts could keep on them, they were guaranteed to keep. This season also featured an additional challenge where the two teams competed over possession of a teddy bear. Whichever team had the teddy bear in their possession at an unknown, predetermined point in the challenge, would win the additional challenge.",
