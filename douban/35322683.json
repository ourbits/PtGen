    "introduction": "Yanomami shaman, chief and spokesman Davy Kopernava has been fighting threats to nature, and when Brazilian President Bolsonaro declared that industry could set up store in Yanomami territory in the Amazon, his fight with his son escalated to the international level to defend their country against the invaders.He defended his people against endless colonization on a worldwide scale. And one of his best-selling books, \"Falling Skies: Words of a Yanomami Shaman\", describes the cultural oppression, environmental destruction, and deaths from epidemics and violence that resulted from his encounters with government officials, missionaries, and others.Do the Whites understand that the fall from the sky will not only crush the Yanomami?",
