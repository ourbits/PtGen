    "introduction": "Vincent is 13, just entering his teens. He's full of admiration for his father, who is unemployed and only really interested in football, claiming he'll soon be hired as a professional trainer. On the other hand, he barely shows any interest in his wife, and even less in his children. Vincent, who shares his passion for football, thinks he has a special relationship with his father, and is very proud of this. Vincent's mother bears all the burden of taking care of the family, up to the day when she hits rock-bottom and tries to commit suicide, ending up in hospital with depression. Vincent, 10-year-old Clément, and 7-year-old Clara now turn to their father for their care. But he clearly has no intention of assuming his role as a father. Separated from his mother and abandoned by an inadequate father, Vincent will have to take care of Clément and Clara himself. Little by little he comes to understand that the father he saw as a hero is nothing more than a boastful, lying, irresponsible, and selfish man. Tired of waiting for something which is never going to happen, Vincent chooses to take things in hand himself.",
