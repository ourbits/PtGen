    "introduction": "Eric was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. He attended Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute (the same school Mike Meyers attended) and Sir John A. Collegiate High school. With the support of his parents (his father was also an aspiring actor), Eric spent three years at the Ryerson Theater School in Toronto and the Banff Center for the Arts, and went on to spend five seasons with Canada's Stratford Festival - he graduated 'lead' status in such stage classics as \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\", \"Henry V\" and \"The Three Sisters\". Eric then moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where he also moved into television and movies and gained a devoted following of fans. Eric makes his home in both Vancouver and Los Angeles.He became a US citizen, and now holds dual citizenship with the US and Canada.A graduate for Ryerson University's School of Theatre (Toronto)Son, Finnigan Holden McCormack, born 1 July 2002 in Los Angeles.Sang both the American and Canadian national anthems at the 2004 NHL All Stars game in Minnesota.Attended Stephen Leacock Collegiate Institute High School in Scarborough, Canada. It is the same high school that Mike Myers went to.Set up his own production company called Big Cattle Productions to develop ideas for TV. The name of his company came about, as is usually the case for Eric, out of humor. By shortening the word production you get Big Cattle Prod.Named his son Finnigan after the puppet in \"Mr. Dressup\" (1967). He refers to his acting repertoire as his \"tickle trunk\" also from that show.The producers of the \"Highlander\" (1992) television series liked Eric's performance in \"Lonesome Dove: The Series\" (1994) so much that they created a character specially for him. In the Highlander episode Manhunt, McCormack played Matthew McCormick, an immortal working as a federal who tracks serial killers. The producers were so happy with this episode they considered giving Eric his own spin-off series.Has a sister named Ellen.",
