    "introduction": "姬丝·阿奎诺Kristina Bernadette Cojuangco Aquino-Yap (born February 14, 1971 in Quezon City) (age 36) is a prominent television and movie personality in the Philippines.She is the fifth and youngest child of former president Corazon Aquino and Benigno Aquino, Jr., a popular opposition senator during the Ferdinand Marcos regime. She is the youngest of five siblings: Maria Elena, Aurora Corazon, Benigno the III (who currently represents Tarlac in the Philippine House of Representatives) and Victoria Eliza.In recent years, Aquino has been labeled the Philippines's \"Queen of Talk,\" due to her success in hosting talk shows. She was crowned as the 2004 Box Office Queen for her hit movies such as Feng Shui and So... Happy Together.In 2006, she regained the same Box Office title for her movie Sukob, which is said to be the highest-grossing Filipino film of the year.Early lifeIn the infamous 1978 parliamentary elections where her father was a candidate, the seven-year-old Aquino wooed the crowds as a stand-in for her imprisoned father at campaign rallies. Aquino spent most of her elementary school days in the United States because the Aquino family was in exile. After the assassination of her father in 1983, Aquino returned to the Philippines and was a precocious presence in rallies against the Marcos regime.After the 1986 revolution that removed President Ferdinand Marcos from power, the teenaged Kris stepped into the limelight, starting with guest spots on television dramas and comedies, as well as talk shows. Finally, she made her film debut with actor-comedian Rene Requiestas in the comedy Pido Dida. This movie was a blockbuster hit and made Kris the box office queen for that year.Aquino afterwards had a commercially steady, though critically panned career",
