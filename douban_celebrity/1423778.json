    "introduction": "Personal Quotes:The act of surrendering yourself to someone else, is about trust (to me anyway) and should come from a genuine place... other than fear.[on picking stage name] I just found out that Evelyn Claire translates to Light Light. (laughs) That's kind of fun but I always liked the name 'Evelyn' and 'Claire' is a beautiful name as well.I'm from the coast. My mom is super independent. She always drilled independency into me. She was a big influence. In school, I was a little artist, a drama kid. I was directing plays.I always was considered a top student who excelled in any class or project that took just a pinch of creativity. My high school drama and film teacher (retired now) was considered one of the BEST in the district and many of his students ended up winning scholarships for big performing arts schools.",
