When he was a few months old, Ryan moved to a farm outside the small town of Foam Lake, Saskatchewan. His parents bought the town theater, and soon they moved into the condo above it. Ryan spent the following years growing up surrounded by movies of every kind. This fueled his creativity, and was soon writing his own stories and screenplays. In the summer of 1997, he and his mother and sister moved out to British Columbia, where he then went to Stelly's High School, in Victoria. There, he took part in an extra curricular cinematography club.
