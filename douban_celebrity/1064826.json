In 2010, Banks was inducted (as a member of Genesis) into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.In 2015, he was named \"Prog God\" at the annual Progressive Music Awards.Banks is ranked number 11 on MusicRadar's greatest keyboard players of all time.Banks was one of the main composers of Genesis's music and made major lyrical contributions to the band's songs. As the band's keyboardist he used a variety of instruments, including the ARP Pro Soloist synthesiser, the Mellotron, the Yamaha CP-70, and the Hammond T-102 organ. In the band's earliest years Banks would play acoustic guitar for some of the mellow and pastoral songs.Outside Genesis, Banks has pursued a solo career, which has included film scoring, pop songs and orchestral music. In 2006, the first Tony Banks biography, Man of Spells by journalist Mario Giammetti, was published in Italy (Edizioni Segno).",
