    "introduction": "Jane Arden (29 October 1927 – 20 December 1982) was a Welsh film director, actress, screenwriter, playwright, songwriter, and poet.Arden's work became increasingly radical following her growing interest and involvement in feminism and the anti-psychiatry movement of the 1960s. This is particularly evident from 1965 onwards, starting with the television drama The Logic Game, which she wrote and starred in. The Logic Game, which was directed by Saville, also starred the British actor David de Keyser who worked alongside Arden again in the film Separation (1967). Arden, again, wrote the screenplay and the film was directed by her creative partner Jack Bond (born 1937). Separation, which was photographed in atmospheric black and white by Aubrey Dewar, also featured music by the chart-topping British group Procol Harum.Arden and Bond had previously worked on the documentary film Dalí in New York (1966), which mainly consists of the surrealist artist Salvador Dalí and Arden walking the streets of New York City discussing Dalí's work. This film was resurrected and shown at the 2007 Tate Gallery Dalí exhibition.Arden's television work in the mid-1960s included appearances in Saville's Exit 19, Jack's Russell's The Interior Decorator, and the satirical programme That Was the Week That Was, hosted by David Frost.Arden's work in experimental theatre in the late 1960s and the 1970s coincided with her return to cinema as an actor, writer and director (or co-director).The play Vagina Rex and the Gas Oven (1969), starring Victor Spinetti, and Sheila Allen, played to packed houses for six weeks at London's Arts Lab. It was described by Arthur Marwick, in his book The Sixties as \"perhaps the most important single production\"[3] at the venue during that period. Also around this time Arden wrote the drama The Illusionist.In 1970, Arden formed the radical feminist theatre group Holocaust and then wrote the play A New Communion for Freaks, Prophets and Witches.
