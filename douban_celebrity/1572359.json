    "introduction": "Matthew Friend is an old soul living inside a 23-year-old comedian/actor/impressionist's body. Matthew graduated from NYU's Gallatin School in 2020, but his love of comedy and entertainment was sparked when he was four years old. He had watched Austin Powers (yes, as a four-year-old) and started mimicking the characters' voices-and the rest was history. To date, Matthew has over 400K followers on TikTok. He has appeared on the Today Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live, NBC's New York Live TV, Good Day LA, Good Day NY, Good Morning Washington, and WGN. In 2019, Matthew won Kenan Thompson's Ultimate Comedy Experience at Carolines on Broadway. His professional experience includes hosting HQ Trivia, performing at corporate events, and doing stand-up comedy throughout the country. Matthew's repertoire includes more than 250 impressions ranging from Rami Malek to Timothee Chalamet. His favorite to do right now is Jennifer Coolidge.",
