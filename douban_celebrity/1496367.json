    "introduction": "Donny Lucas was born, adopted, and raised in Montreal, Quebec. He caught the acting bug at age 9 seeing the movie '\"Superman\", and for the first time, realizing that the actor, a storyteller, could take you on an incredible journey. \"How cool is that\"?! In years to come Donny realized that he would not be the first person of color to play for the Montreal Canadians... 'Still a little disappointed.'And when four years as an amateur boxer seemed to be only leading to more black eyes and fat lips, Donny started his acting career in 1986 by taking classes, workshops, community theater, getting an agent, and most important, inspiring others. His first credits were for HBO, Warner Bros, and Nickelodeon. For a little dude from the neighborhood, it was pretty epic to be working on these big Hollywood productions.A move to Vancouver in 1994 opened up some great new opportunities as well. Donny would host reading groups at his house, produce and work in short and independent films, constantly continue to build his resume with film, TV, and voiceover credits.Donny is grateful to have worked with some of the best writers, directors, actors, and producers working today.",
