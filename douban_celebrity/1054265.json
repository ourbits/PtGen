    "introduction": "Lois Weber (June 13, 1879 – November 13, 1939) was an American silent film actress, screenwriter, producer, and director, who is considered \"the most important female director the American film industry has known\",[1] and \"one of the most important and prolific film directors in the era of silent films\".[2][3] Film historian Anthony Slide asserts that: \"Along with D.W.
