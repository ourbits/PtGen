    "introduction": "Austin's first moment on the stage was actually in his living room, teaching himself how to mimic his favorite actors and putting on his own shows for his family. Celebrities and other various character impressions were his go-to bits. Later, his stage moved from his living room to the classroom, and he soon bore the title of class clown. After his class clown days, he was drawn to a real stage and made his way into the stunt cast at Old Tucson. In the 8.5 years he worked there, he performed daily shows acting and stunts, falls ranging from 10 to 50 feet in height. In 2015 he became the Entertainment Lead at Old Tucson and began training others in both acting and stunt work.In his later years at Old Tucson he began transitioning from live western acting and stunts into the Film and Television industry, both acting and Stunt Coordinating. His credits include Widow, Cassidy Red, The West and the Ruthless, No Sunday West of Newton, Josephine, Mercy Street, Deadly Shootouts and many more.Now located in California, Austin continues to work and chase his dream.",
