    "introduction": "Born in Denver, Colorado, USA in 1969, he studied film and works as a writer, director and producer. He and his wife Erin Wilkerson founded the Creative Agitation political art collective and went on to direct the film Nuclear Family which screened in the 2022 Berlinale Forum. His internationally recognised body of filmmaking, produced with modest resources and as self-sufficiently as possible, crosses the boundaries between documentary and fiction film, performance and activism. In 2015, the film magazine “Sight & Sound” named Wilkerson “the political conscience of American cinema”.",
