    "introduction": "Lancelot Ncube was born in Zimbabwe 1996. He left Africa when he was just three. He ended up in Greece and in 2010 his moved further north to Sweden. Through his love for books and hip hop, he quickly understood how powerful language can be. With language, Lancelot learned to adapt and blend into the very different societies he was brought to. In Sweden, he picked up not just the Swedish language but also a love for acting. At 18 he was one of twelve that was chosen out of 1500 applicants to attend the highly prestigious Dramatic Institute in Stockholm. He is a keen watcher of the world, listening intently before he explodes out in graphic reenactments of what he has just learned. He is raw talent and has already acted on Swedens national stage, appeared in a feature film and was cast-ed in Swedens biggest drama on TV.",
