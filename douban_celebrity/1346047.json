    "introduction": "Overview (2)Date of Birth\t10 March 1997, Vancouver, CanadaHeight\t 5' 5\" (1.65 m)Mini Bio (1)Madeleine Arthur, the little 6 year old girl with the big blue eyes fell in love with acting when she was awarded her first role as \"Oliver\" in a stage production of \"Oliver Twist\". At the time she could only read French, so she had to rely on her fellow budding thespians to translate the script for her. After catching the \"acting bug\", she then went on to appear in many commercials, music videos and theatre productions.It was almost a decade later when Madeleine landed her first substantial role as a guest star in the HUB's R.L.Stine's The Haunting Hour. And it was then, at age fifteen, that Madeleine decided to seriously follow her passion and give acting a go. Her hard work paid off, and in 2013, Madeleine booked several roles. These included a guest star role in the Hub's Spooksville, a role on Fox /AMC's The Killing, and a role in Sony's Grace: The Possession, directed by Jeff Chan.",
