I grew up in South Bend, Indiana and later moved to Los Angeles to pursue my dream as an actress.I have been a proud member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) since 1996 but started my career in modeling at the age of 16. I feel very blessed to be part of such an exciting industry. I am still active in both modeling and acting and recently got involved in writing and producing.I have lived in Los Angeles, New York, and Miami. I currently reside in Los Angeles.A few exciting updates... I was recently in an episode for the new Showtime series called \"HOMELAND\". My character's name was \"Demmie\". I also co-starred in a TV Movie for NBC called \"GAME TIME: TACKLING THE PAST\" I played \"Karen Walker\". It aired on NBC Sept. 3, 2011 and is now available on DVD.I am surrounded by a loving family, I have great friends, and I consider myself to be very blessed. I also have 3 cats that I adore. I do all I can to support animal charities and organizations, and I am also a big supporter of cancer charities - my brother Shane is a 2 time cancer survivor...and my hero. He just had a stem cell transplant and has an amazing story. Check out his inspirational video: www.shanevarga.comThank you for taking the time to visit my site.  Love and Blessings.",
