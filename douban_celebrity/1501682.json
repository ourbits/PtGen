    "introduction": "Marianne's dramatic debut was in the back yard of a missionary school on the tropical island of Madagascar. Her love of performing moved on from Africa's East coast to the icy tundras of Norway, where she battled the other native Vikings who desired to be seen and heard. Being the revolutionary Viking that she is; she hopped on a boat (plane), and plundered (legally paid for) her way to the Americas. Her search for adventure continued under the masterful tutelage of Mr. Burt Reynolds himself. After a few years of living the dream in Florida Marianne finally found her way to LA. She loves residing in LaLaLand and hopes to one day be able to use her acting to save all the puppies and kittens and children of this world.",
