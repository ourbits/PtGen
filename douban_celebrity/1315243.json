    "introduction": "Gattlin Griffith began auditioning at the tender age of seven years old. His first attempt at acting followed in the footsteps of his father, stuntman Tad Griffith, when he auditioned for a commercial role requiring stunt work. While he did not get that part, Gattlin did catch the eye of the casting director who had him audition for a national commercial for Yamaha motorbikes. Gattlin got the part and soon after booked a series of television commercials for Home Depot. Following that, his first TV series appearance came on \"Untold Stories of the E.R.\" in 2006 and his career took off from there. Gattlin went on to appear in hit television shows such as \"Cold Case,\" \"How I Met Your Mother,\" \"Monk,\" \"Supernatural,\" and \"Criminal Minds.\" Proving he had talent far beyond his years, Gattlin made his feature film debut opposite Angelina Jolie in the Academy Award nominated film \"Changeling.\" To date, Gattlin has appeared in nearly a dozen films, most notably: \"Couples Retreat\" for Universal Pictures opposite Vince Vaughn, \"The New Daughter\" with Kevin Costner for Mandate Pictures, and \"Green Lantern\" opposite Tim Robbins for Warner Brothers. When he's not acting, Gattlin is an accomplished equestrian gymnast and 4th generation trick rider whose grandparents, Dick and Connie Griffith, are in the Pro Rodeo, National Cowboy and Cowgirl Halls of Fame. Gattlin's first exhibition rodeo was in January of 2012 at the Forth Worth Stock Show and Rodeo with two of his younger brothers, Callder and Arrden. Gattlin resides outside of Los Angeles with his parents and is eldest of four boys. He is an avid football and soccer player and makes sure he has his football on set with him at all times.",
