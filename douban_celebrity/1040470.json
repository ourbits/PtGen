    "introduction": "A successful playwright, Marguerite Bertsch was hired by Vitagraph in 1913 as a screenwriter. After writing several successful pictures for the studio, she was given the chance to direct, at first with a co-director (William P.S. Earle) on The Law Decides (1916), then on her own with The Devil's Prize (1916). She directed four films altogether, and later published a book about how to make movies. She left the business in 1918, and died in 1967 at age 77.",
