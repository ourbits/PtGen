    "introduction": "Andres was born in Bogotá D.C., Colombia, and later moved to the United States. Unlike many actors, Andres never dreamed of acting when he was growing up. He never participated in plays in high school or took any acting classes during his high school years. His first experience related to the industry was taking classes in theatre and cinema writing.Andres worked as a lawyer before moving to Bali, Indonesia, where he started modeling. One day his agent pitched him the idea to audition for a movie, and he got cast in Dev Patel's directorial debut, \"Monkey Man,\" in a non-speaking role. The environment on set changed his perspective about life and what he wanted to do. Since then he has been committed to acting. He has taken acting classes from some of the best in the industry and moved to the United States to pursue his dream of becoming a great actor.",
