She then trained for several years at the Royal Academy for Dramatic Arts, then she joined a group of other recently graduated students to form the Everyman Theatre in Liverpool.Gabrielle stayed at the Everyman for three years and then became the youngest acting member during the reopening season of the famed Malvern Theatre Company. Afterwards she joined the Birmingham Repertory Company and perfected her craft at Manchester's Royal Exchange, the Bristol Old Vic, the New Shakespeare Company and The Young Vic in productions as diverse as \"The Cherry Orchard\", \"Titus Andronicus\", \"A Phoenix Too Frequent\" and \"Comedy of Errors\".Gabrielle made her television debut in Intrigue (1966) and then guested in \"The Hidden Tiger\", an episode of The Avengers (1961).
