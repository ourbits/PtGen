    "introduction": "Jacques Peretti is an investigative journalist and broadcaster. His BBC series The Men Who Made Us Fat and follow-up, The Men Who Made Us Spend examined the historical roots and real causes of the obesity crisis and consumerism, respectively. His new series, airing in January, tackles inequality: what is really driving it, and why it has been accepted as inevitable.Jacques has written for The Guardian, Wired and the Huffington Post. He is currently writing a book about the ideology of risk and how it changed our world. He lives in London, and occasionally uses his hands to try and fix things around the house, with disastrous results.",
