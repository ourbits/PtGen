    "introduction": "Revealed by Joshua Z Weinstein in his excellent semi-documentary Menashe (2017), Menashe Lustig, born in 1980, is living in New Square, New York. He is a fervent disciple of Rabbi Twersky, the chief rabbi of the Hasidic movement. Lustig lived for seven years in London until, following the demise of his wife, he decided to come back to New Square, where he became a grocery clerk. He unfortunately had his son taken away from him for not wanting to re-marry. All those personal experiences inspired Weinstein who made a fine film out of the ordeals he went through.",
