    "introduction": "Joyce Diane Brothers (née Bauer; October 20, 1927 – May 13, 2013) was an American psychologist, television personality and columnist, who wrote a daily newspaper advice column from 1960 to 2013. In 1955, she became the only woman ever to win the top prize on the American game show The $64,000 Question, answering questions on the topic of boxing, which was suggested as a stunt by the show's producers. In 1958, she presented a television show on which she dispensed psychological advice, pioneering the field.[1] She wrote a column for Good Housekeeping for almost forty years and became, according to The Washington Post, the \"face of American psychology\".[1] Brothers appeared in dozens of television roles, usually as herself, but from the 1970s onward she accepted roles portraying fictional characters, often self-parodies.Radio therapist Dr. Laura credited Brothers with making psychology \"accessible\".[2]",
