    "introduction": "Lithuanian-born Ivan Lebedeff was educated at the University of St. Petersburg. He was slated for a diplomatic career in the Imperial Lyceum at Tsarskoye Selo - a natural progression, since his aristocratic father was a highly-placed advisor to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia. However, the outbreak of World War I changed all that. Ivan enlisted as a volunteer in the Third Regiment of the Imperial Dragoons and was soon decorated and promoted after capturing a German general near Pskov, at the small town of Nevel. He was wounded in action on more than one occasion, as well as suffering from the effects of mustard gas. Transferred to the Romanian front, he found himself deserted by nearly everyone under his command as the Russian Revolution took hold.Ivan and other Tsarist supporters made their way to Odessa on the Black Sea, which had been occupied by French and allied forces. Ivan was made impromptu food administrator for the beleaguered city, but was soon captured and imprisoned after the Bolsheviks forced an allied withdrawal. Being a resourceful chap, he was able to escape, and, briefly, led another White Russian contingent in what was - by now - clearly a futile campaign. Ivan eventually slipped across the Turkish border and found sanctuary in Constantinople. From there, he went on to Vienna and then Germany, where he found his first acting opportunities. He later proceeded to Paris, where a chance meeting with legendary director D.W. Griffith led to his being cast as Amiel in The Sorrows of Satan (1926).",
