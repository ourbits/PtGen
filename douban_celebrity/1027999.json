She allegedly once won a \"Miss Autoville\" contest and won a car only to sell it in order to move to and study acting in London. A minor break for her occurred in the James Bond film series. She played a gypsy girl in From Russia with Love (1963) and then later appeared again in Thunderball (1965). After playing in the well-tanned minority ranks for years, Martine finally got noticed after catfighting with Raquel Welch in One Million Years B.C. (1966). She become part of the Hammer Studio horror assembly line for a time, which usually had her in various stages of undress. In the 1970s, she went to Hollywood and other than playing Xaviera Hollander in The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood (1980) and several television series (Fantasy Island (1977), Hart to Hart (1979), The Fall Guy (1981), Buffalo Bill (1983), Sledge Hammer!
