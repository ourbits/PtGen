    "introduction": "Lab has written & directed films for Film London, BBC Writersroom, B3 Media for the UK Film Council and the BFI. His short film My Dad the Communist was singled out by the UK Film Council as one of the standout films of the year. His debut feature film Nine Dead Gay Guys starred Steven Berkoff and was hailed by the Observer as “the most shocking film at the Cannes Film Festival”. Lab’s most recent film is a collaboration with producer Chi Thai. Their film Automat was commissioned by the SKY ARTS 50 strand and examines the plight of immigrant workers in a large U.K. distribution centre.",
