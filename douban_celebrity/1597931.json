    "introduction": "Rachel Poletick (she/her) is an east coast based actor best known for her role as Kelly Dawson in “Mare of Easttown.” She earned her degree in theatre studies from Temple University, graduating with a BA as part of the acting concentration. While acting is her main focus, she also has experience in dance and modeling. Learning new material quickly, consistent hard work, and strong attention to detail are areas in which Rachel excels. There’s nothing she loves more than immersing herself in a project and getting the opportunity to tell stories by connecting with her character. In addition to “Mare of Easttown,” Rachel played Terry in “Brave the Dark”  and did ADR for “We Own This City.” Recently, she wrote and starred in the short film “Proximity.”",
