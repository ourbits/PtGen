The film was based on Patrick Wilde's stage play What's Wrong With Angry?, and is a love story between two British schoolboys. Silverstone made the front cover of Gay Times in May 1999 to mark the release of the film.The movie achieved cult-status with many fans, and even gave rise to two fan-organised gatherings in the filming locations around Basingstoke.[2] The events in themselves attracted the attention of the television media, as fans of the film travelled several thousand miles to the event.[3]Prior to Get Real, Silverstone was no stranger to film, as he had appeared in Adrian Lyne's adaptation of Lolita in 1997 and Mike Figgis' The Browning Version in 1994.Immediately after the release of Get Real, Silverstone went to Trinity College, Cambridge. While there, he acted in student productions of King Lear, The Whiteheaded Boy, The Duchess of Malfi, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, Near Miss, and The Winter's Tale. Silverstone left Cambridge in 2001 with a First class degree.Since 2001 Silverstone has appeared in numerous stage productions such as The Tempest and My Boy Jack and was nominated for both a The Times Theatre Award and an Evening Standard Theatre Award for his portrayal of Basil Anthony in the West End production of Man and Boy[4]His most recent film project is Jump! (2007), in which he starred as a young Jewish photographer charged with the murder of his father, based on the real life story of Philippe Halsman, opposite Patrick Swayze and Martine McCutcheon.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Silverstone",
