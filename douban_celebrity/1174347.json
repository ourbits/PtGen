    "introduction": "Robin garnered a Best Actress Award for the festival darling, \"Duck, Duck, Goose!\" and for the critically acclaimed web series, \"The Real Girl's Guide To Everything Else.\" As an improviser, she co-founded two NY-based groups and is a founding member of Skidmore College's Ad-Liberal Artists, with whom she also participated in the first three National College Comedy Festivals. After earning a B.A. In Psychology and training at Mike Nichols and Paul Sills' reputable New Actor's Workshop in NYC as well as IO West and the Groundlings in Los Angeles, Robin has gone on to perform in hundreds of stage, TV, indie movie and new media productions. Her multi-ethnic look and natural versatility allow her to play a large variety of roles, from an ass-kicking Italian spy in Jamison Newlander's critically acclaimed play, RCP, to a out of control crack addict in \"I Hate The Man In My Basement\", to a passionate Lebanese journalist in The Real Girl's Guide to Everything Else (2010) to a spunky, exotic romantic in the award-winning film, Duck, Duck, Goose! (2005). She garnered a Best Actress Award for each of the last two credits.",
