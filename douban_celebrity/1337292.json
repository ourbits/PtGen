    "introduction": "Francesca Ciardi is an Italian film actress. She was one of four actors whom the Italian police believed had been murdered in the making of the 1980 horror film Cannibal Holocaust. The film was considered so realistic, that shortly after the film was released, its director Ruggero Deodato was arrested for murder. The actors had signed contracts to stay out of the media for a year in order to fuel rumours that the film was a snuff movie. The court was only convinced that they were alive when the contracts were cancelled and the actors appeared on a television show as proof.",
