    "introduction": "Korczak 是波兰医生 Henry Goldszmit 的笔名，他著有儿童书籍，包括《马特一世国王》。更知名的是，他是华沙一家孤儿院的院长，他称该院为“儿童共和国”，在那里，他们的权利、声音、公平和尊重至关重要。尽管有些孩子还很小，但孩子们有议会、报纸和法院，可以学习参与公民事务、承担社区责任和关爱。1942 年，纳粹入侵波兰时，当局给了 Korczak 逃跑的机会，让他在被关押的孩子被送往集中营之前逃走。然而，在经历了华沙犹太区的贫困生活后，Janusz Korczak最终选择陪同华沙犹太区的孩子们一起前往特雷布林卡集中营，据说他们都死在了那里。这一勇敢的举动成为尊重儿童尊严的象征。In 1942 Janusz Korczak accompanied children of the Warsaw ghetto to the Treblinka concentration camp. That brave act became a lasting symbol of respect for the dignity of children. Korczak was the pen name of Polish doctor, Henry Goldszmit, an author of books for and about children including King Matt the First, and, most famously, the director of a Warsaw orphanage, which he called a \"republic of children,\" where their rights, their voices, fairness and respect were paramount. Though some were very young, the children had a parliament, a newspaper, and a court with which to learn participation in citizenry and communal responsibility and care. When the Nazis invaded Poland, Korczak was given the opportunity by the authorities to escape before his charges were sent to the camps. After surviving the deprivations of the Warsaw ghetto together, he accompanied the children to Treblinka where it is assumed they all perished.",
