    "introduction": "Sir Maejor (born May 28th 1988) is an American fashion model and actor from Atlanta, GA, best known for being the 2nd male albino actor and commercial fashion model. He hasn't been featured in any major campaigns, fashion publications, or hasn't co-starred in any blockbuster film as of yet, but is striving each day to make it to that milestone. Sir Maejor is hopeful that he will have the opportunity to work with GQ, Vogue Italia, Complex Magazine, Alexander McQueen and Givenchy. Sir Maejor wears many hats- he is a resident of Atlanta, Criminal Justice major, brand ambassador, marketer, and most importantly- someone who is diagnosed with albinism.",
