    "introduction": "Kristian is known for his stirring portrayals of an outsider. Flores' theatre credits include starring as Richard III and plays by Tennessee Williams and Russian playwrights. Kristian stars as Simon Elroy in School Spirits (2023) on Paramount+. As a series regular, his character grieves and investigates the death of his best friend, portrayed by Peyton List. His film debut was in the independent drama Me Little Me (2022), as Dex - a struggling, high-functioning bulimic at an Eating Disorder treatment facility. Kristian recurs in Reboot (2022) (20th Fox) as Connor in the series created by Steven Levitan. Darkening his trajectory, Flores accepted the part of Jack in Hulu's Grimcutty (2022) and a supporting role in an upcoming HBO Max science-fiction thriller. Kristian was awarded by the U.S. Congress for his portrayal of a prodigious gay dancer and victim of bullying in the play \"The Circles of Life.\" Eager to learn to dance, Kristian's skillset continues to increase with each role that demands it, so far: advanced skateboarding, piano, guitar, foreign languages, ballet, and fight combat. Previous roles showcase his comedic talent and intensely emotional performances. Kristian has a skill to humanize obscure characters. He is represented by Jennifer Patredis at Innovative Artists and managed by Vision Entertainment.",
