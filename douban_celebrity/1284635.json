    "introduction": "1964年出生于加拿大魁北克的Alma。Émile Gaudreault began his professional career writing and performing comedy on stage from 1986 to 1990 with Le Groupe Sanguin, directed by Robert Lepage. He then built a solid reputation by writing and directing shows for standup comics, including Michel Courtemanche. This led him to write for television and he was one of the writers on the series Un gars Une fille. For the big screen, he co-wrote Louis 19, le roi des ondes, which enjoyed the largest box office take in Canada in 1994. A remake entitled Edtv was later produced in Hollywood directed by Ron Howard. Gaudreault started his own directing career in 2001 with the comedy Nuit de noces and followed that with the the highly successful Mambo Italiano, from a script he co-wrote. The film was distributed in 30 countries. In 2004, he co-wrote Idole Instantanée, directed by Yves Desgagnés and in 2007, he co-wrote and directed Surviving My Mother, which won the Best Canadian film at the Montreal International Film Festival. De père en flic is his fourth feature film.",
