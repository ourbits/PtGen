I have been acting for the past 4+ years. My background in the Greek Military has helped me gain roles as a detective and a leader in the Secret Service (Captain of the Mossad). Being stereotyped is not what I am looking for as an actor. I prefer diverse roles and I have had the opportunity to perform as: a chef, a husband and father in a mixed family, a bar owner with a slight taste of mafia, a juror, a wrestler & etc.My main influencers are: Bruce Willis,Mel Gibson, Harrison Ford, Al Pacino, Samuel L.Jackson, Robert De Niro, Brad Pitt, Leonardo Di Caprio as well as the great Martin Scorcese, Ridley Scott and Steven Spielberg.",
