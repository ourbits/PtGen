    "introduction": "Jarrett started off early in his acting career at the age of 4 after his mother was encouraged by Ed Asner that he'd be a natural. He quickly booked the first two jobs he auditioned for and kept up the pace for many years. Jarrett's interest in the field led to committee positions within SAG, attendance in Kevin Robert McDermott's masters' acting class, and finding opportunities for work whenever possible.His personal interests have always included a focus on technology, with dabbles in web design (especially helping fellow performers build and manage their presence), video game production, and computer building and repair. The latter has carried him into his current career in IT which covers his costs in caring for his two children while he contemplates a potential re-immersion into his childhood career.To keep up his acting bug, Jarrett performs in the amateur (although exceptionally well-produced) web series Mr. Deity on YouTube, as well as various side projects for the web, stage, podcasts, and fun. In 2015 Jarrett began training in improv at iO West in Hollywood where he's trained with such coaches as Brian James O'Connell, Craig Cackowski, and Paul Vaillancourt. After committing to his love of the art form, Jarrett co-founded The Feel Good Not Bad Death Laser with friends Josh Spence and David Coe, dedicated to the Deconstruction. They perform all over LA with regular shows at iO, Nerdist, and other theaters.",
