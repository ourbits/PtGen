    "introduction": "Long-time comic book artist, perhaps best known for his work at Marvel. At that company, Gene drew a revival of the Sub-Mariner in the mid-1960s; took over from artist Don Heck on Iron Man; took over from John Romita Sr. on Daredevil; spent time drawing Captain America; and launched a successful Marvel adaptation of Dracula. Fans appreciate his use of shadow for dramatic effect and his ability to draw romantic and action scenes. In the 1980s, he was successful on DC's Batman titles.",
