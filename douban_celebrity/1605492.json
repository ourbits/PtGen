    "introduction": "Liz Priestley was born (quite prematurely) in Philadelphia, PA. She was adopted by the Priestley family at a young age and grew up with five sisters in Abington, a suburb of Philadelphia. Her father, George, was an attorney and her mother, Linda, worked as his office manager. Liz and her siblings were all encouraged to study both musical instruments and Hollywood musicals of the 50s and 60s. This is when Liz' love of music and performing were born. In addition to learning to play the violin and piano, Liz began to star in her school plays at the Philadelphia Montgomery Christian Academy. This led to her winning a scholarship to study classical opera. Studying opera enabled Liz' skills to flourish and she considered a career in opera upon graduation. Although her parents pushed for her to continue on a path to music, Liz couldn't shake the 'acting bug'. She went on to study Musical Theatre at the prestigious Ithaca College, then moved to New York to pursue a career as an actor. Liz' acting career began with a bang. She was soon cast in multiple plays and commercials. An accomplished stage performer, Liz has appeared in over twenty-five theatre productions in Philadelphia, New York and Washington, D.C. as an actor, vocalist, violinist, pianist and dancer. She played Panzi Lew McVain in Long Time Since Yesterday with Company of Queens Acting Company in Philadelphia. Liz has performed as both a musician and solo opera performer with Philadelphia Young Artists Orchestra, Philadelphia Sinfonia II and with the Academy of Music. After changing her focus from stage to screen, Liz signed with a talent manger and quickly booked a small role on her first episodic television show. Shortly after, she landed her debut movie role in Concrete Cowboys, starring opposite Idris Elba and Caleb McLaughlin. In addition to continuing her film and television pursuits, Liz has also written and produced an original web series, and she is a mom to a wonderful daughter.",
