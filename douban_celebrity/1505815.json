    "introduction": "Baby was born in Oklahoma City, OK. but she has lived all over the United States. As a teenager she moved to Atlanta, Georgia which she still calls home. She was raised in a musical family and she caught the performing bug at an early age. She was named after her father's rock n' roll band, \"Baby\". Baby, who many entertainment insiders once called music's next major pop superstar, gained national exposure as a finalist on the WB TV series \"Pop Stars\". This singer, songwriter, dancer, actress, and model has garnished praise from such industry heavyweights as writer/producer Dallas Austin who called her \"the next Madonna\" and legendary producer David Foster who said, \"I think she is incredible and talented...She is going to do great!\" In addition to the above, Baby has also worked with an all star cast of hit making producers including C. Tricky Stewart (Rihanna, Mariah Carey, Michael Jackson), Dallas Austin (Madonna, Gwen Stefani, Janet Jackson), Ryan Waters (Sade, Liv Warfield), and Prince. She toured with Prince and also hosted his internet radio show, NPG Audio. Her first group was called Roxxi. Their music was a mix of R&B, Hip Hop, and Pop. They toured all over Europe and opened up for groups such as Destiny's Child and 112. After a few years of writing, recording, and touring with her group, Baby decided to branch out on her own and her solo music career was born.",
