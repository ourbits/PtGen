    "introduction": "Michael Robinson, born in 1981, is an artist based in Los Angeles. He holds a BFA from Ithaca College and an MFA from the University of Illinois at Chicago (U.I.C.), and he has taught at Binghamton University, Otis College of Art and Design, U.I.C., and the Schule Friedl Kubelka in Vienna. His work in film, video, and collage explores the joys and dangers of mediated experience, riding the fine lines between humor and terror, nostalgia and contempt, ecstasy and hysteria. His work has been shown in both solo and group exhibitions at a variety of museums, festivals, and galleries. Robinson is currently writing and developing his first feature-length film project, I’ll Be Thunder.",
