    "introduction": "Mike Li was born in Hong Kong, the only child of Josephine, an educator, and Eddie, a social worker. His first stage role was \"Officer #2\" in a high school production of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. Since going on to tackle character roles like \"Templeton\" in Charlotte's Web and \"Mercutio\", Mike jumped straight into acting classes after graduation and began auditioning before the age of 19. After finding small successes on shows like the CW's Arrow and Showcase's Travelers, he landed his first feature film role acting opposite Blake Lively in The Age of Adaline (2015); scenes that were ultimately cut for time. Mike made his proper feature film debut in the Dwayne Johnson blockbuster Skyscraper (2018).His first recurring role was playing a Yakuza on the third season of Amazon's The Man in the High Castle, which he followed up with a couple of appearances on CBS's Salvation season two. An avid video gamer, it was a dream come true for him to join the voice cast of United Front's \"Sleeping Dogs\" starring Will Yun Lee.Mike spends much of his time collaborating with fellow actors and filmmakers to write and produce his own projects, working part-time co-producing with Thought Swerve Media as well as his company, Fiasco Entertainment.",
