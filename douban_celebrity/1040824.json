    "introduction": "Devon Murray was born in County Kildare, Ireland in October 1988. His parents Michael and Fidelma Murray sent him to the Billie Barry when he was six, and within two weeks he landed a Tesco television ad. Within six months he was in his first movie, acting alongside Aidan Quinn in This Is My Father (1998/I). He then joined the National Performing Arts School and made his breakthrough in Angela's Ashes (1999). He also acted with Jane Seymour in Yesterday's Children (2000) (TV).He now plays Seamus Finnigan (one of Harry's Gryffindor House friends) in the much-hyped Harry Potter series. Devon is an only child and now lives in Celbridge, County Kildare (Ireland). He has horses, and enjoys riding them, as well as rollerblading, skateboarding and playing on his computer.",
