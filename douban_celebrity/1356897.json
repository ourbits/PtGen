She plays sorority dictator, Jacqueline Gill, in The Scarehouse, which was released by Universal Pictures across North America in 2015. Katherine just completed filming on Definition of Fear with Oscar winning producer Christopher Branch, starring along side Bollywood superstar Jacqueline Fernandez.
