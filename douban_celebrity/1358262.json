    "introduction": "A theatrical actor from New York, Reese Madigan will be forever known as the \"American Shaolin\" to martial arts film fans as he earned the titled role of the movie in 1991. Reese is a blackbelt in the art of Shotokan Karate and was fascinated by the Chinese culture - it was both his skills and acting that gave him the role. This was the only major role Reese would have in a film as he concentrates more on the stage today. However, in 2001, he had a small role in the independent feature Last Ball. Today, Reese still continues to enjoy success on the stage.",
