    "introduction": "After attending the drama conservatories of Grenoble, then the 16th arrondissement of Paris, the comedian joined the formation The Samovar, a school of circus and burlesque, that the troop The dogs of Navarre also attended. In parallel, the young talent performs on the boards of various theaters, with the poster of great classics, ranging from Chekhov to Genet. Satya Dusaugey is later on stage in a clownish solo: Me, Jean Patrick Patrick. On the cinema side, the actor discovers the sets through several short films, and even goes behind the camera in 2016 to make Tapette. The now filmmaker interprets Michel, who, for fear of engaging with his friend, is persuaded to be gay. But Satya's talents are revealed more to the general public in 2018, with Olivier Fox's Nu series, in which he takes the lead role. The comedian plays the character of Frank Fish, a policeman fresh out of an 8-year coma. During these few years, France has been pacified thanks to an unprecedented measure allowing more transparency: everyone must live naked. The visibility that gives him the series allows Satya Dusaugey to then get a role in Roulez jeunesse Julien Guetta, and thus share the poster with Eric Judor.",
