    "introduction": "Molly Peters was a gorgeous and voluptuous British blonde bombshell actress and model who alas only appeared in a handful of films and TV shows during her regrettably fleeting acting career in the mid 60s. Molly was born in 1942 in Walsham-le-Willows, Suffolk, England. Peters started out as a model; among the men's magazines she graced the covers of and/or posed in pictorials for are \"Playboy,\" \"Modern Man,\" \"Calvalcade,\" \"Beau,\" \"Ace,\" \"Parade,\" \"Best for Men,\" \"Dapper,\" and \"Escapade.\" Molly achieved her greatest enduring cult cinema popularity with her memorably sensuous portrayal of Patricia Fearing, the fetching masseuse who gets seduced by James Bond at the Shrubland health club in \"Thunderball.\" She was discovered by director Terence Young and has the distinction of being the first Bond girl to be seen taking her clothes off on screen. In the wake of her 007 stint Peters acted in two more movies and popped up on episodes of the TV shows \"Armchair Theatre\" and \"Baker's Half-Dozen.\" Molly Peters had her acting career abruptly cut short after reportedly having a falling out with her agent.",
