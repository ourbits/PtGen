    "introduction": "Mini Bio (3)Sir Robert's career fell into two distinct parts. In the '60s, he was widely regarded as the heir of Laurence Olivier. But, after his departure from Britain's National Theatre in 1970 and the breakup of his marriage with Maggie Smith three years later, he suffered a slump made worse by heavy drinking. In the '90s, the Royal Shakespeare Company invited him to play first Falstaff in \"Henry IV\" and then Lear in \"King Lear\", and this re-established Stephens's career. He was knighted early in 1995.- IMDb Mini Biography By: Gil NeigerSir Robert Stephens was a flamboyant, award-winning Shakespearean actor who called himself 'knight errant.' One of his three ex-wives was the actress Maggie Smith with whom he acted in the 1960s and 1970s on stage and on film. Sir Robert faded from view for most of the late 1970s and 1980s, resurfacing in recent years to give fine Shakespearean performances. He was the recipient of the 1993 Olivier award.- IMDb Mini Biography By: AnonymousSir Robert Stephens, knighted in 1995, was a leading actor in the formative years of Britain's National Theatre and won fresh acclaim as a major Shakespearean performer late in his career.His career fell into two distinct parts. In the 1960s he was regarded as the heir of Sir Laurence Olivier. After his departure from the company in 1970, he went into a slump that was made worse by heavy drinking. Not until the 1990s, when the Royal Shakespeare Company invited him first to play Falstaff in \"Henry IV\" and then the title role in \"King Lear\", did he re-establish himself at the forefront of his profession. Maggie Smith was his third wife, the couple having performed together since at least 1965.- IMDb Mini Biography By: A. Nonymous",
