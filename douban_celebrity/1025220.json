    "introduction": "Jason was born and raised in Dublin, Ireland. After graduating from Trinity College Dublin with a BA in Drama and Theatre he moved to London, England, to further pursue his acting career. Time spent in British repertory theater led to major roles in some of Britain and Ireland's great theaters, including the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Almeida theater, London's West End (the Apollo and Comedy theaters) and the Gate Theatre, Dublin. Concurrently, he appeared in many British TV series for both the BBC and ITV. A move to the US in 2002 allowed Jason opportunities in Hollywood where he has played series regular roles on several network television shows. Jason and his family divide their time between the east and west coasts of America, and get back to visit Ireland as often as they can.",
