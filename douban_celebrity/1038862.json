    "introduction": "Francine Parker (December 18, 1925 – November 8, 2007) was an American television and film director, who was one of the first female members of the Directors Guild of America.[1] Parker was best known for her controversial documentary, F.T.A., which chronicled the antiwar entertainers tour, Free The Army tour (FTA), during the Vietnam War. The FTA tour and its documentary featured anti-Vietnam War celebrities Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland interacting very frankly with American soldiers.[1] Parker's film, which was released in 1972, was pulled from theaters within weeks of its release due to heavy criticism.[1] It has been rarely viewed since 1972.[1]",
