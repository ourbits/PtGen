    "introduction": "Bio视频分享专辑：（转载官网的）：http://www.youku.com/playlist_show/id_18802011.htmlYou might be familiar with J.P. Pitoc’s body of work, but chances are you might not recognize the guy from character to character. As that scruffy, “dreamy,” tattooed cremator on HBO’s SIX FEET UNDER and everything since what the New York Times called his “impressive feature debut” as a heartbreaking go-go boy in TRICK, versatility has been his game. J.P. has guest-starred on COLD CASE, NUMB3RS, CSI, NYPD BLUE, and GREY’S ANATOMY to name a few, as everything from drug-addled bonehead and responsible young dad to white trash burglar and wigga gangsta rapper. He even played the horn-dog nerdy sidekick in the the third installment of the Species trilogy. He refuses to be typed.A native of Queens, NY, a place J.P. is quick to point out is the most ethnically diverse borough on the planet, he is also the product of uniquely New York parentage. His mother was born and raised in Colombia, South America, and his father grew up near the Carpathian mountains of Transylvania. Shifting from one world to the next comes naturally to him. J.P. is classically trained with a degree in theater from NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts. J.P. also graduated from Manhattan’s prestigious Xavier High School, a Jesuit/military school known for its’ academic rigor. He attended on a full academic scholarship. During and after college, J.P. spent most of his time involved in the downtown New York theater scene, working on several occasions with 60’s theater legend Joseph Chaikin. He has travelled to Russia and Bulgaria to perform and study with theater troupes there, and upon graduation from NYU he and a group of his classmates formed a company that brought five shows in repertory to Scotland’s Edinburgh Theater Festival.J.P. is an avid boxer and kickboxer and, since relocating to California, has hit the waves just as hard.",
