    "introduction": "La La Land, Terminator Salvation, Westworld, SWAT. Those are just a few of the productions David Douglas has appeared in during his over twenty years in the acting industry. The youngest of Henley and Doreen Douglas' eight children, David Henley Douglas was born in San Jose, California. Growing up in Sunnyvale, David was a ball of energy in need of direction so noting his love for the film The Last Dragon, his parents signed him up for gymnastics and karate classes when he was nine. It was a decision that would eventually give David the career he has today.David excelled in martial arts and at 15 years old, he became an instructor for children and adults. Branching out, he began competing in 1995 as a member of the Paul Mitchell Karate and Ernie Reyes \"Next Generation\" action teams. In 1995, he was named National Black Belt League World Champion. He's won the ISKA International Forms Championship, was named the winner of the most National Grand Championships in 1996, won the Arnold Schwarzenegger Fitness Classic, and continues to tour nationally and internationally doing seminars and demonstrations. It was at one of those competitions that David had a chance meeting with Betty McCormick of Midwest Talent Management and his life changed forever.Under Betty's advisement, David packed his bags and moved to Los Angeles when he was 20. Within the matter of a few weeks, David was filming commercials for Pepsi, Ford, and McDonald's. He received another big break from casting directors Kim Davis and Justine Baddeley. The ladies thought he would be perfect as \"Rasta\" in the Drew Barrymore film Never Been Kissed. That appearance opened more doors for David and he soon found himself on his way as an actor. Since that appearance, David has gone on to do countless commercial spots as well as roles in The Last Ride opposite Dennis Hopper, The Fosters, New Girl, Fresh Off the Boat, American Crime Story, VEEP, Marvel's Agents of SHIELD, Scorpion, and more. Just having wrapped production on an episode of Here and Now and the feature film The Return of Mike and Ike, it's a safe bet that David Douglas' long-time dream of becoming an actor has come true. Whether it's on the big or small screen, his name and face are going to be around for a long time to come.",
