    "introduction": "Georgia is a Greek actress. She was born in Corfu and grew up in Athens. Her love for art was already perceived from a very early age. After studying ballet, marketing, writing a cookbook for children, after making a lot of ceramics for her kitchen, working as a model and starring in many commercials, her greatest love came to find her: acting. In 2016 she starred in the film \"Park\" by Sofia Exarchou and in 2019 she starred in her first series \"Ioannis Kapodistrias - His life and work\" by Yorgos Gikappeppas. Since then, her collaboration with the director is a definite success since the following year she chose her for the role of Roxandra Stourtza in the documentary \"La nuit Derniére\". In 2019, she gave her last performance as a ballerina in the well-known musical \"The Phantom of the Opera\" directed by Stephen Barlow, while in the same year she was shooting for the series \"The Generation of the '30s\" alongside Nikos Psarras, directed by Yorgos Gikapeppas.",
