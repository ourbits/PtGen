    "introduction": "Anton, the grandson of a renowned stunt man and rodeo cowboy, spent his childhood in backstage dressing rooms beside his single mother, a professional mime and children’s entertainer.A native of San Diego, Anton moved with his mother to Las Vegas at an early age. He struggled with being fatherless. But he loved to listen to his grandmother tell stories about his grandfather. She would talk about his grandfather’s work on movies like Ben Hur; series like Gunsmoke and as Jimmy Cagney’s stunt double.Acting became a way to deal with his feelings and gave him the strength to reinvent himself. Anton is known for his quiet intensity, complex presence and old soul charm. This has led to his being cast to play highly shaded characters.Biography by – Pat Troise",
