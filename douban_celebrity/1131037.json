He is the 1984 and 1988 Olympic silver medalist, 1987 World champion and eight-time (1981–88) Canadian national champion. At the 1988 Winter Olympics, the rivalry between Orser and American figure skater Brian Boitano, who were the two favorites to win the gold medal, captured media attention and was described as the \"Battle of the Brians\".Orser turned professional in 1988 and skated with Stars on Ice for almost 20 years. As a coach, he has led both Kim Yuna (2010) and Yuzuru Hanyu (2014) to Olympic gold. He also coached Javier Fernández to the 2015 and 2016 World titles. He is the skating director at the Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club.",
