    "introduction": "Jacqueline Audry (September 25, 1908 – June 22, 1977) was a French film director who began making films in post-World War II France and specialised in literary adaptations.She was the first commercially successful female director of post-war France.Audry directed The Pit of Loneliness (Olivia, 1951), based on Dorothy Bussy's 1950 semi-autobiographical novel, Olivia.[4] Set in an all-girls boarding school, The Pit of Loneliness depicts a lesbian love story between a schoolgirl and her headmistress.[6] At the time, the film was very controversial and was censored in the United States and the United Kingdom.[6] Edwige Feuillère was nominated for a BAFTA award for Best Foreign Actress for her part as Mlle. Julie, the headmistress.[7] The film has been called a \"landmark of lesbian representation\".[8] She frequently collaborated with her sister, the novelist and screenwriter Colette Audry.[9]Audry's film style was traditional and at odds with the French New Wave.[5] Her films had a feminist slant however.[5] Many of them had central female characters and they often gave a radical view of gender roles and female sexuality.[2][5][10] Audry died in a road accident in Poissy, Yvelines, France.",
