Oliver directed two TV episodes, the October 25, 1982 installment of M*A*S*H and the December 4, 1983 entry of one of its sequel series, Trapper John, M.D..[1]In Oliver's last fully active years, she also appeared in the February 21, 1985 episode of Magnum, P.I., two episodes of Murder, She Wrote (March 31 and December 1), the February 12, 1987 episode of Simon & Simon, and the January 10, 1988 episode of the NBC domestic drama Our House.
