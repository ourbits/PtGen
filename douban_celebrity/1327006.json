    "introduction": "English actor Max Fowler was born and raised in Strawberry Hill, South West London, to Karen and Simon Fowler, a Photographer in the music industry. Max is the youngest of 3 children; his sister Francesca is an Actress/Writer and brother Beau is a Writer/Director and Fight Choreographer. He went to Emmanuel High School in Clapham, London, but decided not to continue his further education and instead set out to pursue acting.At the age of 17, and without any formal acting training, Max attended open auditions for the TV show 'Skins', where he came second in the running for the role of Freddie out of thousands of hopefuls. From this success, his sister Fran's Agent at the time Eamonn Bedford decided to take him on for a probationary year, to see how he fared in the audition world, and with Eamonn's representation, Max quickly landed a role in BBC's 'Doctors' in 2008, followed by a lead role in the E4 short film 'Brink' (2009). Max then went on to play alongside Eliza Bennett and David Schofield in a lead role in the feature film 'F' (2010) ('The Expelled' in USA), which cemented his partnership with Eamonn.In 2012, Max guest starred in an episode of 'Waterloo Road' and 'The Hour', before landing a lead role in BBC mini-series 'Mayday' (2013), where he played troubled teen Linus opposite Aiden Gillen and Sophie Okonedo. After receiving acclaim for his role as Linus in 'Mayday', Max started to gain interest from Agents in Los Angeles and quickly added Agent Brinda Bhatt to his team, who set him up with numerous auditions for American movies and TV shows.In 2013, Max landed his first American role as a regular in season 3 of AMC's 'The Killing', which he got from a single self-tape audition. Here he played streetwise drug addict Twitch, and starred alongside a killer cast including Joel Kinnaman and Mireille Enos. For this role he moved to Vancouver, BC for 4 months, whilst also flying back and forth to Los Angeles for publicity shoots.",
