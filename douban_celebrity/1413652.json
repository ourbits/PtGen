    "introduction": "Jules went on to star in BBC One's medical drama series 'Holby City' as arrogant but capable Doctor Harry Tressler and soon became one of the hit show's most popular characters. The show regularly attracted over 5 million viewers per week and Jules quickly became an integral character, leading some gripping storylines. His leaving storyline caused a stir as Harry sustained major facial injuries, and the scale of prosthetics employed over a period of four episodes was a first, even for Holby. After two years, Jules left Holby and recorded his debut solo singing album with chart topping Producer Andrew Powell (Wuthering Heights) and Film and TV boss, Adrian Munsey. The album, 'Change of Heart' was released in April 20th 2015 and was recorded at Peter Gabriel's state of the art studio, 'Real World' with some of the world's finest musicians.",
