    "introduction": "In 2018, Prïncia Car founded an alternative film school in Marseille. Since then, she has been teaching through various workshops and evening classes in the city’s northern districts, with the aim of integrating art and cinema into the daily lives of young people often excluded from cultural opportunities due to economic or educational challenges. Following in the footsteps of the theatre troupe founded by her parents, she created her own troupe of young people, with whom she has made numerous award-winning short films and music videos.",
