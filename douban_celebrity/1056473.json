    "introduction": "\"BRAD ALLAN: Born with an inherent fascination of all things Chinese, Brad Allan started studying martial arts, boxing, gymnastics and Chinese circus arts from the age of 10 years. At age 15 years, Brad met two of China's greatest wushu athletes Liang Chang Xing and Tang Lai Wei of the renowned Beijing Wushu Team (the same team as Jet Li). Under their expert guidance Brad quickly rose to become one of Australia's top wushu athletes. At the age of 22 years Brad returned to Australia after several years studying language and martial arts in Asia. It was in his home town of Melbourne that he met his mentor and master, Jackie Chan. A chance encounter gave Brad an opportunity to demonstrate his skills to Jackie and his team; a dream come true that would change his life forever. As the first non-Asian member, Brad would spend the next 12 years traveling and performing around the world as part of the illustrious JACKIE CHAN STUNT TEAM. It was during this time and under Jackie's direct guidance that Brad would progress from stunt performer, to action choreographer, to stunt coordinator and finally action director. Brad Allan has travelled one of the more unique paths to Hollywood and brings a unique visual style that combines the best of the east and west. Action transcends language and cultural boundaries; It can excite us, move us and make us laugh. Brad Allan has a global vision for action film making. He works with an international team of skilled professionals from all over the world united by their passion for action and film making. His goal is to entertain, excite and motivate the human race.\"",
