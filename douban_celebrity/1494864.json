    "introduction": "Jack has several exciting credits to his name for a young actor; the most notable being the major role of Darcy in \"Kid Snow\" (dir. Paul Goldman) opposite Billy Howle and Phoebe Tonkin and Young Lars in \"Nine Perfect Strangers\" (dir. Jonathan Levine), for which he was able to learn from a remarkably star-studded international cast. His other credits include playing Young Clem in \"The Lost Flowers of Alice Hart\" (dir. Glendyn Ivin); the role of young Andrew Queller in \"Pieces of Her\" (dir. Minkie Spiro); the role of Young Rodney in \"Riot\" (dir. Jeffrey Walker); Jack in \"Little Monsters\" (dir. Abe Forsythe); and Young Boy in \"Diary of an Uber Driver\" (dir. Matthew Moore). Such high-profile credits have afforded him a great relationship with casting directors, directors, producers and fellow artists across the country and internationally. Jack has also appeared in many big-brand television commercials, including Fox Sports, Woolies, Banana Boat, Big W, Kids Cancer Project and P&O Cruises. Having started in the industry at a very young age, Jack has an excellent Standard American and English accent, and often receives work as a voice artist. He loves working alongside his little sister Lily, and spending time with his family, dog and just being a country beach kid, mixing his own music tracks on GarageBand, playing sport and devouring books.",
