    "introduction": "Horgan-Wallace's mother was Sophia Horgan, a fashion designer, and her father is Steve Wallace, a car dealer. They separated when she was three years old.[1] She was raised as a Jehovah's Witness by her mother in North London[2] and moved schools several times due to clashes with fellow pupils.[2] At the age of 16, Horgan-Wallace stopped living with her mother and stayed with friends before moving to a women's hostel.[2][3] She was reunited with her father at the age of 18 after he tracked her down.[4]It has been reported that Horgan-Wallace won a Prince's Trust grant to take a beauty therapy course at college, and that she had jobs in shoe shops and as a promotions girl.[2] Her official biography states that she studied at the London College of Fashion, and that she took part-time promotional jobs to help fund her education.Horgan-Wallace rose to become notable in the United Kingdom when she was selected as a contestant in the seventh series of the Channel 4 TV series, Big Brother, in 2006. She entered the Big Brother House on Day 12, and became known for her clashes with fellow contestants Nikki Grahame and Grace Adams-Short, and for being voted into the \"House Next Door\" by the public — a secret house, where she was forced to choose who, out of five new contestants, would become new housemates.[5][6][7][8][9][10] Horgan-Wallace reached the final on Day 93; she came third with 22% of the public vote.[11] She was the highest placed female housemate of the series.[12] It was reported that Horgan-Wallace's popularity shocked the show's producers, with tabloid sources suggesting that they had attempted to \"engineer\" the series' finalists, and did not expect the swing in public support for her.[13]In August 2010, she turned down an offer to appear in Ultimate Big Brother[14] in order to shoot her scenes as 'Maria' in the British urban comedy movie, Anuvahood instead.Since 2007, she has appeared in a number of episodes of Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe.",
