    "introduction": "In 2014 she graduated from the Boris Shchukin Theatre Institute, course of V. Ivanov.In 2015 she was admitted to the First Studio of the Vakhtangov Theater. Her debut on the Vakhtangov stage took place a year earlier. Polina played stats-lady in the children's play \"Cat in Boots\", staged by her teacher, Professor Vladimir Ivanov.Wide popularity came to her in 2015 after the role of Aksinya in the television movie of Sergey Ursulyak Quiet Flows the Don. As Polina said, she was preparing for the filming of Quiet Flows the Don for six months and tried to think through all the details to the smallest detail.Critics have rated her work differently, there have been many comparisons with Elina Bystritskaya - the performer of the role of Aksinya in the Quiet Flows the Don by Sergey Gerasimov. But in general, the actress coped with a difficult role - she created her own image of Aksinya Astakhova.In 2017, the historical film Furious was released, in which Polina played one of the main roles.",
