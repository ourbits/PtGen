    "introduction": "American martial artist Robert Samuels was a fan of martial arts and Hong Kong cinema, following in the footsteps of Jim Kelly & Ron Van Clief. Samuels got his first role on the movie The Gambling Ghost where he played a minor bad guy, but his knowledge of martial arts and enthusiasm made an impression on Sammo Hung who would later give him his biggest role in Don't Give A Damn, before introducing him to Yuen Wo-ping who hired him to play one of the terrorists trying to take over the cruise liner in The Red Wolf. Samuels would then appear as an extra in Teddy Robin's Hong Kong Grafitti, before leaving Hong Kong to break into the American industry.",
