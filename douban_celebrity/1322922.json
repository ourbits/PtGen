    "introduction": "Nicky Hamlyn is a British filmmaker, artist and published author working in Structural film. He has been making films for two decades. His work explores the basic elements of the filmic experience: the relationship between film space and the film frame, between time, flicker and movement, and between light and the material image. He contributes to journals such as Film Quarterly and has published Film Art Phenomena on structural/material film. He was workshop organizer for the London Film-Makers' Co-op in the late 1970s. He graduated in Fine Art from Reading University in 1976 and is currently a Professor at the University for the Creative Arts in Maidstone, lecturing in video Media Arts and Visual Theory. In his most recent work, produced on an artist's residency in Toronto, Nicky has been concerned with exploring and trying to refine the relationship between the camera and its profilmic. All the films are silent and have been made frame by frame, in the manner of animation, and include rural and urban landscapes and domestic interiors.",
