    "introduction": "Miida Chu is a Los Angeles-based writer-director. Her short film Eureka won the prestigious Golden Reel Award at the 38th Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival, which qualifies the film for award consideration for the Academy Award. As a screenwriter, she specializes in high concept queer romantic fantasy. Her feature script, Oblivion, was a semi-finalist at the Outfest Screenwriting Lab and a Quarter-finalist at the ScreenCraft Feature Competition. She was one of the seven cinematic arts finalists of the 2014 National YoungArts Competition. She served on the program committee of Miami Film Festival in 2020 and 2021. Miida holds a BA in philosophy from New York University and an MFA in film directing from the American Film Institute. She was accepted to UCLA's PhD program in philosophy, but we're glad she didn't fall into that parallel universe.",
