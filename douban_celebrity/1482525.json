    "introduction": "American director, cinematographer, and assistant director of silent films. A native of Chicago, Urson was the nephew of E.J. Hite of the Thanhauser Film Co. With his uncle's help, Urson was trained as a cameraman and eventually relocated to California as a camera operator for Fine Arts Productions. Director Marshall Neilan hired him as an assistant director, which led to work as cinematographer for James Cruze on several films. From 1920 on, Urson worked closely as an assistant director with Cecil B. DeMille on most of the latter's films, simultaneously directing his own for DeMille and others. Urson drowned while on a visit to Michigan, at 41.",
