He has made a number of acclaimed short films (including 'Just a Clown', and 'Swimming', which also were previously shown at Sundance) and co-wrote and performed the theme song for the WB Network television series Felicity (1998).Jarecki produced the documentary Catfish and has performed with the band Bikini Robot Army.Since the release of Capturing the Friedmans, Jarecki has been publicly advocating for Jesse Friedman, the son convicted of child molestation in 1988. In 2013, the Nassau County district attorney's office reviewed the case with an independent panel and upheld the conviction.He is a graduate of Princeton University where he was a theatrical director. He resides in New York City with his wife Nancy.",
