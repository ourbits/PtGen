    "introduction": "Ry Armstrong grew up singing with the Seattle Symphony and performed on the Grammy-nominated album \"The Shoe Bird.\" They have been seen in Off-Broadway productions of How the Westons Won, Pete the Cat, and Orphans & Outsiders. After finishing the National Tour of Teacher from the Black Lagoon, Armstrong released their charity album (Crossroads) that benefits Broadway Cares / Equity Fights Aids; available for purchase or stream with Broadway Records. The experience prompted Armstrong to start their own record label, Indie Chameleon, and produce new, original indie music. Along with being a singer-songwriter, they have appeared in both A24's Uncut Gems, HBO's The Plot Against America, and most recently HBO's The Gilded Age.",
