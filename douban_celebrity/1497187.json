    "introduction": "Marc was born in Marseille (France) on August 19, 1984. He began his acting career in Los Angeles where he took acting classes and masterclass to work on his craft, then he moved back to Paris where he continued learning acting with Cours Galabru in 2016. Marc benefited from his education (Corsican & Australian family) to learn different languages, such as French, English and Spanish. His first introduction into the Industry was in L'outsider (2016) thanks to Christophe Barratier. In fact, before becoming an actor, Marc had studied Market Finance in England (Durham). So when he met Christophe Barratier who was preparing a movie on the Jerome Kerviel case, they got along quite fine and that's how Marc was taken on board. After several appearances in TV films and short films, he obtained several roles in Cinema and Netflix shows : Le Bazar de la Charité (2019), Dix pour cent (2015). Marc is also taking part in international projects as in a feature short film Taro (2019), where he plays the role of Robert CAPA. In 2020, Marc was invited to the 77th Venice Film Festival to present The Man Who Sold His Skin (2020) by Kaouther Ben Hania.",
