    "introduction": "Overview (1)Height\t 5' 4\" (1.63 m)Mini Bio (1)Danielle Rose Russell was born on October 31, 1999 to parents Rosemary Rado, a former dancer and Rockette, and Walter Russell, a former singer. When she was ten, a friend of her mother's suggested to Rosemary that Danielle should pursue modeling. Her mother was hesitant at the idea, but sent pictures out online anyway. Not thinking anything would come out of it, Danielle received many calls from agents and managers asking for interviews. By age twelve, Danielle had booked several commercials and print jobs and had done a lot of regional theater. She eventually fell in love with film after her first movie, A Walk Among the Tombstones, opposite Liam Neeson and Dan Stevens. She can also be found in films such as Aloha, Pandemic, and Measure of a Man.",
