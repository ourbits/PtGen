    "introduction": "Tom Volf is a photographer and film maker. His work as a director spreads from filming for the Opera through fashion advertising and institutional documentaries for television broadcast and international communication, such as OECD. He has long collaborated with publishing houses to promote book releases, and with several shows for which he directed broadcasts and EPKs. As a photographer his interest gravitates towards vintage film photography, using legendary cameras such as Rolleiflex and Hasselblad. His photographs for fashion have been published in several magazines, and two exhibitions took place in Paris presenting his work from Tibet and the North Pole.Since 2013, he started a major project on Maria Callas, traveling the globe to uncover new material and lost archives. He has met about thirty of Callas’ closest friends and colleagues, with whom he filmed over 60 hours of interviews, and gathered a tremendous amount of previously unseen material. His film is due for release in 2017 in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of Callas’ passing.",
