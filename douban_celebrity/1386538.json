    "introduction": "Jacob Berger was born and raised in New York City. Jacob has always been a natural performer, taking part in plays and musicals through most of his childhood but then shifting gears to a more traditional line of work. After trying the 9 to 5 life, Jacob decided to enter into the professional TV/Film industry in 2010 after he began dabbling in the entertainment world and had a comedy rap video go viral. For the next few years, Jacob began putting in the work he needed to build his foundation in show business by taking classes at prestigious acting schools such as William Esper, Stella Adler, and UCB as well as learning the ropes of the business. By 2014, Jacob began getting major tv/film roles and working with award winning actors and directors. Jacob's career really began to take off in 2017 when he had several comedy sketches and parody rap videos go viral on social media which turned him into a social media influencer with today over 2.5 millions followers across his social media platforms, @jacobbergeractor. His social media success opened tremendous doors for his career. Jacob is a versatile character actor and entertainer who has shown proven success in both comedy and drama. Jacob is an authoritative type on camera but with a sense of vulnerability that is crucially needed for a layered performance.",
