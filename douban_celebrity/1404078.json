    "introduction": "This Texas-born beauty was raised in Orlando, Florida by her loving and supportive parents, Brian & Maria Blackmore. Jessica credits her mother for her fierce perseverance and thirst for knowledge, while she gained her imagination and athleticism from her father.Acting wasn't always on the forefront of her mind. Instead, she attended the University of Central Florida with a passion to pursue law. While in school, she was given the opportunity to work as a background actor in the film Sydney White. After 20 days on set, she became enamored with the industry, and shifted her future goals. Over the next couple of years in Florida, she would star in several student films before deciding to drive west. She and her husband packed up their entire lives, including their small Boston Terrier, and made the 5 day journey across the United States.  A decision that would shape the course of her future.Since living in Los Angeles, she has added over 100 commercials and several Indie films to her resume. Through her work, she has been able to travel the world, create different characters, and gain incredible life experiences.",
