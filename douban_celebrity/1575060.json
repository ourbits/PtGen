    "introduction": "Anne Charlotte Robertson is an American filmmaker born on March 27, 1949 in Columbus, Ohio, and died of cancer on September 15, 2012 in Framingham, Massachusetts. She is considered a pioneer of experimental cinema in the first person.Anne Charlotte Robertson grew up in a middle-class Protestant family. She studied film in Boston at the Massachusetts College of Arts where she is a student of the great American master of the Super 8 Saul Levine. She also chooses this medium which, at the time, was the most accessible. She is also influenced by filmmakers as different as Ed Pincus or Carolee Schneemann.Five Year Diary - A monumental self-portrait, a gigantic 36-hour corpus, divided into 85 reels with a duration of 26 minutes, Five Year Diary is the most important work of the filmmaker. Covering two decades, this chronicle of her daily life in Massachusetts is a vulnerable documentation of the filmmaker's struggle to survive her depression. Dark and intense interior monologues, tinged here and there with the humor and self-deprecation of the artist's consciousness of her illness, give this therapeutic experience in the cinema its fullest depth.
