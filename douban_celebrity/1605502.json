He had a grandfather who had appeared in several off-Broadway shows and instilled a passion for singing in his youngest grandson. At the age of five Adam taught his whole kindergarten class one of his grandfathers favorite old show tunes, \"Red Red Robin\", and they performed for the whole school; the seed was planted. Adam has a huge singing and stage background and began performing on stage in elementary school.Adam received his SAG card in 2005 while performing as Jimmy the tow truck driver who discovers a bomb on Law and Order \"Criminal Intent.\" He has been working steadily on prime time network shows mostly in New York City ever since. His biggest role to date is Ethan Rengepis in David Vincent Bob's biopic \"Right before your eyes\" for which he was nominated for best actor in the renowned International independent christian film & music festival in Orlando Florida in May of 2019.Adam and his wife Andrea and their son Carter are dedicated to their amazing loving and tight-knit family.",
