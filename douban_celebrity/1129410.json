RitaRita Pavone is also an actress.She starred in six movies during the 1960s;Although her movie career targeted a teen audience and lacked great artistic value, her movies have found today a cult niche.Pavone was also popular in the UK for a short while in 1966 and 1967. RCA Victor issued two of her singles in quick succession both were hits,\"Heart\"  and \"You Only You\"  , and in the UK Singles Chart.During this same period she appeared at the London Palladium.In 1968 Pavone married in Switzerland her talent scout and organizer of the first song contest she won, Teddy Reno.This event caused a scandal in the Italian society of the time because Reno was still married to his first wife, Livia Protti, and in Italy there was no divorce law until 1970. They re-married each other in Italy in 1971.Pavone recorded a total of thirteen albums. She mainly recorded for RCA until 1968, then she signed for a brief period with Ricordi which launched her vanity label, RitaLand, but eventually returned to the label that had launched her, recording three more albums with RCA.",
