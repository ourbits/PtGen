    "introduction": "Sir Michael Balcon was an English film producer, of Jewish heritage, known for his leadership of Ealing Studios from 1938 to 1955. He left after ownership had changed for a second time. Under his direction, it became the most notable British film studio. In an industry short of Hollywood-style moguls, Balcon emerges as a key figure, and an obdurately British one too, in his benevolent, somewhat headmasterly approach to the running of a creative organization. He is known for his leadership, as well as his guidance towards first time Director Alfred Hitchcock.Balcon had earlier co-founded Gainsborough Pictures with Victor Saville in 1923; later working with Gaumont British, which absorbed their studio. Later still he worked with MGM-British. In 1956 he founded a production company known as Ealing Films, and later headed British Lion Films. He served as chairman of the British Film Institute production board to help fund and encourage new work.Balcon was a legendary figure in the British Film Industry, and his most famous style of films he produced were 'Post War Comedies.' Balcon's work was also expanded beyond film, he was a writer of multiple books published from 1943 to 1969. Balcon was always described as a leader and inspiring.",
