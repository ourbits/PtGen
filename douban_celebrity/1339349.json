She was co-organiser of the Reheat Festival from 2007 to 2015 and co-organises the sporadic institut5haus exhibitions. Her films zounk!, darkroom and THE (co-directed by Dieter Kovačič) screened in the Berlinale Shorts competition. In 2022, she was accepted as a member of the Vienna Secession. Happy Doom was originally presented at the 2023 Berlinale. It is being rescreened as part of the “You and I Are Not Alone – Berlinale Shorts Revisited” programme in celebration of the festival’s 75th anniversary.",
