    "introduction": "Mary McGuckian (born 27 May 1963) is a film director, producer and screenwriter from Northern Ireland.Her interest in theatre and politics led her to follow an autodidactic post graduate education in literature, theatre, acting and directing on various courses in London, Paris and Italy.

The first of these to commence principal photography was her adaptation of the Thornton Wilder classic, The Bridge of San Luis Rey, delivered in May 2004, which shot in Spain.More lately, she has turned her interest and attention to the exploration of innovative film-making techniques aimed at integrating a more collaborative style of production in order to prioritize performance values with the aim of making contemporary drama more compelling to audiences.
