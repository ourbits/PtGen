Ruby Rich in her influential 1992 essay on the emergence of New Queer Cinema.[2] He then attended the Canadian Film Centre,[3] making the short film The Fairy Who Didn't Want to Be a Fairy Anymore (1992)[4] and the feature film House (1995)[5] while studying at that institution; he was also credited as the producer of John Greyson's CFC project The Making of Monsters.After his graduation from the CFC, he concentrated primarily on television directing,[3] including the television films Sibs and Open Heart, and episodes of Degrassi, Queer as Folk, I Was a Rat, Noah's Arc and Ghostly Encounters.Breakfast with Scot, his second feature film, was released in 2007. His subsequent television work has included Forensic Factor, Baxter, Murdoch Mysteries, Good Witch and The Adventures of Napkin Man.In 2010 he released the short film Verona, a preview segment of a planned feature film which recasts Romeo and Juliet as a romance between two gay university athletes from rival fraternities.[6] The feature project is now in development and tentatively slated for release in 2016.",
