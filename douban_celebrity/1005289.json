    "introduction": "Chris Jai Alex is from Lansing, Michigan. Chris was literally born into music. His mother, Gloria Sanford, was an aspiring artist since before his birth. With the exception of minor success and a star search appearance, she remained undiscovered. As the years passed she turned her attention over to her sons in hopes of realizing that ultimate dream nearly two generations old. Chris Jai showed promise, having a knack for creativity he taught himself piano, guitar, and midi music production. Later on, he produced and performed with a series of groups, the last and best being Mirage. Mirage had local success, they performed at local venues, one of which was with Boys II Men's, Wanya Morris. With Gloria's passing shortly before Mirage forming, she unfortunately never got to see or hear this group.",
