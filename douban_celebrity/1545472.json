    "introduction": "Nick Afoa is a New Zealand-Samoan baritone excited to return to the theatrical stage here in Opera Australia’s Miss Saigon. In his early years, he represented NZ in rugby, winning a Junior Rugby World cup title in South Africa. After an injury, he ventured into the performing world. His theatre debut was exactly 10 years ago in Sydney’s Capitol Theatre playing the role of Simba in The Lion King in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth. He was then cast in the role in London’s West End for five years. Since returning to NZ, he has cast and co-directed the original production of Pacifica the Musical, which premiered in Auckland 2022. He made his film/TV debut in a feature film Mysterious Ways, which will be released later this year.",
