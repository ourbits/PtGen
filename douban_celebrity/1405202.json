    "introduction": "Mother of Jacquel, wife of Dontey, an entrepreneur, singer, actress, and non-trained dancer that moves extremely well, Fuschia was born and raised in Baltimore, MD. While attending high school as an opera major at The Baltimore School for the Arts, she received a scholarship from The John's Hopkins Peabody Institute of Music to participate in an after-school program to study Jazz.Upon graduating from high school, she received several scholarships to attend The University of the Arts (formerly known as The Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts) to further her studies in Opera.Though Fuschia! really enjoyed opera, she agreed with her teachers that she had too much energy to stand still, and that her interpretive dance was not to be part of her recitals. Little did they know that dance was her first love. Early on in life she was told that she was too fat to dance. That did not stop Fuschia! She took that moment and discovered more. She was given her first opportunity to sing, act, and move extremely well ~ all at the same time ~ at Philadelphia's Riverfront Dinner Theatre production of \"\"The Wiz,\"\" playing the lead role of Dorothy, then as the Narrator in \"\"Joseph & The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.\"\" From there, it was non-stop to New York.",
