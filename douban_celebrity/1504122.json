Becoming someone else always seemed so much more exciting to him than reality. He knew that one day he wanted to become an actor.He attended the University of Toronto in their Theatre and Drama Studies program. While in university, due to his height, he was scouted for runway modeling and began working as a fashion model. During this time he was given his first acting break when he was cast in a music video for The Weeknd. He then finished his program and began pursuing acting professionally, making appearances in What We Do in the Shadows, Fear Thy Neighbor, Accused, and others.",
