    "introduction": "Gaia Scodellaro was born on July 15, 1985 in Naples, Italy. As a child, Gaia was heavily influenced by her mother‘s experiences as a professional dancer giving her the first glimpse of how one can captivate an audience, and the first insight into creating art through performance. After 10 years of absorbing Neapolitan cuisine, culture, and experiences her Italian Father and American mother moved with their daughter from Naples to New York. Being raised in two very dissimilar countries and two very distinct cities helped Gaia to gain diversity in her bilingualism and in her ability to envision the world from a variety of perspectives. This dual perspective also helped to fuel her passion for song and dance from an early age; with singing, piano and dance lessons throughout her childhood and early teenage years. Her dream of acting, however, was not realized until her years in Manhattanville College, where her shy and reserved personality was overcome by a newfound confidence in her craft.",
