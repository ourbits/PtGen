    "introduction": "Lawrence Gilligan was born in Oakland, CA on October 25,1983- son of Brian & Eva Gilligan. Lawrence is considered a \"Navy brat\" living in multiple cities and states throughout his child and adulthood. \"Due to my Dad being stationed in various locations growing up, it gave me the opportunity to meet new people and forced me at a young age to make friends quickly. Through that, I became someone who's able to relate to anybody.\" After his father retired from the Navy, Gilligan & his parents moved to Rio Rancho, NM. Gilligan graduated from UNM in 2007 and pursued broadcast journalism where he would eventually win a Emmy Award at WSOC-TV in Charlotte, NC. After being a journalist for 10+ years, he's able to pursue his true passion- being an Actor. \"The art is a passion of mine I've wanted to pursue since I was a little boy, and now I'm able to try and live out that dream. Even if I'm on screen for a brief moment, I'm blessed to work with wonderful people on set and create art I'm passionate about- even if it's short lived, the pursuit has always been worth it.\"",
