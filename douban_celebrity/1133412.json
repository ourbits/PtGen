    "introduction": "Character actor Sunshine Parker was born Lloyd Olen Parker on June 10, 1927 in Lawn, Texas. Sunshine served in the Army as a paratrooper photographer during World War II. Often cast in minor roles as either derelicts or amiable old geezers, Parker acted in his first TV show in 1969 and appeared in his first movie in 1979. Sunshine was especially memorable as the easygoing Emmet in Road House (1989) and the ill-fated Edgar in Tremors (1990). Outside of his film and television work, Parker was also part of the original MET Theater in Hollywood, California in the early 1980's. Sunshine died of pneumonia on February 17, 1999 at age 71 at St. Joseph's Hospital in Burbank, California. At the time of his death Parker was survived by two brothers and two sisters.",
