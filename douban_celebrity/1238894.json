In 2005, he originated his first Broadway leading role in All Shook Up earning him a Theatre World Award for \"Outstanding Broadway Debut\".In films, Jackson portrayed 9/11 victim and hero Mark Bingham in the 2006 Academy Award nominated United 93 which earned him the Boston Society of Film Critics 2006 award for \"Best Ensemble Cast\". He has also appeared in the films Curiosity and Hysteria. On television, he is a recurring series regular on NBC's 30 Rock, portraying Jack/Danny Baker. He also guest starred on several series including; Lipstick Jungle, Life on Mars, and Ugly Betty. In 2008, Jackson was cast as the series lead Sebastian Kinglare, and filmed the Lifetime Television pilot Family Practice opposite Anne Archer and Beau Bridges.[3] The series was not picked up for distribution.[4]Jackson has starred in several notable webisode series and in 2009 starred in a sold out one man show, \"Back to the Start.\"[4] In 2008, he was named Out magazine's Entertainer of the year.
