    "introduction": "Born in Australia in 1981, the filmmaker and artist has been based in the Netherlands since 2012. His focus on film developed out of video installations and from writing and designing for literary publications. He often makes comedies which depict alienated characters struggling with language, truth, time and history. Diverse experiences of language are a strong feature of his films. “Although his work may seem ironic at times,” one reviewer wrote, “it is characterised by a romanticism and razor-sharp lightness.”",
