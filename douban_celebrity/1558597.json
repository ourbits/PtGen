    "introduction": "Acting has been in Sharonne's blood since she was a little girl. In fourth grade, her teacher forced the entire class to learn Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech for an oratorical contest. Sharonne thought this idea was weird, but little did she know this would change the course of her life forever. She discovered she had a talent for performing in front of people. This talent would lead her down the road of acting and blossom into her undying passion. Sharonne Lanier studied Theatre Performance at the University of Central Florida graduating magna cum laude. While studying, doubts and thoughts of giving up began to cloud her dreams. On the verge of switching paths, her mother said to her, \"I believe God gives you dreams and visions for a reason. Don't run from it\". Since then, she hasn't looked back. Sharonne is a proud member of the Actor's Equity Association and has performed professionally in countless stage plays, television, and film productions. One of her proudest achievements was working as a company member at the AD Players under Jeannette Clift George where she learned and experienced the value of keeping God at the center of her aspirations. It is not Sharonne's goal to simply entertain, but she says, \"I am an actress who will use my God given talents to positively motivate people. I seek to participate in productions that aim to teach and enhance the joy and integrity of people's lives. I will leave this world knowing I contributed to making a number of people's lives easier to live.\"",
