    "introduction": "Marcel has been in front of the cameras since his home birth in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, and began his career acting in commercials since early age. He moved to Los Angeles at the age of nine and has taken his hobby of acting and turned it into a full-fledged career as a star in Netflix's reboot of One Day at a Time. Marcel's character Alex Alvarez mirrors his own laid-back and funny personality, but takes the second season to another level tackling topics like racism, popularity and bullying.With Award-Winning directors for parents, Carlitos Ruiz Ruiz and Mariem Pérez Riera, and a notable television host and comedian, Silverio Pérez, for a grandfather, Marcel has known the other side of the industry well from growing up on a set at his parents' own production company. A creative talent, Marcel enjoys filming and editing content for his YouTube channel, writing music, photography and fashion, and excels in athletics including basketball and soccer. His determined and philanthropic spirit has recently driven him to give back to his home island after Hurricane Maria through the campaign Voices for Puerto Rico.- IMDb Mini Biography By: Mariem Perez",
