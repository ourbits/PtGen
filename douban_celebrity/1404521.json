    "introduction": "Katriina Isberg was born in Toronto, Ontario with an Estonian background and speaks both English and Estonian. Her parents are Valve Leemet Isberg and Ulo Isberg, and her sister is Aleksandra Isberg.Acting was something Katriina dreamed about doing as a kid, but was talked out of by others who told her it was an \"unrealistic dream\". She kept it close by at the back of her mind, though, as she attended both Claude Watson School For The Arts and Earl Haig Secondary School in The Claude Watson Arts program as a dance major. Aside from majoring in dance, Katriina took part in various choirs, numerous art shows, a few school plays, and did a bit of modeling as well. She was also part of Team Canada for Group Aesthetic Rhythmic Gymnastics at Kalev Estienne from 2003-2008, competing around the world.",
