Born Francesco Prosperi in Rome, Italy, he began his career as an assistant director to Mario Bava, with whom he also wrote several screenplays. In 1966, he made his directorial debut, credited as Frank Shannon, with the thriller film Tecnica di un omicidio (1966), and over the years he built a solid reputation as a director of crime-action films. He also occasionally directed comedies and in the final stage of his career, at the beginning of the 1980s, several low-budget sword and sorcery films.",
