    "introduction": "Kyle Warren grew up on a rescue farm in rural Canada, surrounded by animals who needed a second chance. While playing college basketball in Colorado, a trip to the Sundance Film Festival-where he watched his friend, director Rebecca Thomas, premiere her film-inspired him to take a chance of his own. Feeling like he'd missed his shot at Juilliard, he created his own version-diving into voice, movement, on-camera work, and scene study with relentless focus. He began booking soon after, landing early roles on Supernatural and Bates Motel, followed by recurring parts in network dramas and a wide range of film work, including most recently A24's Eternity. Kyle now works across film and television, splitting time between Vancouver and Los Angeles, and is beginning to explore the stage as well.",
