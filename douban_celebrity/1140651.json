    "introduction": "Alfred Ryder (born Alfred Jacob Corn; January 5, 1916 – April 16, 1995) was an American film, radio and television actor, best known for appearing in over one hundred television shows, including the starring role as a British criminal who could not be killed in Alcoa Presents: One Step Beyond episode \"The Devil's Laughter'\" (1959). He appeared in the landmark first-aired episode (but not the first episode filmed in production order) of Star Trek on September 8, 1966. In \"The Man Trap,\" Ryder played Prof. Robert Crater, who is hiding the fact that the creature pretending to be the professor's wife, Nancy—as well as who appears to Dr. Leonard McCoy to be the same woman, but his long-past love who seemingly hasn't aged a day—is actually a shape-shifting, sodium-craving, murderous monster who will do anything to get salt. But, as Crater explains, it is also the last of its kind.",
