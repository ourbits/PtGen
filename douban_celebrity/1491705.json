On leaving, she formed a one-woman one cabaret act and toured on four continents,for thirty years, from Capetown to Las Vegas. As a guest artist on Peter Wreck's show she performed on the same bill as Peter Kraus and Stephane Grappelli.Settling in the US, she hosted a TV interview show, 'Tea with Liza Page', aired in Hollywood with an A-list of stars and celebrities like Alex Haley and Rene Victor.Impressed with extraordinary stories that apparently ordinary people present, she started a production company for people to be interviewed and record their life stories. This has seen Holocaust survivors, veterans of D-Day and women artists open up about aspects of their lives we might not normally hear about. Called 'Everyone Has A Story', the show makes the resulting interviews available online.In the late fifties she attempted a singing career and toured with The John Barry Seven.Her brother, Bert Page, was a bookmaker based in Brighton. He was also an amateur jockey, riding sister, Jill Day's horse Christella for a while. In 1959, with Denton de Gray as associate producer, Page formed Four Seasons Productions Ltd and spent £15,000 on a pilot film of Dick Turpin. The stars were Alan Browning as the celebrated highwayman and Jane Hylton who played Lady Elizabeth. With a script by Alan Reeve-Jones, it was directed by Max Varnel and the theme music was written by Frank Cordell. The film was never released.Sister of singer and TV star Jill Day.",
