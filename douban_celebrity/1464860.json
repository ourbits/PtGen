    "introduction": "Born and raised in Beirut, Lebanon, Karim Kassem mainly works between the US and Lebanon on films, music videos, and commercials. Karim’s artistic exploration first began in music, spinning techno for four years until his interest in photography was awakened by a college professor who invited him on a trip to Indonesia. Since moving to New York in 2012, he has made eight short films, and completed his first feature 'Only the Winds', which was selected for the 50th International Film Festival Rotterdam and Visions Du Reel 2021 in Switzerland. He is also finalizing work on a book about nomadic life in the city. Karim is an avid reader of metaphysics and reality is decidedly his métier. Whether through film or writing, he is constantly contemplating a hypothesis. An odd instinctive pull has at times manifested in synchronous ways during travel, as he has found himself arriving three days before the Egyptian revolution, three days before the Syrian Revolution, three days before Hurricane Sandy and exiting three days after the Lebanese revolution. Most recently, he landed in Beirut only a day before and survived the massive explosion that destroyed much of the city. This last experience inspired his upcoming feature film 'Octopus', which is currently in post-production.",
