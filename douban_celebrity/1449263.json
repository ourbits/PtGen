    "introduction": "Born in Seoul in 1987, Han Jay majored in screenwriting at Dankook University's Graduate School of Cinematic Contents. Since graduating, he has written and directed works focusing on bringing issues related to discriminatory treatment against targeted groups, especially LGBTQ+ individuals. When asked why he named a feature film of his \"Ivy,\" he commented, \"It means that one ivy leaf leads thousands of ivy leaves and crosses the wall. It is meant to hope that [the film's characters] will hold each other's hands like ivy leaves, and that people in similar situations will be able to find solidarity with each other. Even if a society that stands like a wall blocks them from the front, I hope that someday we will be able to cross that wall together.\" His films showcase the barriers from perspectives of societal norms/pressures and legal barriers created around those norms, and with it he \"hope(s) that the audience will cheer, saying, 'What is so different about their love?' and 'I hope they can be happy now.'\"",
