    "introduction": "Sir Peter Reginald Frederick Hall, CBE (22 November 1930 – 11 September 2017), was an English theatre, opera and film director. His obituary in The Times declared him \"the most important figure in British theatre for half a century\" and on his death, a Royal National Theatre statement declared that Hall's \"influence on the artistic life of Britain in the 20th century was unparalleled\".In 1955, Hall introduced London audiences to the work of Samuel Beckett with the UK premiere of Waiting for Godot. Hall founded the Royal Shakespeare Company (1960–68) and went on to build an international reputation in theatre, opera, film and television. He was director of the National Theatre (1973–88) and artistic director of Glyndebourne Festival Opera (1984–1990). He formed the Peter Hall Company (1998–2011) and became founding director of the Rose Theatre Kingston in 2003. Throughout his career, he was a tenacious champion of public funding for the arts.[1][2]",
