    "introduction": "Noboru Ando (安藤 昇 Andô Noboru, born 1926) is a Japanese film actor known for his yakuza roles. In fact, Ando was a real-life yakuza gang boss before becoming an actor in 1965, when he appeared in a film about himself, Chi to Okite (\"Blood and Rules\"). He later wrote, produced and starred in a series of films about his life and his former gang, the Ando-gumi. He also notably appeared in several films by Kinji Fukasaku.One clear sign of his past occupation is the large knife scar on his left cheek, the result of a brawl with a Korean gangster as a young man. According to Ando, acting came easily to him as a result of his underworld life: \"In Japanese, the only difference between yakuza and yakusha (actor) is one hiragana character,\" he was quoted in the Japan Times as saying. \"All yakuza have to be actors to survive.\"Credit to: Wikipedia",
