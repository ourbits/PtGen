    "introduction": "Damjan Kozole (born in 1964) is one of the most recognized Slovenian filmmakers. In his films “some of the most raffish, funky and even sordid characters discover their own humanity” (Alissa Simon, Variety). At 22 he shot his first dramatic picture The Fatal Telephone Call (1987), considered the first independent film shot in the former Yugoslavia. He has a number of documentaries, shorts, and features to his credit, many of which attained honors at international festivals. Sight & Sound ranked his SPARE PARTS (2003) among 10 most important films of the New Europe. After Berlinale Competition premiere, film won many awards on more than 50 festivals where it was screened. Released in more than 20 countries, it received one of the best reviews of the year from Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw who said “Kozole has given us one of the most powerful and provocative movies of the year”. LABOUR EQUALS FREEDOM (2005) premiered at Locarno IFF and was awarded Grand Prix and Best Director Award in Valencia. FOREVER (2008) premiered at Rotterdam IFF, while his latest feature SLOVENIAN GIRL (2009) opened in Sarajevo and Toronto IFF, hit more than 100 festivals after its Toronto premiere. Nightlife is Kozole’s ninth feature.",
