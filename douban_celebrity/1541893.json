After high school, he made up for lost time by studying art in San Francisco, logging thousands of miles and countless audio books as a cross-country trucker and earning a film MFA at Florida State.Next stop was Los Angeles, where he worked at ICM and Anonymous Content for a number of years before moving into writing and directing.",
