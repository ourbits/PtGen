After attending a casting for the movie When Hitler Stole the Pink Rabbit, she became without any previous acting experience other than a small role in the miniseries Family! , cast by director Caroline Link in the lead role. In the film adaptation of the novel about a Jewish girl who had to flee Germany with her family in 1933, she played the nine-year-old protagonist Anna Kemper. Krymalowski claims to attend the same school in Berlin that Judith Kerr, the author, once used the novel, was visited. Her work is part of the school reading there, says Krymalowski. “Actually only in the sixth grade. But my mom, who was also at school, gave me the book beforehand, and I love it very much. ” The film started in German cinemas at Christmas 2019.",
