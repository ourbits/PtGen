    "introduction": "Born in France but raised in Italy and Canada, Hervé Renoh is a multicultural, multilingual writer and director living between Paris, Montreal and Los Angeles. After shooting multiple short films, television series and commercials for French television, he wrote and directed the feature films \"Requiem\" and \"Coursier\".Produced by Fidélité Productions, the action thriller \"Requiem\" was shot in 29 days and cost less than 1 million dollars in spite of numerous sets and heavy action scenes. His second feature, the action comedy \"Coursier\", gave the writer/director access to a budget 10 times superior as it was produced by renowned French director Luc Besson's Europacorp studio, also producer of \"Taken\", \"Hitman\" and the \"Transporter\" franchise. Both films have been released in cinemas in France, then across the globe and \"Coursier\" landed Nº six at the Chinese national box office in June 2011.Hervé Renoh then went on to shoot \"Jack of Diamonds\" (\"Rouge Diamant\"), an English-language feature-length pilot episode for an international television series produced by Muse Entertainment (USA/Canada) Gaumont (France) and ZDF (Germany), that aired on Showcase, France2 and ZDF in 2011.",
