    "introduction": "Frank Wilson began his career as an actor and opera singer. He joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1900 playing many of the Principal Bass-Baritone roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan Operas. These were The Counsel in \"Trial by Jury\", the Notary in \"The Sorcerer\", Bill Bobstay or Corcoran in \"HMS Pinafore\", The Pirate King or Samuel in \"The Pirates of Penzance\", the Colonel in \"Patience\", Mountararat or Private Willis in \"Iolanthe\", Hildebrand or Arac in \"Princess Ida\", the eponymous role in \"The Mikado\", Meryll or Sir Richard in \"The Yeomen of the Guard\", Giuseppe in \"The Gondoliers\", and Mr Goldbury in \"Utopia, Ltd.\". He left the company in 1907, and by 1910 had started to carve a career for himself in film as an actor, writer, and director. He continued with his film career during a second stint with the D'Oyly Carte (between 1916 and 1911), and later reserved most of his creative energies for film only.",
