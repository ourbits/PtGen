    "introduction": "Joany got her start working for the documentary production company Florentine Films (known for Ken Burns) serving as associate producer on a couple of PBS documentaries, one about the history of tuberculosis in America and another about the history of the interstate highway system. Her job, pre internet, was to travel the country and do historical research and scout filming locations.Joany has optioned/sold over a dozen screenplays and has had nine movies made. Her first script, a slapstick comedy \"86 Management\" received sage advice from Bette Midler - lighten up on the Jimmy Buffet songs.\"The Christmas Card\" broke all time ratings records for the Hallmark Channel when it aired in 2006 (a record the movie held for nearly a decade.) The movie has been voted most beloved holiday movie of all time and received an Emmy nomination. The movie was filmed in Nevada City, California. Tourism increased so significantly because of the movie that Nevada City held an honorary event for her, dubbing May 19th Joany Kane day.Joany's \"A Christmas Kiss\" broke all time ratings records for ION and spawned two sequels.In 2013 Joany came up with an OTT idea inspired by her involvement with the romance novel community; a streaming service dedicated to turning romance novels into movies and series. She coined the name Passionflix, purchased the domain passionflix.com and spent the next couple of years trying to sell her idea of \"50 Shades/Twilight meets Netflix\" to Hollywood. In Feb 2016 she had lunch with Tosca Musk and Jina Panebianco to discuss movie projects and told them about her idea and a partnership was formed - the OTT launched in September 2017. Both Joany and Jina departed Passionflix summer of 2018. Passionflix was brought to life by the collaboration of three women and will forever have 3 co-founders.Joany continues to champion authors helping them get their content to the screen. She still writes Christmas but has now taken a shine to horror. She works to help Native American causes and organizations. She shares a cottage on a lake with the love of her life \"Logger Honey.\" She met Logger Honey (aka Dave) while working on the script \"The Christmas Card.\" If it weren't for Dave there wouldn't have been the movie that made it to the screen, and if it wasn't for \"The Christmas Card\" she never would have met Dave. (A romance worthy of a Hallmark movie.)",
