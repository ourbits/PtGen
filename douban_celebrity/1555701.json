In recent years, she worked on film and art projects in Georgia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovakia and Germany. Her short films were presented at Sarajevo IFF, Ji.hlava IDFF, One World Prague or CinéDOC Tbilisi. She studied narrative and experimental film at the Universität der Künste Berlin and worked as artistic director and curator of ACUD Galerie in Berlin. Her feature debut “Lapilli”(doc) had its world premiere at the 58th Karlovy Vary IFF in the Proxima Competition. Her second feature film “Action Item” (doc) is an entirely different, yet equally sensitive film, which will premiere at the 59th KVIFF and 36th FIDMarseille.",
