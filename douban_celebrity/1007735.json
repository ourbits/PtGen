    "introduction": "Peter Popzlatev, born in 1953 in Sofia and a former student of the Louis Lumière Institue, is one of the best known Bulgarian filmmakers. His career path reflects the difficulties of an art that was long held down by the Jivkov regime.In 1989, after several documentaries considered to be subversive and oftentimes censored - such as Un Choix Difficile and Le Père en Bronze - he was able to shoot, right before the fall of the communist regime, a first feature-length fiction film, Moi, la Comtesse, which won awards in Turin and in Angers. The heroine of the film, 18-year-old Sybilla, goes from wandering through the Sofia of 1968 to a psychiatric hospital's rehabilitation centre.Even though he was able to make Quelque Chose dans l'Air in 1993, it took Popzlatev ten years to make his next film, Même Dieu est Venu Nous Voir (2003), a dramatic comedy that brings up the Balkans' ethnic conflicts.",
