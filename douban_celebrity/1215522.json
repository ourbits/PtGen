    "introduction": "Dan was born in Toronto, the son of a computer software developer and a child care social policies worker. At young age developed an interest in comedy. At the age of five, he moved out west to the small town of Victoria, British Columbia, where his interest in comedy was peaked after acting in a 5th grade play. From then on, it's been a non-stop ride of joy, where Dan has explored many mediums, from stage and musical theater to film and television, and exploring many different genres. As he gets older, he hopes to move into other aspects of filmmaking.",
