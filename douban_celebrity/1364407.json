By age 8 he was story-boarding and shooting live action shorts with friends and stop motion Lego action videos using special effects.By the age of 9 he asked for help in getting on sets to learn directing. His father being in the industry was able to call around and during set visits friends found him to be so appealing they asked if they could write him into their projects. Aidan quickly found a love for acting as well.Within a few months he had booked two network pilots, a film starring Tyler Blackburn, and an episode of \"Modern Family.\"His first pilot, \"Jacked Up,\" starring Patrick Warburton, for CBS and Happy Madison Productions, was not picked up, but his second pilot, \"Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn\" for Nickelodeon quickly became the highest rated live action kids show in the world and ran for 4 seasons in the #1 position to a global audience of 900 million across 110 countries and 20 languages.The show won an Emmy Award, and Aidan was twice Nominated Favorite Male TV Star for the Kids Choice Awards. Aidan was asked to Host The Kids Choice Sports AwardsThe show was cancelled after a key actor left the show and within a month Aidan was cast in the starring role as \"Number 5\" for \"The Umbrella Academy\" on Netflix, produced by Universal Cable Productions and Darkhorse Comics.",
