After a short modelling career (she won the “Miss Evening Echo” competition in 1976) she performed briefly with the avantgarde punk band The Lemon Kittens and during this time she also contributed vocals to the League of Gentlemen’s 1981 eponymous album on the song “Minor Man”.After leaving The Lemon Kittens she embarked on a solo career, recording and producing the albums Pop-Eyes (1982), Jesus Egg That Wept (1984) and Inky Bloaters (1987) on her own label, Awesome Records.In 1988 she signed with Sire Records, which released Dark Adapted Eye which contained material from her first three albums as well as b-sides from the singles Big Hollow Man, Where The Flies Are and Yummer Yummer Man.In 1990 she released her lone major-label studio album, Blast the Human Flower. Her last two album releases were in 1995 and consisted of a career retrospective double-album entitled Comatose-Non-Reaction and the Timber Tongue EP. Dax’s career in the music business then went on indefinite hiatus, and was often referred to as a retirement.From 1996 on, she has worked in interior design, and has appeared several times on the BBC interior design show Homefront.",
