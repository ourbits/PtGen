    "introduction": "Griffin Gluck is among Hollywood's young actors to watch, who at the age of 16 already has nearly ten years of acting experience under his belt.Gluck caught the acting bug early when he went to a summer children's showcase of Guys and Dolls at the Palisades Playhouse. At the age of six, he landed a leading role as 'Nathan Detroit,' and discovered his love for performing.Since then, Gluck has acquired an impressive collection of credits in both film and TV and has worked with some of the most well-known names in entertainment. His big break came in 2011 when he was chosen for the role of Jennifer Aniston's son (and Adam Sandler's fake son) 'Michael' in Just Go With It, for which he also received a Young Artist Award nomination.Most recently Gluck was seen starring as 'Rafe Khatchadorian' in Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life, which also stars Lauren Graham and Rob Riggle. The film, based on the New York Times #1 bestselling book of the same name by James Patterson, chronicles the trials and triumphs of Rafe as he uses all of his wits to battle bullies, hormones and a tyrannical, test-obsessed principal.Gluck can also be seen in the upcoming holiday comedy Why Him from director and co-writer John Hamburg where he stars opposite Bryan Cranston and James Franco as 'Scotty Fleming,' the son of Cranston's character. The film is being released on December 23, 2016.Additional feature film credits include Baby, Baby, Baby, Just Before I Go directed by Courteney Cox, Larry Gaye: Renegade Male Flight Attendant, and Trust Me directed by Clark Gregg. Gluck also has an extensive background in television including roles as a series regular in Red Band Society, Back In The Game, and Private Practice; recurring roles in About A Boy, United States of Tara, and The Office; and a special guest appearance on HBO's Silicon Valley that recently went viral.",
