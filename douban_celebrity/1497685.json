    "introduction": "It was during his final year of training as an anesthesia resident in NYC that Jeff stumbled upon his first acting class.Little did he know at the time that, in the years to follow, he would be amassing awards and credits on critically acclaimed TV shows including Nurse Jackie, The Knick, and The Following, and acting opposite the likes of Edie Falco, Julianne Moore, and Kevin Bacon.Perhaps one of Jeff's greatest honors to date was to be selected to play the first Asian MIB Agent in the Men in Black franchise.Before the pandemic struck, Jeff was also developing momentum on stage as well which culminated in his performance of \"Quang\" in the lead role of Qui Nguyen's play \"Vietgone\" at American Stage Company in Florida which generated numerous positive reviews.And through it all, his most memorable career moments took place on the set of Blue Bloods where he impressed Donnie Wahlberg with his ability to convincingly play a dead person.",
