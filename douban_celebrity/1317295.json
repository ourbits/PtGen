    "introduction": "Shélan O'Keefe was born in Chicago where she lives with her parents, younger sister, Xenia, and no pets. Grace is Gone is her first feature film. In addition to acting, Shélan enjoys playing baseball & guitar, reading, knitting, drawing, collecting antique keys and random old photographs. She is a proud member of GirlsRock!Chicago, a summer camp committed to encouraging girls to be active participants in rock music. Through two summers with the camp, Shélan has formed rock bands, written songs and played at both Shuba's and The Metro in Chicago. One of her bands had the honor of opening for Nina Hagen at last year's EstroJam. She's trying to teach herself French and Greek and hopes to get a dog really, really, soon.",
