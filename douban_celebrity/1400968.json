    "introduction": "A Brooklyn transplant by way of his native China, Bing Wang is a documentary filmmaker known for capturing intimate human relationships and presenting enlightening cinematic moments to cultural outsiders. His self-produced and directed feature debut, “The Ability Exchange” (2016), acclaimed as “a one- man band empathy engine” by IndieWire, explores disability and inclusion in an intimate college classroom and beyond. \"Loud Love\", a tender probe into parenting and growth, epitomized by a gay deaf couple with hearing twin children in New York, is his second feature. Besides working on his own projects, Bing is also known for his editing and production skills which have been featured in an impressive portfolio of powerful films, including: \"9-Man\" (2015), \"Complicit\" (2017), \"The Naked Truth: China Queer\" (2017), \"People's Republic of Desire\" (2018), \"One Child Nation\" (2019), \"All in My Family\" (2019) and \"The Ugly Model\" (2019).Bing graduated from New York University with an M.A. in Cinema Studies from Tisch School of the Arts and an advanced certificate in Culture and Media from the Anthropology Department. He studied journalism and advertising at Fudan University in Shanghai for his undergraduate studies.",
