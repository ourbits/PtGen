    "introduction": "Joelle was born in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, England, in the Special Care Baby Unit extremely premature at 26 weeks. She is Austrian as well as English, having lived the majority of her life in London.Joelle grew up in an artistic household writing poems, songs and creating videos as a child. Having no hair since the age of 8 due to alopecia universalis, Joelle endured bullying at school and in public, which motivated her to want to change the way people view alopecia. By the time she was 13, Joelle became an internationally recognised alopecia awareness campaigner, after receiving an outpouring of praise from the public for her music performances and video creations.During her early teens, Joelle won several film festival awards, a pivotal time which led to her honing her skills, vocal training in Atlanta, Georgia with Peggy Still Johnson and further stage training with former director of the London Community Gospel Choir, Daniel Thomas. Following her success as an alopecia awareness campaigner, at 15 she became an ambassador for the UK charity Alopecia UK.Joelle went on to study film and TV in higher education and later directed and performed in her first short film Cover Up (2019), featuring original sound recordings composed by multi-Grammy-winning Oscar-nominated songwriter Diane Warren. Joelle made her feature film debut in Denis Villeneuve’s Dune (2021), plays the character ‘Joelle’ in Paul Feig’s Netflix film The School for Good and Evil (2022), ‘Joiya Byir’ in Amazon Studio’s second season of The Wheel of Time (2023), and the role of ‘Vipsania’ as a series regular in season two of MGM+ and Sky’s historical TV drama Domina (2023).Joelle’s performance style has been described as unforgettably genuine and unique.",
