    "introduction": "Angelina Maccarone is a German film director and writer.ContentsPersonal life\tEditAngelina Maccarone was born in Pulheim, Germany, 1965. A child of immigration, she is the daughter of an Italian father - who was also a guest worker - and a German mother who together moved to Germany in the 1960's.[1] Maccarone originally sought a career in music before turning to film. She played the electric guitar and became a lyricist when she was 14 years old.[2] In 1985, she attended the University of Hamburg and majored in German and American Studies.[3] Maccarone currently lives in Berlin with her partner, film editor Bettina Böhler.[4]Career\tEditMaccarone has been writing screenplays since 1992.[5] In that same year, she wrote a screenplay treatment that won the award of the Hamburg Department of Culture, which marked the beginning of her career in film-making.[6] In 1995, Maccarone wrote the final screenplay for a movie with the same name as the treatment, which turned out to be the coming-out comedy Kommt Mausi raus?! With this film, she made her directorial debut and was nominated for the Telestar award. She then made another film in 1998 titled Alles wird gut, which also won an award, as it was the winner of Audience Awards in multiple cities, such as Los Angeles and Toronto.[7] In 2005, Maccarone's feature-film Fremde Haut was released. It is about a gay Muslim woman fleeing from Iran to seek asylum in Germany, and it takes on topics regarding unclear and changing representations of identity as a lesbian Muslim woman.[8] Filmed during the New Queer Cinema movement, Fremde Haut is also noted for its few moments of briefly portraying a lesbian relationship as powerful and free.[9];[10] It proceeded to win the Jury Grand Prize at the International LGBT Festival in Montreal and the Jury Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Seattle L & G Film Festival.[7]The next year, Maccarone directed and released Verfolgt, which was finished in Hamburg.
