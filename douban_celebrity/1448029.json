    "introduction": "I've been doing martial arts since I was four years old. My dad was a huge Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan fan, so I grew up watching old school movies like Drunken Master and Enter the Dragon. I didn't love it when I was little because it was really tough, but eventually, when I got better and started competing, I loved it. Everyone you train with becomes your family and your team. It's really nice to have that support, and I think that's something that works with me: perseverance, determination, being part of a team and working together - just knowing there are people who have your back and you have theirs.I'd like to build enough credit to allow people to see me in a variety of different lights, not just action. Ten years ago, Asian women would generally only be action girls or stereotypes. It's getting better, but I want to help break those boundaries because there's so much more to women, of all different ethnicities, than just a stereotype.",
