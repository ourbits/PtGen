    "introduction": "Travis Burnett is best known as 'Claude' on the Disney+ series \"Diary of a Future President\" and as 'The Boy' on AMC's \"Dispatches from Elsewhere\" opposite Jason Segel.Travis got his first taste of performing when he would accompany his grandmother to rehearsals for the Nine O'Clock Players. One day the company's director suggested that young Travis, in a suit and top hat, get on stage and introduce that evening's cast to the audience. After listing every key player of the production from memorization, he garnered a standing ovation - to which he replied, \"That was fun...can I do it again?\" He was three years old.By the age of nine, he was performing regularly at Third Street Theatre and Glendale Community Theatre, and at ten he began training with Lisa Picotte and David Kauffman, who he still learns from today. By twelve, he was racking up television and commercial bookings.Travis' other television credits include \"Raven's Home\" (Disney), \"Solve\" (Snapchat), \"Bunk'd\" (Disney), and \"Team Kaylie\" (Netflix), and his commercial appearances include a national spot for AT&T. He will next appear alongside Michael C. Hall and Taylor Kitsch in the upcoming series \"Shadowplay.\"In 2019, Travis won a Young Entertainers Award for his performance in Newsies at La Mirada Theatre, for which he was also nominated for an Ovation Award. He has been awarded the National Youth Arts Award for his performance as the title lead in Oliver! and has taken home four Scenie Awards, including one for Youth Actor of the Year in 2019.When he's not busy on set or in class, Travis is a lego aficionado who loves riding horses and spending time with his cousins. He is also very passionate about helping the homeless, a cause that is both near and dear to his heart.Travis is represented by Nikki Mincks of Mincks Talent Management and Alicia Beekman & Laura Thede of DDO Artists Agency.",
