    "introduction": "Roberto Santucci was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He completed the Certificate Program at UCLA Extension in Film Video and TV in 1991 and and graduated from Columbia College of Hollywood with a BofA in Cinema in 1994. Since his early movies he showed a talent to communicate with the big audiences. In 1996 he shot his first feature film entitled \"Olé\". A dark off beat comedy produced with 30 thousand dollars out of a Volkswagen bus. The film was never accepted in any film competition nor pick up a distribution deal. In 2000 Santucci shot in Brazil \"Bellini and the Sphinx\", a detective story produced on a very tight budget with top Brazilian stars. The film won the $100.000 Public Award at the biggest film festival of Brazil, the Festival do Rio. After writing screenplays and trying to raise money for a couple of years, Roberto financed out of his pocket in 2005 his third feature film, a psychological thriller entitled \"Alucinados\". In 2008 the film won the best film award given by the public with the English title \"Riding High\" at the Los Angeles Brazilian Film Festival. Alucinados collected another 2 best film awards by an audience in that year. Unfortunately, it was never distributed. Tired of making films with little or no money, and no distribution, Santucci decided to make the most commercial genre of films in Brazil. He developed the high concept for a popular female comedy, \"Head over Hills\". For the first time Roberto did a picture with an adequate budget, a top producer in the business and top of the market distributors. The film became the Brazilian box office hit of 2011. In 2012 Roberto repeated the top box office with \"Till Luck does Us Apart\". In 2013 Roberto repeated the top box office with \"Head over Hills 2\".",
