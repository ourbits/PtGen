    "introduction": "Hugo Acevedo is an actor, writer and producer born in Texas and raised in Atlanta. Hugo was born into a Mexican American family and as a child he spoke only Spanish and taught himself to speak English by watching television. He joined the Marines out of school, and after that trained and fought as an amateur MMA fighter. It was during his MMA training that Hugo developed his drive and self discipline, which he found to be an excellent training ground for his true passion. Hugo knew from the moment he stepped into his first acting class that he had found his calling. Telling stories and connecting with others truly lit him up, and allowed him to express himself.",
