Paré studied drama at TheatreWorks, and appeared in over half a dozen amateur theatre productions as a teenager, including roles as Maid Marian in Robin Hood and Lucy in The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe.[4]In 2010, Paré began a role as Megan Calvet, Don Draper's second wife and Sterling Cooper Draper Price copywriter, on the television series Mad Men.[20] Paré's character had a prominent role in the Season 5 opener of Mad Men, in which she danced and sang a version of the 1960 Gillian Hills hit[21] \"Zou Bisou Bisou\".[22] Her recording of the song was subsequently released as a download and on vinyl.[23]In 2011, Paré appeared in '\"Beholder\", alongside Elaine Hendrix, Michael McMillian, and Rupak Ginn. The short film, directed by Nisha Ganatra, premiered as part of the ITVS/PBS series, FutureStates.[24] She starred in The Mountie, a western about the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, filmed in a remote location outside of Whitehorse, Yukon.[25] Paré also starred in the comedic short, \"Sorry, Rabbi\", directed by Mark Slutsky.",
