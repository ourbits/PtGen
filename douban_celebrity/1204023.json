    "introduction": "Born Ian Franz Anderson in Wakefield, Rhode Island, USA and raised in coastal Connecticut; as the youngest of three brothers (Christian, Damian and Ian) the arts were always a priority in their household.Movies quickly became Ian's first love. He adored the escapism of cinema and knew he had to get involved in the visual arts, so he went off to study film, first at Keene State, then at Emerson College where he met his love Capucine, who was studying television.After a whirlwind romance, they quickly married in NYC's Central Park in 1998 and moved to Los Angeles to pursue their entertainment careers. After a few years behind the scenes, working on shows like Party Of Five, All That, Scrubs, Sabrina The Teenage Witch.., Ian was given the opportunity to audition for a bit role on Sabrina - which he booked. Suddenly, Ian caught the acting bug, after having resisted the family business for so long (his brother Christian Anderson being an accomplished Broadway actor). There was something about screen acting that felt like the right fit.Now two children (Elliot and Oliver), a stint living in Belgium, two life saving open-heart surgeries, over twenty-five years married and about forty credits later, Ian finally feels comfortable enough to say he's an actor.",
