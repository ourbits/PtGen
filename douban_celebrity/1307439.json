His family background is extremely diverse, predominantly of Cuban and Eurasian - Greek descent. After studying Existential Phenomenology at the University of Dallas and receiving his degree, he moved onto Rice University to begin master's studies - however that was cut short when he discovered his love for stand up comedy. His first performance at the historic Laugh Stop in Houston Texas, where other comics such as Jaime Foxx and Sam Kinison got their starts, was all he needed to realize performance was what he wanted to do with his life.Following booking his first on camera role in the VH1 classic \"The MC Hammer Life Story\" as \"Mover\" Jason has performed in 60+ TV and film projects and in other capacities has worked in over 100 projects. Jason is a prolific writer with over 70 writing properties to his name. Most notably Jason has voiced for King of the Hill, Starfield and most recently Transformers One as the beloved Shockwave.
