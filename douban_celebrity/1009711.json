    "introduction": "Beginning with such characters as Freddy Krueger in A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge (1985) and Chucky in the \"Child's Play\" films, Kevin Yagher has established himself as one of the top make-up effects artists by developing and creating life-like creatures, aliens, animals and humans with meticulous detail. His company, Kevin Yagher Productions Inc. (KYPI), has created effects for such high-profile projects as Paramount Pictures thriller Face/Off (1997), Enemy of the State (1998) Volcano (1997), Starship Troopers (1997), and Conspiracy Theory (1997). KYPI's creations have also graced the screen in a variety of genres from Columbia Pictures' Radio Flyer (1992) to Paramount Pictures' action-adventure Mission: Impossible II (2000) to Walt Disney's comedy Honey I Blew Up the Kid (1992). Yagher has further expanded his creative efforts by directing. For the HBO series Tales from the Crypt (1989), he directed all of the show's wraparounds and several promotional spots, one of which earned him an Emmy in 1992. He also helmed two episodes for this cable series, (HBO's Tales from the Crypt (1989)) receiving a Cable Ace nomination in the process.",
