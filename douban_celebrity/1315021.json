He was surprised when Bidgood asked him to model and ultimately cast him to star in his film, Pink Narcissus, as he had never considered himself to be attractive. The name Bobby Kendall is a pseudonym Bidgood suggested.Bobby and his mentor, James Bidgood, lived together for a few years, and remain friends. Both still live and reside in New York City.
