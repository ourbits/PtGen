    "introduction": "Actress-comedienne Bea Arthur was born on May 13, 1922 in New York City to a Jewish family. She grew up in Maryland where her parents ran a dress shop. By the time she was 12 years old, she grew to be 5'9\" and was the tallest girl in her school. She earned the title \"wittiest\" girl in her school, but Bea's family was not in show-business and she did not think her family would support her dream. She then worked as a laboratory technician, drove a truck and worked as a typist in the Marine Corps. She also had a brief first marriage, which ended in divorce. Afterwards she told her parents she really wanted to pursue a career in show business, and they supported her decision to join the New York's Dramatic Workshop for the New School for Social Research. She played classical and dramatic roles, and it would take years before she found her niche in comedy. Her breakthrough came on stage while appearing in the musical play \"The Threepenny Opera\" with Lotte Lenya. She was also a regular on television on Sid Caesar's show Caesar's Hour (1954) for one season in the 1950s. Then in 1964 she truly became famous when she appeared in the original Broadway production of \"Fiddler on the Roof\" as Yente the Matchmaker. In this supporting role she stole the show night after night.",
