    "introduction": "Concept Designer of the Cities of Love (TM) feature film franchise. He has started an extensive copyright and trademark registration process to protect the Cities of Love (TM) franchise and take to a global level on-line. The first licenses were sold in 2009: \"Rio, Eu Te Amo\" and \"Jerusalem, I Love You\".Did not attend the 2006 Cannes Film Festival opening of 'Paris, je t'aime' in solidarity with two directors whose segment had been cut by his co-Producer Claudie Ossard. Went to eat at MacDonald's instead.Strictly defended a non-smoking regulation in his Production office until the day Jean-Luc Godard showed up with a big cigar.He collaborated for a few months with Anthony Minghella on his Segment in \"New York, I Love You\" until he had to go through surgery and quit the project. With Anthony's approval, his Segment was taken over by Shekhar Kapur. He quoted Anthony Minghella saying: \"I remember meeting with Shekhar a couple of times and having long conversations with him. We disagreed pretty much about everything. He would be a great choice.\"During the 5 years development period of \"Paris, je t'aime\", Benbihy was calling the Coen Brothers once a year to check if they would be available, until they said \"Why not?\".Back in 1996, Benbihy was convinced that the future of the film industry was in Asia. He decided to make movies and produce Asian films. As Cities of Love (TM) took off, he postponed his Asian commitments until he moved to China to produce \"Shanghai, I Love You\". All his productions are now originated from Shanghai.",
