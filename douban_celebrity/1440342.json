    "introduction": "Brandon is a multi-ethnic (African-American, Native American (Chippewa), Latin, French, Italian, Polish and German) actor living and working on the East Coast. He's been in the biz for over 20 years working on stage and screen. He originated roles in the Theater for playwrights including Lee Blessing (Black Sheep) and Christopher-Demos Brown (When the Sun Shone Brighter). On screen he's normally known for playing no-nonsense figures of authority but behind the scenes he's anything but. Grateful to be here and grateful to be able to do something he loves and work with people at the top of their game. On Instagram @OGBrandonMorris",
