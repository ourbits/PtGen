    "introduction": "Herman Bing was born in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany and died in Los Angeles, California. He was production chief of films in Germany before he went to America with director F. W. Murnau. As well as acting in over 120 films, he was also in Burlesque. He also provided the voice for the Ringmaster in Walt Disney's Dumbo, and Von Hamburger in \"Daffy Duck in Hollywood\" (1938). Many of Bing's parts were uncredited.The type of comedy he was known for became outdated in the years following World War II. It was said he was a known Nazi sympathizer which damaged his career when the United States entered World War II. He became increasingly depressed in the mid-1940s, as he was unable to secure work in Hollywood, and committed suicide in 1947 by shooting himself.",
