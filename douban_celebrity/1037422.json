    "introduction": "Charles Hamilton Eglee grew up in North Haven, Connecticut and Eastham, Massachusetts. He was graduated cum laude from Williston Academy and received his B.A. in English from Yale University. After a brief stint teaching film history at Yale, Eglee moved to California and worked for Roger Corman, where he served in a variety of production capacities and met then production designer James Cameron. With Cameron, Eglee wrote Piranha II: The Spawning under the screen name H.A. Milton. Subsequently, he wrote and produced the canuxploitation classic, Deadly Eyes. In 1984, Eglee moved to television, joining the writing staff of St. Elsewhere as a story editor for two seasons. He went on to become writer and supervising producer of the ABC series Moonlighting. At 20th Century Fox Television, Eglee co-wrote and executive produced the one-hour pilot, Rockenwagner. Joining Steven Bochco Productions in 1991, Eglee wrote and co-executive produced the ABC series Civil Wars, during which time he also wrote for L.A. Law. In 1993, he co-created and executive-produced the short-lived ABC series, The Byrds of Paradise, starring Timothy Busfield, Seth Green and Jennifer Love Hewitt. At the show's conclusion, Eglee joined NYPD Blue during its second season, as writer and co-executive producer. In 1995, he co-created Murder One with Steven Bochco and was the show's executive producer and show runner. Again with Bochco, Eglee co-created and executive-produced Total Security for ABC starring James Belushi and James Remar. Eglee and James Cameron teamed up again in 2000 to co-create Dark Angel, a futuristic dystopian drama starring Jessica Alba. In 2003, Eglee joined the writing staff of the groundbreaking FX police drama, The Shield as executive producer. In 2007, Eglee joined the Showtime drama series Dexter as head writer and executive producer for the show's third and fourth seasons - both of which received the Emmy nomination for Best Dramatic Series.",
