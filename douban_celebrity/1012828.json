    "introduction": "Gustav Ucicky, (born July 6, 1899, Vienna, Austria—died April 26, 1961, Hamburg, West Germany), Austrian film director known for historical and nationalistic German films done during Adolf Hitler’s rise to power.Ucicky began his career as a cameraman with director Michael Curtiz. He moved to Germany in 1928 and became involved in the state-subsidized studio UFA. His early movies, such as Hocuspocus (1929) and Der unsterbliche Lump (1930; Immortal Vagabond), were light and well-directed entertainments that were praised for artistic photography.Ucicky’s first nationalistic film, Yorck (1931), was panned in the United States as being no more than an overglorified depiction of an episode of German history. Though similarly criticized in Austria, the movie launched a string of films that were approved for the German public by Joseph Goebbels, Nazi minister of propaganda. Morgenrot (1932; Dawn), which gained some recognition both in Europe and the United States, is a realistic story of U-boat warfare and depicts the dangerous and tenuous life in a submarine. Flüchtlinge (1933; “Refugees”) was crudely anti-Soviet and was followed by several other propaganda films. After the war, Ucicky resumed directing—though his final six films, made between 1944 and 1958, are generally regarded as unremarkable.",
