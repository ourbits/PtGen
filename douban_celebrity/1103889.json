    "introduction": "Joseph Lanza was born in Thompsonville, Connecticut on April 20, 1923. One of a dozen children, Joey had the advantage of a great deal of freedom. He returned to complete his senior year in high school after serving in the Air Force during World War II, and graduated from UCLA seventeen years later at the age of 39 (June 1962). Joey's job resume lists over seventy different occupations, from shining shoes to stage and film choreographer. This vast area of job experiences fortunately turned out to provide him with an endless supply of material for his first love, writing. Joe owned and operated \"The Hollywood Dance Club\" for ten years, danced in some 75 films and television shows, created the Bossa Nova dance, along with several novelty dances. Winner of the Rudolf Valentino Tango trophy in 1952, he has taught in public high schools, written over 30 books, from his 1964 \"Art of Teaching Ballroom Dancing\" to his current \"Strictly Swing The Dean Collins Way.\" Lanza taught from 1949 through 1962 in Hollywood.",
