    "introduction": "As an explorer of landscapes and cities, Bassetti, who was born in Milan, Italy in 1961, has always been concerned with the identity and memory of places. Among other things, he founded and curated the Neapolis Rock Festival on a former industrial site near Bagnoli, Naples. His storytelling project “Sacro Gra” provided the idea for the documentary of the same name by Gianfranco Rosi, which won the Golden Lion at the Venice International Film Festival in 2013. In 2018, Bassetti made his directorial debut with the documentary Magnifiche sorti – Quadri da una esposizione universale.",
