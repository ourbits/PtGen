    "introduction": "http://lauraclifton.com/Laura's interest in acting came at the age of eight when she was cast in a hotel commercial overseas — and since, she's portrayed Susana Dickinson and played roles from Tennesee Williams to Anton Chekhov. More recently, she's been best known for her film and television work in \"My Generation\" (ABC Studios), \"Happy Death Day\" and \"Happy Death Day 2 U\" (Blumhouse Productions, Universal), \"Alamo\" (Touchstone Pictures) as well as \"The King\" among others.As a child, she was raised in Saudi Arabia while her father worked for Aramco Oil in their computer science division. During that time, she attended an international school and traveled the world on holidays (Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Egypt, Switzerland) and when her father spent extended periods of time on assignment outside of the Kingdom (Holland). Conversational in French and capable in Arabic and Korean, she did not attend a school in the USA until junior high.After spending most of her teenage and young adult years in front of the camera, Mrs. Clifton is beginning to explore the world from the other side, in back of the camera. Stay tuned for what's in store for 2020!",
