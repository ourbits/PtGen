Having transferred from a theater arts school to a public one, she began to get bullied by girls who called her \"theater freak\" and \"nerd.\"[6] They told her she would never become successful or a star,[3] and one girl threatened to beat her up.[7] She also received harsh text messages and her only friend began to ignore her. Because of the bullying, she began skipping school events, like pep rallies,[8] and didn't walk at her graduation.[7] She graduated from Wheeler High School in 2004.[3] She is an alumnus of AMDA, a performing arts college.Tobin's first performance was at age four as a Christmas tree in her school's holiday pageant.[10] She moved to New York when she was eighteen to get working right away.[1] She has worked on Broadway as an understudy and replacement for the musical Rock of Ages. She's done other small theater projects, though most of them were as an understudy, and toured with the Trans-Siberian Orchestra in 2011.She plays Kitty Wilde in the Fox television show Glee.
