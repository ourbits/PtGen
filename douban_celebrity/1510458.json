He has been known to thrive in war torn third world countries, act as a voice for the voiceless as an animal philanthropist, having founded the oil spill response group, 'Defenders of the Coast,' and co-founding the coveted venue EIFFEL SOCIETY, with a core belief in sustainability, community, and transformation. Roger's other philanthropic efforts had led him to Barlad, Romania where he worked in an orphanage and with Global Volunteers teaching English in rural parts of Greece.Roger Ivens' first Hollywood appearance was in 'Defenders of the Coast', a reality TV show/pilot that followed his efforts in response to the BP oil spill cleanup, but it was his role as SWAT Commander in BET's 'Sacrifice' that launched Roger Ivens as an actor.Since then, Roger Ivens has appeared in a handful of films and TV series, including #Freeyrayshawn, Lonesome Soldier, Finding Lily, VR and Unbelievable but he is mostly known for his work as the sensational 'Helicopter Sniper' In STRANGER THINGS S4 EP8.When not practicing his craft of acting, you can find Roger Ivens exploring the mountain ranges by his new home in New Mexico, kicking back with his Rugby buddies from the glory days or kicking down doors and clearing rooms in a kill house honing his 'other' crafts.",
