    "introduction": "Akram Zaatari, born in 1966 in Saida, Lebanon and based in Beirut, has produced films and videos, all sharing an interest in writing histories and practices related to excavation, political resistance, the lives of former militants, the legacy of an exhausted left, the circulation of images in times of war. Zaatari has played a critical role in developing the formal, intellectual, and institutional infrastructure of Beirut’s contemporary art scene. As a co-founder of the Arab Image Foundation, he has made invaluable and uncompromising contributions to the wider discourse on preservation and archival practice. Zaatari represented Lebanon at the Venice Biennial in 2013 with his film Letter to a Refusing Pilot. His works have been shown all over the world in solo and group exhibitions.",
