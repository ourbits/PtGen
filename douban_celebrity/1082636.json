    "introduction": "He was born into show business in 1947, son of the late Los Angeles television and radio personality Larry Finley and cousin to late writer/producer Rod Serling. One would think that at the age of sixty-two, Finley would be content being a top Hollywood theatrical voice-over artist who has worked on over two thousand, five hundred movies and TV programs over the years. But now, Greg wants to get back in front of the camera and continue what had once been a successful \"on-camera\" career back in the early 1980s.After graduating from Beverly Hills High School, Finley went into the Army where he rose to the rank of Captain and spent eighteen months in Vietnam in Special Forces. After his military service, he married a widow with four daughters and settled into his life supporting the family by selling automobiles in northern California. Two years later, his son Guy was born. After his marriage dissolved, he moved back to the Southland to pursue his dreams of becoming an actor.Successful as a day player in the late '70s and early '80s, Finley's writing and voice-over career began in 1981 as a writer/director on the syndicated animated television series, \"Robotech.\" He remarried in 1982, and in 1983, about the time his voice-over career blossomed, another son, Garrett, was born. Over the following twenty-five years, he has written literally hundreds of news reports, sports broadcasts, and weather spots for group ADR, and has performed them in a couple of thousand TV shows and Films.Starting a \"new\" career in his early sixties? \"I've kept my acting chops strong working on the ADR/looping stage, and by working in Community Theater over the years,\" says Greg. Active as a past board member and President with his local CommunityTheater, still in love after twenty-seven years of marriage to his wife Patti, still close to all of his children, and still happily working as a voice-over actor, Greg Finley is acting and directing on stage, and looking forward to hearing those words he never hears on an ADR stage, \"Roll camera, marker, speed, and action!\"",
