    "introduction": "Still only 23 years of age, reality television alumni AYDAN has already had appearances on many iconic Australian TV shows including Young Talent Time, Eurovision Australia Decides and Australia's Got Talent having kicked started his television career at the ripe old age of 10 - but it was AYDAN's impressive performances on The Voice in 2018 that had the coaches marvelling at his voice and performance skills. AYDAN won over judges and fans from the start of the season with electric performances week after week - delivering flawless vocals and tight dance routines which received a huge response from young fans across the country. AYDAN was a member of Team Jonas and Joe continues to be a mentor and supporter of his career, describing him as \"my little pop star\", and offering to write songs and collaborate with him on future projects. AYDAN has developed a dedicated social media fan base which continues to grow strongly. With just under 200,000 followers on Youtube, 130,000 followers on Instagram, 65,000 followers on Tiktok and 10,000 followers on Spotify - Aydan is a social media force, and has a string on brand credits including 'McDonalds' on his resume. In 2019 AYDAN performed his original song \"Dust\" on the SBS series, \"Eurovision, Australia Decides\", alongside established Australian acts including Sheppard and Kate Miller-Heidke. His first live tour was a huge success with meet and greet tickets selling out in just minutes and sold out shows across the country. AYDAN produced a high energy fully choreographed live show which received rave reviews and went out on the road for a second time later in the year. AYDAN is currently signed to Island Records, Specific Music and Universal Music Publishing. Since this signing, AYDAN has focused much of his time to penning songs with some of the best songwriting teams in the US and Australia and collaborating with top talent such as DJ Tiger Lilly. Aydan is not only a gifted performer, but a prolific songwriter too with a strong passion for writing authentic pop hits. In 2020 AYDAN appeared in his first professional musical, 'Fangirls', where he played Harry, a young pop star with a myriad of energetic fans. With sold out crowds, and fans travelling interstate just to see him in this hilarious musical, AYDAN has won more hearts around the country. He joined the cast of 'Fangirls' once again in 2021 after popular demand. \"[Fangirls] Draws you in until you're sharing every roller coaster emotional moment\" - THE AUSTRALIAN",
