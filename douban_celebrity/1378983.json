    "introduction": "Hunan born Huang Man got her debut at the age of 10 as a child actress during the post World War II reconstruction heyday of the Shanghai film industry and migrated to Hong Kong in the early 1950s after further civil conflict erupted between Communist & Nationalist bloc forces. Starting out with independent productions including a stint with the Kaomintang backed Central Motion Pictures Corporation in Taiwan and later signing with Hong Kong's Shaw Brothers in the early 60s, Huang Man's career growth paralleled that of the Hong Kong & Taiwan film industries in general since its inception with the versatile talent to have garnered credits in both Mandarin & Cantonese dialect motion pictures right through the Cantonese dominated Hong Kong New Wave of the 80-90s as well as being a veteran staple of HK television with TVB since the 1980s.",
