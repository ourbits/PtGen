    "introduction": "Bridget Kim is a Korean-American actress from Eastern Kentucky. Proudly identifying as Appal-Asian, she spends much of her life figuring out how kimchi and grits can exist in the same dish. Bridget recently earned her MFA in Acting at Case Western Reserve University/Cleveland Play House. Before that, she was at the University of Louisville where she graduated with a BA in Political Science and a Minor in Theatre Arts. Her most recent roles include Kitty in The Three Musketeers (Cleveland Play House), Ismene in Antigone (Cleveland Play House), and Ginny Yang in Smart People (Liminal Playhouse). Bridget decided to become an actress after watching Josh Hutcherson (also a Kentucky boy!) in Bridge to Terabithia, the first movie to make her cry. Coincidentally, her goal as a performer now is to make ten-year-olds cry when she appears on the screen.",
