    "introduction": "Evan Handler is an actor, author, screenwriter, and journalist best known as one of the stars of HBO’s SEX AND THE CITY, as well as Showtime’s current hit CALIFORNICATION. Evan is the author of two books. TIME ON FIRE: MY COMEDY OF TERRORS is his critically acclaimed debut memoir detailing his unlikely recovery from acute leukemia (and his escape from the clutches of those supposedly devoted to its treatment). His second book, IT’S ONLY TEMPORARY: THE GOOD NEWS AND THE BAD NEWS OF BEING ALIVE, describes the years since the illness, and his attempts to find meaning within his unlikely existence. Mostly, though, he finds absurd relationships, twenty-seven break ups (involving only ten women), a severe depression, eventual love and happiness, and fascination on the parts of Italians with American anal hygiene. The book was published by Riverhead in May of 2008.    FM:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/evan-handlerEvan first came to prominence as an actor by playing leading roles in seven Broadway productions before his thirtieth birthday, including “Six Degrees of Separation”; “I Hate Hamlet”; “Brighton Beach Memoirs”; “Broadway Bound”; and “Master Harold...and the boys” – all in spite of losing the years from 24 to 28 to his battle with leukemia. Evan has appeared in leading roles in the feature films RANSOM, TAPS, SWEET LORRAINE, and NATURAL BORN KILLERS, played Stooge Larry Fine in the television movie THE THREE STOOGES, and has made memorable guest appearances on LOST, SHARK, THE WEST WING, SIX FEET UNDER, and FRIENDS",
