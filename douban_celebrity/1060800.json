    "introduction": "No-one is exactly sure what gave Animal Man his powers - the ability to mimic the natural abilities of nearby animals for a limited period of time - but he has put them to good use. In his life as a stuntman they could have come in quite useful, but he chose to use them first as a traditional hero, and sometimes member of the Justice League, and later as a crusader for animal rights and other environmental issues. He has a close connection to the animal life of this planet, which can sometimes prove more useful than his flashier powers. He has a family, who generally support him in his heroic actions - his wife Ellen is fairly fond of the Martian Manhunter.",
