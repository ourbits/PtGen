    "introduction": "Jill \"Sixx\" Gevargizian is a director and producer from Kansas City, Missouri. Much like the protagonist in her new film The Stylist (2016), she has been a hairstylist for over 10 years. As a child, Gevargizian picked up her dad's camcorder, and the rest is history! In 2012, she decided to bring independent horror films to her hometown by creating a monthly showcase called Slaughter Movie House - that she is still running today. Gevargizian has worked on many films outside of her own. She was the second-unit director for Jen & Sylvia Soska's ABCs of Death 2 (2015) segment, and recently assistant director on James Bickert's 35MM feature Frankenstein Created Bikers (2016). Her directorial debut, a short entitled Call Girl (2014), starred genre-favorites Laurence Harvey (The Human Centipede II & III) and Tristan Risk (The Editor, American Mary), and her micro-short Grammy (2015) was distributed by CryptTV. The Stylist (2016), starring Najarra Townsend (Contracted), sliced through the competition, screening at the best genre film festivals across the globe and winning 17 awards, including the Jury Award at Etheria Film Night and Best Performance in a Short (Najarra Townsend) at Fantastic Fest and Monster Fest.",
