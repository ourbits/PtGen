    "introduction": "The son of an Irish father and a Russian American mother, Ronan spent much of his early life moving around the world, following his fathers work and his changing family situation. By the time he was three, he had lived in New York, California, Greece, The Republic of Ireland and the UK. After his parents divorce at the age of three, Ronan moved to New York with his mother, where he began his elementary school education. Through out this time Ronan spent most of his school holidays with his father back in Ireland, who was eager that Ronan hold on to his roots there. When Ronan Reached his early teens the situation was reversed, and he began going to school in Ireland and returning to the USA for his holidays. This bi-continental upbringing has given him a unique insight into both American and European ways of life, and has proved invaluable at various stages of his professional career. After school, Ronan was accepted in to the acting degree course at the prestigious Royal Welsh College Of Music And Drama, where he received a 2:1 and graduated in 2004. Next, He moved to London, where he has since worked consistently in the many varied aspects of the acting world, from Television to Feature Films, Shorts to Voice Overs, Performance Capture to Commercials, and both small and large scale theatre. His job has taken him all over the world, and the dual citizenship given to him by his mixed parentage has proved to be one of his greatest assets.",
