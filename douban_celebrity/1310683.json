    "introduction": "Landon Liboiron is from the small farming community of Jenner, Alberta, about two and a half hours southeast of Calgary, Canada. When he was in grade nine, there were 21 students in his entire school. His real introduction to the stage came via the Missoula (Montana) Children's Theatre, which consists of two adults touring Western Canada and the U.S. Northwest in a little red truck. During their annual \"week in residence,\" the adults mount a production using local children as actors. Landon's mother, an artist, drives for 14 hours to bring her son to Vancouver to learn, study, and audition. When he's not farming, Landon's father works as a pipeline inspector and supports his son. He also has two older brothers, Lance and Blake who supports his dreams.",
