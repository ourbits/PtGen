    "introduction": "Moving images are pretty talented liars. Often they don’t reflect reality, but the imagination of their creators and yet as an audience we desperately want to believe them.For me as a storyteller there is only one rule: No matter where my audience waches my stories - in their cozy livingroom, a dark cinema or on their phone - no other medium allows me to tell my stories as immediate as moving images do.  I believe that the different forms of moving images are equal and touch their audiences in their own unique way.Personally I like to tell emotional stories about characters that are portrayed as complete human beings given the space to simply be: loud and happy as well as quiet and reflective. Constantly hoping to tell my audience a “lie” they can believe and be touched by, I can be found where atmospheric storytelling meets action-oriented storytelling.",
