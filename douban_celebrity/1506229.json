    "introduction": "Ruby knew she wanted to be in entertainment since she was a little girl. She would sing and dance for anyone that would watch. She graduated from The University of Texas at Austin with a major in Radio/TV/Film thinking she would work in entertainment behind the scenes but it was a job as a co-host of the Austin Music Network that she learned she belonged in front of the camera. After graduation she moved to NYC where she worked on many theater productions, was part of a theater group and a sketch comedy troupe. She has also worked as an international model and actor in the Middle East and is now residing in Los Angeles where her love of acting has lead her to pursue TV and Film.",
