The creators were strongly influenced by both the New Left movement and the women's and gay liberation movements of the 1970s.[4]They also directed International Sweethearts of Rhythm in 1986 which is about African American women musicians performing in the 1930s to 1940s, a 1988 romance entitled Tiny & Ruby: Hell Drivin' Women, and the 1996 documentary Paris Was a Woman.[1] Paris Was a Woman, being about creative lesbians in 1920s Paris, was a labor of love for Schiller and Weiss, taking 5 years to produce and breaking house records.[4] Schiller and Weiss have different areas of expertise which they bring to their filmmaking.[3] Schiller produced Escape To Life: The Erika and Klaus Mann Story (directed by Weiss).
