    "introduction": "Andrzej Bargiel has his older brother to thank for introducing him to the world of skiing. Grzesiek was a mountain rescuer and invited Andrzej to work with him at the Polish village of Białka Tatrzańska, where he had an opportunity to see what his brother's working day looked like.That was the beginning of Andrzej's love for mountains and his passion for ski mountaineering. His brother showed him how to walk on skis and, shortly after, he took part in a ski mountaineering competition, scoring well for a debutant.Grzesiek was his first coach and had a huge influence on Andrzej. He trained alone in his home town of Łętownia, often at night, starting with small goals – and today he's still setting new ones.His first big summit was Mount Elbrus in Russia, but his goal is to finish in the Himalayas and ski down from all the Seven Summits. He got a step closer to achieving that goal when he completed an incredible first descent of K2 on skis in July 2018.",
