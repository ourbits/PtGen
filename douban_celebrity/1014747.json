    "introduction": "In early high school, Jon began developing his filmmaking craft. After gaining experience in directing, producing, camera, writing, and editing, Jon completed the Film Foundation program at the Vancouver Film School. Jon's first short film Apt. 310 played eleven film festivals and garnered two awards for Best Short Film. In 2004 Jon received a grant from the Ontario Arts Council to direct the short film The Other Celia. He followed this experience with the critically acclaimed short film Still Life. Each film played numerous festivals and Jon was awarded Best Director for both films at the Malibu Film Festival in 2006. After the successes of his short films, Jon parlayed his experience into his first feature film Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer. The film gained considerable attention throughout the festival circuit and received rave reviews. His second feature, The Shrine, premiered at the 2010 FanTasia Int'l Film Festival and won the Audience Award for Best Canadian Feature. Jon's latest feature film is a psychological thriller called Goddess of Love, starring Alexis Kendra.",
