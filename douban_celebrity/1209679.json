    "introduction": "Alexander Kaminer was born in Baku, Azerbaijan (a former USSR republic). After the national conflict, his parents fled to Israel where they settled as new immigrants. There he graduated with a Mechanical Engineering degree and soon enough was dispatched to the military service. After demobilization, fortune played his way and he ended up in Los Angeles. In his early teen years Alexander thought about writing and even tried to write a novel. Only after he arrived in Los Angeles did he finally go back to it. While writing, he was very intrigued by the idea of characterization of his own heroes, began impersonating them and fell in love with the process. He studied with Jack Colvin (reporter Jack McGee in \"The Incredible Hulk\" television franchise) for six years and mastered the famous Michael Chekhov acting technique. You can catch him on LifeTime channel, in Patricia Cardoso's, \"Lies in Plain Sight\", \"MacGyver\", \"The Brave\", various commercials and theatre plays and a recurring character in HBO's acclaimed series Barry. In addition to his stage and film career, Alexander Kaminer is an accomplished voice over actor and a stuntman (SEAL Team). In 2017, with the help and vision of his wife, Katherine Lujan, Alexander formed his own production company, Kaminer Studios. Its goal is to fuse quality art films with social issues of today. His critically acclaimed feature, \"LIFT\" won numerous international awards. The company concentrates on projects with a socially oriented tilt and addresses the essence of human existence.",
