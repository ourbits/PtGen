    "introduction": "Son of the legendary amateur and professional wrestler Verne Gagne, Greg Gagne had a fulfilling career himself as a professional wrestler. Although he never quite achieved the status of heavyweight champion like his father, Gagne was a two-time American Wrestling Association (AWA) tag-team champion with partner \"Jumping\" Jim Brunzell (later one-half of the WWF's \"Killer Bees\" combo in the 1980s). Together the \"High Flyers\" ruled the AWA tag-team title in the late 1970s and early 1980s defeating several teams, including one led by now Minnesota Govenor Jesse \"The Body\" Gagne had several shots at AWA Heavyweight Champion Nick Bockwinkel, but always came up short. Gagne quit the sport in the early 90s shortly after the demise of the AWA.",
