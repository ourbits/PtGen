    "introduction": "Dash McCloud booked his first theatrical role on \"9-1-1\" on Fox (2019) followed by many non-union commercial spots. His breakout role came as Noah in Disney's \"Let's Be Tigers\" (2021) where he starred opposite of Otmara Marrero. His credits grew: ABC's \"The Rookie\" (2021), NBC's \"Kenan\" (2021), Tabitha Brown's \"Tab Time\" (2021). In fall of 2021, Dash relocated to Atlanta to play his first recurring role as Jessica Biel's son in Hulu's \"Candy\" (2022) then back to Los Angeles to play Bill Burr's son in \"Old Dads\" (2023), followed by a guest spot on Nickelodeon's \"Face's Music Party\" (2022), and Liberty Mutual's national commercial spot playing Doug's son driving alongside his baby emu sidekick. Fall of 2022, Dash booked his first pilot/series regular role for FX where he filmed with producers Warren Littlefield, Kathy Ciric, and director Mike Barker in Sicily and Berlin. Unfortunately with the strike and an industry contraction, the pilot was not picked up. In the spring of 2023 he went on to book the last episode ever of \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" (2024), a top of show guest star (currently under NDA), and a supporting role in \"Venom: The Last Dance\" (2024), opposite Tom Hardy. After delays from the strike, filming for Venom resumed in early 2024 with a release date in fall 2024. In addition, Dash has sixteen commercial credits. Although Dash loves to act, his first passion is baseball. He also loves to sing, dance, and play basketball at the park. His favorite past time is hanging out with his family and friends and just being a kid.",
