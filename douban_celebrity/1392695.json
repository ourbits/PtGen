    "introduction": "Chulayarnnon Siriphol was born in 1986. He is interested in exploring new possibilities in creating moving images. He is thus working between the role of a filmmaker and an artist, using video as a medium. His works range from short film, experimental film, documentary to video installation which are in-between personal memory and social memory, documentary and fiction, reality and supernatural. Through these pieces, he questions the belief of virtue and ideal through sarcasm, illusions, and his own sense of humor. His short film Vanishing Horizon of the Sea won Special Mention from the 2014 Singapore International Film Festival. His other short films have been screened in many film festivals, for example, The 34th International Film Festival Rotterdam, Netherlands (2005), Yamagata International Documentary Film Festival, Japan (2011), The 11th International Film Festival Hannover, Germany (2011), Arkipel: Jakarta International Documentary & Experimental Film Festival, Indonesia (2015). His solo exhibitions include Ghost Orb, Eat Me Restaurant, Bangkok, Thailand (2011), Behind the Painting, curated by Hiroyuki Hattori, the Art Centre, Silpakorn University, Bangkok, Thailand (2015), Museum of Kirati, Bangkok CityCity Gallery, Bangkok, Thailand (2017). Siriphol has taken part in group exhibitions such as The 5th Fukuoka Asian Art Triennale, Fukuoka, Japan (2014), 19th Contemporary Art Festival Sesc_Videobrasil, São Paulo, Brazil (2015), Soil and Stones, Souls and Songs, Para Site, Hongkong (2017), Enigmatic Majorities, The Academy of the Arts of the World, Cologne, Germany (2017), Ghost:2561, Bangkok, Thailand (2018). His latest short film, PLANETARIUM, premiered at 2018 Cannes Film Festival as part of 10 YEARS THAILAND, a feature film by 4 Thai directors (Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Wisit Sasanatieng, Aditya Assarat and Chulayarnnon Siriphol) in the Special Screenings section. Now, he is currently living and working in Bangkok.",
