    "introduction": "Growing up in Atlanta, Georgia, Sarah loved to perform from an early age, frequently putting on plays with her sister and cousins. After seeing a local production of Annie at age 7, she caught \"the bug\" and began participating in theater at her school. Her middle school and high school years were occupied by theatre and acting. In her junior year of high school, she was cast as Emily in the play Our Town. It was this life-changing part that made her realize she wanted to pursue a career in acting. She got her first Film and Television agent at age 17 and has been pursuing acting professionally ever since. She has recently graduated from Wake Forest University with a degree in Psychology. Sarah can be seen in several film and television roles including Fox's Sleepy Hollow and the Investigation Discovery Channel's Your Worst Nightmare.",
