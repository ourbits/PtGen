    "introduction": "Anne Wheeler, OC (born September 23, 1946) is a Canadian film and television writer, producer, and director.[1] Graduating in Mathematics from the University of Alberta she was a computer programmer before traveling abroad.[2] Her years of travels inspired her to become a storyteller and when she returned she joined a group of old friends to form a film collective. From 1975 to 1985 she worked for the NFB where she made her first feature film, A War Story (1981), which was about her father, Ben Wheeler and his time as a doctor in a P.O.W. camp during World War II. The war is a common theme in her work and she revisited it later in her films Bye Bye Blues (1989) and The War Between Us (1995). Her first non-NFB film was Loyalties in 1986.",
