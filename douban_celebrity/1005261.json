There he booked The Doors, The Who, The Grateful Dead, Jefferson Airplane and other popular bands of the day. For a while, Russo managed the careers of The Manhattan Transfer and Bette Midler. In 1979, he produced \"The Rose\" which gave Midler her first starring role. After producing a string of films and directing \"Rude Awakening.\" Russo turned to blending politics with entertainment. He tried to sell a pilot for a television show called \"Aaron Russo's Mad As Hell\" in the early 1990s.
