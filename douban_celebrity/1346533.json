    "introduction": "Known primarily for his supporting lead role as Detective Duffy in The Boondock Saints film series starring Willem Dafoe.Born in the Boston area and raised outside Chicago, Brian got his first stage experience singing with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra as a member of the renown Glen Ellyn Children's Chorus. There he was trained by original founder Barbara Born, to sing classical symphonies in French, German and English, for world famous conductors including George Solti, and culminating with his solo performance as the Christ Child in a French symphony with the full Chicago Symphony Orchestra.After graduating high school in Western Michigan, Brian enrolled in the Flight Technology Bachelors program at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and flew Cobra helicopters for the US Army. He resigned after ten years to pursue his lifelong goal of professional acting, and immersed himself with live theater training and performances in Monterey/Carmel California.In 2013, Brian was finally able to merge his extensive aviation vocabulary with acting, when he was hired to consult and perform voiceover/looping dialogue for studio films, beginning with Lone Survivor, Fury and Suicide Squad. He now splits his time and energy working to become a better actor on camera and in front of a microphone.",
