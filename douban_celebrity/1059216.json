    "introduction": "Alford appeared in three productions with Birmingham's Town and Gown Civic Theatre, whose director called up Alford's mother to see if her son was interested in auditioning for the part of Jem in To Kill a Mockingbird.[1] Initially Alford had refused, but agreed to audition under the condition that he would miss half a day of school.[1] As one of the three finalists, he was called to New York City for a screen test several weeks later[1] and won the role of Jem Finch.During the filming, his parents drove to Hollywood to be with him, and his sister became the stand-in actress for Mary Badham, who played Jem's sister, Scout, in the film.[citation needed] He and Badham were constantly bickering and at odds with each other during most of the shoot; at one time after their worst argument, he had planned mischief against her.[1]Alford's other acting credits include: Bristle Face (1964) (TV); the role of \"Boy\" in the Jimmy Stewart classic Shenandoah (1965); The Intruders (1970) (TV); and Fair Play (1972) (TV).Phillip Alford is currently a successful businessman in Grenada, Mississippi and stays out of the limelight. He followed his father into the construction business.[2] Alford is married and has two children.",
