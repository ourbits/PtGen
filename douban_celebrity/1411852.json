However, it was her compelling performance in \"Badhaai Ho\" (2018) that catapulted her to renewed acclaim. She garnered widespread recognition and appreciation, clinching three prestigious awards - the National Film Award for Best Supporting Actress, Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress, and the Screen Award for Best Supporting Actress - all testaments to her enduring talent and contribution to Indian cinema.",
