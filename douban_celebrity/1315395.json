    "introduction": "A proud native of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, Steve was inspired at an early age to pursue a passion for performance after taking part in an elementary school production of the Lion King. A play where, according to his account, he \"stole the show\". However, like many kids from his part of the world, playing hockey took precedent over all and he began a lengthy affair with the sport.It wasn't until in his late teens while playing competitively in his hometown, that injuries began to plague his future with the game. Steve then considered his first love and, fostered by the overwhelming support from his beloved community, made a bold choice to abandon hockey and head west to attend the Vancouver Film School Acting program. From day 1, he felt as though he had made the right choice. Steve says: \"The only advice I've ever been able to give truthfully is, do what you love.\"Soon after graduation, Steve got his first gig which sent him north of the 60th parallel to the Yukon territory to take part in a buddy-flick webseries called Yukonic! It featured homages to famous films in a beautiful part of the world and was a great way to further hone the skills he learned of being on a film set, and included memorable moments such as trudging through 3 feet of snow in -40 C temperatures embodying the crazed Jack Torrance in a tribute to \"The Shining\".Steve then moved to the city of Toronto where, while spending most nights on friend's couches and some cramped in his tiny Jetta, he had the pleasure of being cast in minor roles in various television shows such as Nikita, Blue Mountain State, Alphas and Suits. He also had the wonderful opportunity to return to Nova Scotia to incarnate the recurring role of \"The Colorado Kid\" on the Syfy series Haven.",
