    "introduction": "Austin was born in Tarzana, California, and raised in nearby Palos Verdes.[2] She has Serbian ancestry through maternal grandparents born in Serbia.[3][4] Austin also has a younger sister Kristy Williams and three younger brothers. As a small child, her brother would mispronounce her name, saying \"Cole Cole\" or \"Co-co\" in place of \"Nicole\". Eventually her family began addressing her as Coco. The family moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico when she was 10. She grew up as a tomboy, riding quads and playing football.[2] Austin began dancing (jazz, tap and ballet).",
