    "introduction": "Back in the '30s & '40s, before they started using the metal-lined holsters & buscadero rigs, one of the fastest was a singing cowboy named Eddie Dean.  Incidentally, both Roy Rogers & Gene Autry considered him \"The best cowboy singer of all time.\"  He had a baritone voice that was just short of operatic quality.  He was also a major song writer.  Every one of his movies had at least 3 songs in it & he wrote 80% of those songs.  He kept writing songs after he quit making movies in 1948, & a lot of 'em were chart-toppers.by大壮",
