    "introduction": "Virginia Fox (April 2, 1902 – October 14, 1982) was an American actress who starred in many silent films of the 1910s and 1920s. In 1924 she married film producer Darryl F. Zanuck, with whom she had three children, Darrylin Zanuck, Susan Zanuck, and Richard Zanuck. The couple separated in 1956 over the studio mogul's affairs with other women, though they were never legally divorced; but according to Zanuck biographers, she cared for him at their home from the time he became mentally incapacitated in the early 1970s until his death in 1979. Virginia Fox Zanuck died of emphysema and cerebral thrombosis at age 80. She is buried next to her husband in Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.Despite some Internet accounts to the contrary, Virginia Fox was not related to William Fox, whose name is preserved in the company 20th Century Fox, which Darryl Zanuck created and led for decades. William Fox founded Fox Studios, but had lost control of it by the time Zanuck acquired it and merged it into his own empire.",
