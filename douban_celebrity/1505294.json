    "introduction": "Andrew Ghai is an actor of Korean and Indian descent, raised by a single mother in Salem, Oregon. His love for acting began early, when he landed the lead role in a middle school play. Though sports dominated his high school years, he never lost his passion for the stage.

He supported himself by working in family-owned restaurants while studying improv at the Westside Comedy Theater. During this time, he co-created the award-winning teams Thunderbulge (as seen on The Gong Show) and Air Force Fun while also beginning his foray into hosting. This new path led him to Maria Menounos' Popcorn Talk Network, where he and his best friend launched Action Movie Anatomy.

In 2018, he became a commentator for Supercell's Clash Royale League, hosting events worldwide, including - Japan, China, Finland, and at The Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.
