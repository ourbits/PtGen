    "introduction": "Pallavi Paul is a New Delhi-based visual artist and film scholar. Her practice interrogates how the idea of “truth” is produced and argued in public life. Paul is particularly interested in the tension between the document and its aesthetic utterance—the documentary. She received her PhD in Film Studies from the School of Arts and Aesthetics, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi. Her work has been exhibited in venues including Tate Modern, London, Beirut Art Center, SAVVY Contemporary, Berlin, Contour Biennale, Mechelen, and The Rubin Museum of Art, New York. She currently lives in Berlin as a DAAD visual arts fellow.",
