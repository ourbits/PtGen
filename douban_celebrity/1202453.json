    "introduction": "Canadian filmmaker Blake Mawson, a 2017 CFC Director fellow, captivates audiences with engaging storytelling, unconventional characters, and his striking visual style. His debut short, PYOTR495 (2016), addressed anti-LGBTQ+ hate and violence in Russia, winning global acclaim. Presented at 100+ festivals, it earned CSA's lead actor award for Alex Ozerov, a Best Direction nomination for Mawson, and the NFB's A&E Filmmaker Award. The film was also nominated for awards such as the Iris Prize and Sitges International Fantastic Film Festival's Brigadoon 'Paul Naschy Short Film Award'. Mawson's directorial range shines in music videos for queer country icon Orville Peck (Vogue premiere) and Juno-winning rockers Crown Lands (RollingStone premiere). In 2022, he was asked to conceive a custom horror teaser for Mike Flanagan's series, The Midnight Club. In 2023, he directed all six episodes of CBCGem's LGBTQ+dark comedy, I Hate People, People Hate Me, which premiered at Tribeca 2023. Mawson is developing his debut feature, a supernatural thriller titled, Perennials, with Wildhood producer Gharrett Paon, while continuing to expand upon his distinct creative footprint globally.",
