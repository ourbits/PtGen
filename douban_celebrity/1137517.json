    "introduction": "Rebekah Ryan is a British female pop vocalist and songwriter.In 1996, signed to MCA Records, her debut single, “You Lift Me Up” was released and was well reviewed generally, and a large national club hit in the UK. The single also reached the Top 40 in the UK Singles Chart.The follow-up, “Just A Little Bit Of Love” was not so well received by critics, dubbed by many as a shoddy imitation of her debut hit single. Nevertheless, it was a moderate club success, and like its predecessor, was produced by popular dance outfit K-Klass. However, the single failed to reach the Top 40 and also (very narrowly) missed the UK Top 50.Early in 1997, “Woman In Love” was released to mixed reviews. This was a cover of the Barbara Streisand hit. “Woman In Love” is essentially a ballad with hip-hop and R’n’B undertones. The soulful track was generally well-promoted in the media, but it did not sell well, entering the chart at #64 and disappearing from the chart the following week. Rebekah Ryan did have an album in the pipeline, at the time, and was due for release around mid-1997. However, it was decided not to release it. Presumably this is due to Ryan’s previous two singles failing to emulate the success of her debut single.In 2001, with a new record deal, Ryan re-emerged with a totally different sound, style and image. Whereras before, her material had been dance-pop/soul, it was now rock-pop. Her album, “Big Trouble (Lots of Fun)” was released (Jive records) despite the presence of a hit single to ‘promote’ it. The album sold poorly. However, many respected journals praised the record and compared Ryan to Alanis Morissette. The lead single, “You Think You Got The Right” benefited from universally good reviews, and also good promotions. However, it missed, albeit narrowly, making an appearance on the UK Top 75. In 2002, still on Jive records, Rebekah Ryan released a brand new single, “Can I Depend On You?”. It did not chart.",
