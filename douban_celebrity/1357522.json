    "introduction": "Overview (2)Birth Name\tDeanna DillHeight\t 5' 6\" (1.68 m)Mini Bio (1)Deena Dill got her start in television portraying the broken-hearted love interests of Billy Ray Cyrus, Aaron Tippin, Trace Adkins, and over 2 dozen other country stars in their music videos. But, Deena somehow parlayed that sad, sad country heart into a bona fide career both in front of and behind the camera. Deena is one of the creators and executive producers of \"Oh Sit!,\" the CW's high-stakes, high-octane, extreme musical chairs show. \"Oh Sit!\" was initially picked up for 10 episodes and began airing in the summer of 2012. The hour-long, prime-time competition show is created and executive produced by Phil Gurin, Richard Joel, and Deena Dill and produced by The Gurin Company and 405 Productions in association with Warner Horizon Television. \"Oh Sit!\" moves into its second cycle in early 2013. As an actress, Deena recurs as the perky neighbor Bliss on ABC's \"Suburgatory\" and as Gibby's mom,",
