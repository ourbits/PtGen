    "introduction": "As a symbol of the urban panorama of music and fashion, Achille Lauro is rebellion and diversity, an emblem of a way of life. A popstar, rockstar, punk rocker, glam icon, bohemian writer, he transforms the tales of Pasolini's Rome into neorealist music. He has two mix tapes under his belt, an EP, and four studio albums. His fifth album, 1969, esteemed by critics for the avant-garde sound taken from the decade of '60/'70, brought Achille Lauro before the greater public as the most eclectic, innovative, and controversial Italian artist. A revelational personage at the 69th and 70th Sanremo Festival show, he shook the biggest Gala of Italian music, bringing artistic/cultural performances inspired by celebrated historic figures on stage (St. Francis of Assisi, Ziggy Stardust, the Marquess Luisa Casati Stampa, and the Tudor Queen Elizabeth) with a concept that aims to incentivize personal freedom and self-determination. He collects platinum records, partnered with large multinationals in the industry, and in parallel, he rakes in countless collaborations, from the cornerstones of urban music to the giants of pop, to the brands and fashion designers.",
