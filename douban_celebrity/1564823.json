    "introduction": "At five years old, London-based actor Rupert Turnbull was cast in his first professional role, filming in Canada as a central character to play Genevieve O'Reilly and Tim Roth's son, Petey Worth, for the Sky Atlantic series, Tin Star. There followed further travel for TV roles, including Budapest for The Alienist, Belfast for Mrs Wilson and, most recently, Belgium as a series regular for all three seasons of the ITV series, Professor T. Rupert was first cast in a big screen film role as a lead character, Barnaby Hargreaves, playing the son of Anna Chancellor and Hugh Dennis in Nativity Rocks, which premiered for Christmas cinema release in November 2017. A further Christmas cinema release followed his voicing of Tiny Tim in the Timeless Films/Netflix Animation, Scrooge, alongside another stellar cast including Olivia Colman and Luke Evans. Screen experience has also extended from the stage for Rupert, performing as Nancy Carroll and Rory Kinnear's son, Guido 'Fawksey' Marx, in the Bridge Theatre's first-ever production, Young Marx, and selected for the cast to broadcast in cinemas worldwide via National Theatre Live. In 2023, Rupert filmed the lead character, Isaac, in the feature Daddy's Head, which had its World Première at Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas, and is due to be released as a Shudder Original on October 11, 2024.",
