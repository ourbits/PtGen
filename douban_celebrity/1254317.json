    "introduction": "Before becoming a director, Sam Rocco was a struggling actor, mediocre hip-hop producer, and Air Traffic Controller. He spent his childhood in New Jersey watching Spielberg movies and pretending to be a Ninja Turtle. He has a totally normal obsession with comics and action movies, and is determined to one day make a buddy-cop-action-film that may or may not involve dinosaurs. Rocco spent five years in the United States Navy and received an MFA in Film Production from USC. When not writing or directing the next big 90s vampire movie set in an arcade, Rocco spends most of his time teaching his dog to dance, eating bean burritos on his motorcycle, or writing third-person bios about himself.",
