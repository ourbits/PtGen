    "introduction": "Azriel, affectionately called Azi by friends and family, started acting at the age of 4 when he filled in for another child as the \"boy with blue face paint\" in a scene of the indie feature film Blue Hour (2021).Azi often tagged along to auditions and sets with his older brother, Aias Dalman, and decided to try acting because it \"looked so fun!\" Azi asked his mom to submit him for an audition like his brother and not only did he get selected to give it a try, but he booked the lead role!Azi started kindergarten in September 2018, and the following week he filmed The Gift (2020). He's since worked on many films and commercials, his first Network booking being a supporting role in the Lifetime Movie The Neighbor in the Window (2020) as the son of Jamie-Lynn Sigler. Among Azi's favourite projects are Debris (2021), Soul (2020), and he even flew to Montreal to be in Moonfall (2022), Directed by Roland Emmerich, the Director of Independence Day (1996)! No matter the role, Azi loves every minute of being on set.When he's not acting, he likes to build with Lego, play with his Transformers collection, write comics, and read. He swims in the ocean every day, even when it snows, and also recently started learning ballet, hip hop, and karate. His favorite shows are The Office (2005) and Brooklyn Nine-Nine (2013), and he can quote pretty much everything Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) have ever said.",
