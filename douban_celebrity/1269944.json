    "introduction": "Personal lifeBorn in Sudbury, Massachusetts, Evans is the son of Bob Evans, a dentist, and dancer Lisa.[citation needed] He studied theater at New York University.[2][3]Chris Evans told The Advocate in February 2009 that his brother was openly gay.[2] In a June 15, 2009 interview with AfterElton.com, Scott Evans discussed the fact that he had come out at age 19 before he had pursued acting professionally. He said, \"I didn’t want to be one of those people who goes back into the closet and tries to hide because I knew it would come out. With the success of my brother, I didn't feel it was necessary to hide it once I'd come out. I'm an out person, as opposed to an out actor, I suppose.\"[2][edit]CareerEvans began playing the recurring role of police officer Oliver Fish on One Life to Live on January 15, 2008.[4] He subsequently appeared briefly on Guiding Light as Trey in 2008, and guest-starred as Woody Sage in the June 22, 2008 Law and Order: Criminal Intent episode \"Betrayed\" as well as the role of Ben in the October 21, 2008 Fringe episode \"The Cure.\"[2] Evans was also seen as Chad the Mail Clerk in the 2009 film Confessions of a Shopaholic.Initially brought in to One Life to Live for five episodes, Evans returned several times.[2] In July 2009 it was confirmed that his character Fish would become involved in a romantic relationship with another man.[5][6] The storyline came to wider attention when Patricia Mauceri, an actress who had played a recurring role on the One Life to Live since 1995, was replaced after reportedly voicing personal religious objections to her character's involvement in his storyline, which involved his character being romantically linked to another man.[5][6]The Oliver Fish storyline on One Life To Live was canceled and Scott was let go.",
