    "introduction": "Levison Wood is a British explorer, writer and photographer who has published six best selling books and produced a number of critically acclaimed documentaries which have been aired around the world. He has travelled and worked in over one hundred countries worldwide overcoming challenges that would stop most people in their tracks.  Last year he returned from his most ambitious expedition to date; a 5000 mile circumnavigation of the Arabian peninsula from Iraq to Lebanon.  His passion for adventure and discovering more about indigenous ways of life has led him to walk the length of the River Nile, traverse the Himalayas and conduct scientific research in Central Africa for the Natural History Museum.  Levison spent a number of years as an Officer in the British Parachute Regiment, where he served in Afghanistan fighting against Taliban insurgents in Helmand and Kandahar. He is an elected Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society, the Explorers Club, and visiting Fellow at CASS business school.",
