He constantly works to hone his craft, looking forward to the challenges and projects ahead of him.Born and raised in Toms River, NJ, Michael began his foray into the arts by becoming a drummer, but it wasn't until high school that he discovered his love for acting. He pursued his passion, obtaining a B.F.A. in acting from Montclair State University, and continued to follow his passion to New York, which he called home for many years. Now located in Atlanta, he looks forward to taking his career to the next level.Working as both an actor and a founding member of Thaumatrope Films, he is constantly challenging himself by finding new projects, reading new scripts, or writing his own. Michael is at home both in front of the camera and on stage, and loves to bring a positive energy to the set that is both undying and contagious. Full of drive, ambition, and humor (with a touch of sarcasm), he loves to push limits, erase boundaries, create amazing art, and help people reach new heights.
