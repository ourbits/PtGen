    "introduction": "Louise Baillieu is a model with an extra passion for what she does. With a degree in fashion design, she looks beyond the backstage area to a future as a stylist or designer. For Louise, fashion is more than a game of dress up - it’s a vehicle to engage with current affairs and political ideas in the world. Since she competed in Elite Model Look France in 2014, she has walked for designers like Valentino, Dior and Givenchy. She sat down with us to talk inspiration, her favourite designers and how being a model informs her understanding of the game.",
