    "introduction": "David Quantic was born and raised in Derby, Kansas - a pathetic excuse for a suburb located under the flight patterns of McConnell Air Force Base's B52 Bombers just outside of Wichita. Quantic graduated high school in 1991 and promptly got the hell out of Kansas and (don't ask why) decided to go to Southern Methodist University in Dallas for four years where he received a BFA in Studio Art. After graduating cum laude in 1995, he got the hell out of Texas and moved to New York City where he (barely) survived as a photographer and photographer's assistant. New York was kind of fun, though, and he managed to produce his own art photography while working in the professional photography industry.Just for fun, he enrolled at a community film school and produced two short music movies that ignited his desire to become a filmmaker. Quantic applied to pretty much every graduate film school in America and, heavens to Betsy, he actually got accepted to UCLA. During the Summer of 1999, he loaded up the pick up (chicken coops and all) and drove cross country to LA where he's lived since Fall of 1999.David graduated in the Fall of 2004 from UCLA with three short films under his belt. His first short, After School Special (2002) enjoyed a healthy film festival schedule, shown at Queer film festivals in Atlanta, Minneapolis, Chicago, Seattle, Rochester, Los Angeles and Mexico. Mother's Day (2003) played at festivals nationwide including Palm Springs International. His thesis film, Garden of Eden (2004) was shot on 35mm in Lawrence, Kansas and has made the festival rounds as well as Push It (2005) and _Heart (2006)_ two short DV comedies that have appeared at Outfest LA as well as many other film festivals both in the US and overseas.David currently lives in Los Angeles and produces DV shorts as well as running his own video production company, Qubed Productions. Recent projects have included behind the scenes documentaries for features directed by _Phillip J. Bartell (I)_ and _Grace Lee (II)_. David is also producing and shooting a feature documentary about a gay youth talent showcase called \"Rise Up and Shout\" which will be released in 2007.",
