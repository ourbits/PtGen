    "introduction": "A dual Canadian and American citizen, Jason W. Wong's detailed dialect work and physicality in live performances have earned him positive theatre reviews, as well as a special mention in American Theatre magazine while workshopping a new stage production under the guidance of the Grotowski Institute in Poland. He made his feature film debut under the direction of Wayne Wang and has since appeared in projects with Hugh Laurie, Josh Lucas, and Anthony Edwards. Jason is well known a regional face of PBS in California, and has also become a commercial presence to millions of Americans thanks to long-running national ads for Chase Bank and HomeLight.",
