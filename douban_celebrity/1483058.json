    "introduction": "Adam Ali is a British Libyan actor. Growing up in Manchester, he trained at Television Workshop Salford. He recently received a Film Independent Spirit Award nomination for his performance as 'Zain' in the season finale of Apple TV's 'Little America'. Later this year will see the international release of 'EUROPA', a new Italian American feature directed by Haider Rashid, in which Adam plays the lead, 'Kamal'. Europa has received the prestigious Proxima Award at the Milano Film Network, and 1st prize at Cairo Film Connection. However, his newest project and most personal yet is 'BABA', a short film set to premiere at the BFI Flare Film Festival. Commissioned by British Council's 'More Films For Freedom', Adam co-created this short which is inspired by Libya's embryonic underground LGBT community.",
