In May 1992, Brian signed on as a weather spotter with Meteorologist Jim Giles at KOTV 6, Tulsa, for McIntosh County, Oklahoma. A job he held until summer 1996, when he moved back to Oklahoma City. Brian graduated Oklahoma City University with a Bachelor of Science in History and a Master's in Business Administration. He was accepted to the United States Navy Officer's Candidate School, but was honorably medically discharged after severe stress fractures in both his left and right Tibia and Fibula due to Pes Planus (flat feet).",
