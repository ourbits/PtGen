    "introduction": "In 2009, she was a director's assistant at Dramaten and directed the Danish TV series Thea & leoparden for DR's child TV section; the series has also been broadcast in Sweden and several other countries. The three-part series is about a girl who pretends to be a leopard.[6] Aschan has stated that she likes to use animal parables in her productions to make it more clear about human behavioural patterns.[6]In 2011, she released her first feature film, Apflickorna, which premiered at the Gothenburg Film Festival and won the Dragon Award Best Nordic Film and FIPRESCI awards.[7][8] Apflickorna has also won the award for Best Narrative Feature at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival, Best Cinematography at the Transilvania International Film Festival, as well as a Special Mention at the Berlin Film Festival.[9] At the 2012 Guldbagge Awards, Aschan and Josefine Adolfsson won the award for Best Script for the film, and the film also won the Best Film and Best Sound categories.[10]In 2011, Aschan was awarded the Stockholm Film Festival's newly created long-film scholarship of 5 million Swedish kronor (about €550,000, ₤480,000, or $770,000 in 2011) for her new project, Det vita folket, a science fiction-inspired story about the camps where the government places foreigners that are awaiting deportation.[7][11] Aschan declined the money as she did not feel that her project fell under the rules of the award.[7] Aschan has described Det vita folket as a space epos with inspiration from the horror film The Shining.[12][13] The film had its premiere in 2015.[14]At the 2016 Guldbaggen Awards, Aschan was filmed in the audience giving the finger and saying \"Fuck You\" to Swedish cinematographer Gösta Reiland.[15] This was after Reiland had won the award for Best Cinematography, and was on his way up to the stage to receive the award.[16] Linda Wassberg, who had filmed Det vita folket, was also nominated in the same category, and Aschan called it a \"spontaneous reaction\" to Wassbe",
