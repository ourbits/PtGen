Ultimately, her strategic gameplay threatened even her allies, leading to her blindside.In Caramoan, Brenda was appreciably less conniving, forming several genuine friendships and emerging as one of the most well-liked and honest players of the season. After a deep run as a member of the dominating Stealth R Us alliance, this persona led to her again becoming identified as a significant threat, resulting in an emotionally-charged blindside.",
