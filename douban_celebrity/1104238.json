    "introduction": "Kristen Elizabeth was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. Her father Bill was a film critic and her mother Linda a teacher. Kristen started acting at a very young age. Even though her father did not want her to be a working child actor, she always knew that being a performer was the life for her. After working in Hollywood for several years in her late teens and early 20's, Kristen left the industry due to a combination of breast implant illness and being a #metoo Hollywood survivor. Kristen has worked with some of the most respected names in Hollywood such as Garry Marshall, Tim Conway, Henry Winkler, Dan Aykroyd, and many more. She also spent time behind the camera in film and television production. As a print model she appeared in several international magazines. As a professional dancer she was a preliminary guest judge on Fox networks So You Think You Can Dance, she also worked as a professional exotic dance choreographer, and owned and operated multiple pole dance studios. Kristen holds a BA in Media & Film Studies with a minor in Theater Arts. Kristen is currently (2023) working as a film intimacy professional, acting coach, dance instructor, and Intimacy Coordinator/Consultant/Choreographer for film and television in the Pacific Northwest. She has been working in the entertainment industry for over 30 years. Her acting students have appeared in lead roles on Netflix, Hulu, AppleTV, in major motion pictures, and on Broadway. She teaches her own unique method of acting, film intimacy, and dance based on decades of study and personal experience. She combines physicality with psychology in a way that keeps the performer both physically and emotionally safe.",
