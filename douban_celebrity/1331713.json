    "introduction": "Andini was born on 6 May 1986, the eldest daughter of filmmaker Garin Nugroho.[1] Although uninterested in cinematography for fear that she would be \"work[ing] in her father's shadow\",[2] she began studying photography while still in junior high school, hoping to \"capture people's life and behavior\".[1] While in senior high school her classmates often asked her father about filmmaking, questions which Andini later said \"ashamed\" her because she knew nothing of her father's oeuvre.[1] She later began to become involved with several film committees. Andini completed a degree in sociology at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia.[1]",
