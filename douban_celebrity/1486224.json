    "introduction": "María Duval was born in Querétaro and later moved to Mexico City, where she began appearing in television and theatre productions. She made her film debut in the musical Melodías inolvidables (1959). By 1961, she had recorded several albums and was studying tirelessly to enhance her promising film career. Over the next few years she became one of the most sought-after actresses of the '60s cinema of Mexico. She worked with various popular stars more than twice: with Santo in Santo vs. las mujeres vampiro (1962), Santo vs el estrangulador (1965), and Espectro del estrangulador (1966); with Marco Antonio Campos and Gaspar Henaine (Viruta and Capulina) in Barridos y regados (1963), Cada quién su lucha (1966), and La cigüeña distraída (1966); and with Antonio Aguilar in Gabino Barrera (1965), Juan Colorado (1966), and Los alegres Aguilares (1967). She reached the peak of her career in 1966, the year in which seven of her films were released.",
