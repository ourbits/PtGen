    "introduction": "Kim Carnes /kɑːrnz/ (born July 20, 1945) is an American singer-songwriter.[3] Born and raised in Los Angeles, California, she began her career as a songwriter in the 1960s, writing for other artists while performing in local clubs and working as a session background singer with the famed Waters sisters (featured in the documentary, 20 Feet from Stardom). After she signed her first publishing deal with Jimmy Bowen, she released her debut album Rest on Me in 1972. Carnes' self-titled second album primarily contained self-penned songs, including her first charting single \\\"You're a Part of Me\\\", which reached number thirty-five on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart in 1975. In the following year, Carnes released Sailin', which featured \\\"Love Comes from Unexpected Places\\\". The song won the American Song Festival and the award for Best Composition at the Tokyo Song Festival in 1976.",
