    "introduction": "Date of Birth\t6 November 1955, Topanga Canyon, California, USABirth Name\tKatherine Susan HunterMini Bio (1)Born Katherine Hunter, this skinny bombshell of an actress started off with a guest appearance on Hawaii Five-O (1968) but got her first break when she starred alongside Meat Loaf, of all people, in the 1980 film Roadie (1980). After that, she landed a role in Porky's (1981) as Wendy Williams, the only female member of the gang. While merely a sex object in the first film, her character really evolved in the second film, giving her much more depth than most of the male stars in the subsequent films. A very pretty, and surprisingly versatile actress, it is a shame she did not stick to films after loyally finishing off the Porky's trilogy. Kaki currently resides in Moab, Utah, where she juggles being a white water rafting instructor and building houses.",
