    "introduction": "Tonto, a ginger tabby, was co-star and an integral part in the road movie Harry and Tonto (1974). He appeared with Art Carney, who played his owner, in more than half the scenes. Betty Schumacher, Tonto's trainer, used pieces of liver to tempt him to get close to Carney. In the end, human and animal developed a close bond and Tonto eventually approached Carney happily without the need for food rewards. Carney later admitted to growing attached to the feline though he had not been terribly fond of cats in the past. He even offered to buy Tonto himself, but his trainer refused to part with him. Carney ended up winning a Best Actor Academy Award in what was arguably his most famous role, while Tonto won the 1975 PATSY (Performing Animal Top Star of the Year) Award, the animal equivalent of an Oscar.",
