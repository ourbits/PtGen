    "introduction": "Sosie Ruth Bacon (born March 15, 1992) is an American actress and the daughter of actors Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick. She was largely isolated from her parents' careers during her childhood. Bacon's first role was playing the 10-year-old Emily in the movie Loverboy, which was directed by her father. James Duff, producer of The Closer, was compelled by Bacon's performance in Loverboy to suggest that she play the role of Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson's niece Charlie in the fifth season of the show. Although her parents were opposed to her being involved in acting, Bacon accepted the role and appeared in four episodes alongside her mother, who played the role of Chief Johnson. She portrayed the character of Skye Miller in the TV series 13 Reasons Why.",
