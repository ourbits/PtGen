    "introduction": "Kourtney Richard is a creative storyteller and producer with the unique ability to share poignant compelling stories. After graduating from Texas State University with a Journalism degree, Kourtney moved to New York City to pursue a career in journalism. She wrote articles for companies like TheYBF.com, BET, MTV, and Madonna's company \"DanceOn\". She soon realized her passion for storytelling with a goal set for writing TV and film. In 2011, Kourtney moved to Los Angeles, CA where she began writing comedy sketches for Hart Beat Productions, All Def Digital, and Issa Rae's Peak.TV. In the fall of 2017, the producers of Embassy Row, in partnership with CBS, selected Kourtney to write Star Trek Discovery's post show titled \"After Trek\" -- a recap show hosted by Matt Mira. She then went on to write more after-shows for series like Power and The Boys. Later Kourtney was staffed on Coop & Cami, Ask The World, Sydney to the Max, Raven's Home, and Saturdays - all on Disney Plus. She has also written movies for Lifetime, Vh1, and TVOne.",
