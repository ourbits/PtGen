    "introduction": "Hormann, a German-American born in Kingston, New York, won the Bavarian Film Award and the Silver Max Ophüls Award for her directing debut SILENT SHADOW (1991) – to which she also wrote the script. The HFF graduate started her career as a set designer in Dominik Graf’s early works TIGER, LÖWE, PANTHER (1987), to which she also wrote the script, and SPIELER (1989). Graf “rewarded” her with a role in Hormann’s hit FATHER’S DAY (1996). The relationship comedy pulled in more than 1.5 million viewers. Before that, Hormann has already made a name for herself as a comedy specialist with FRAUEN SIND WAS WUNDERBARES (1994, to which she also wrote the script) and WIDOWS (1997). In the field of television Hormann directed programmes such as “Bella Block”, “Meine Tochter ist keine Mörderin” (2001), three episodes of “Der Kriminalist” (2006) and the Bavarian Television Award-wining two-part miniseries “Helen, Fred und Ted” (2006), a comedy about therapists with Friedrich Thun, Andrea Sawatzki and Christian Berkel. She caused a furore at the cinema with her last work as a director, GUYS AND BALLS (2004) – where she combined the subject of homosexuality with football. Sherry Hormann also wrote the script for DESERT FLOWER, based on Waris Dirie’s eponymous bestseller.",
