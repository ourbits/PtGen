    "introduction": "Never short of projects, Rodrigue Jean has been active on every creative front. Currently, he is a film director, writer and producer. In the 1980s, following studies in biology, sociology and literature, he began working in live performance as a dancer and choreographer. In 1989, he turned to filmmaking, and his first short film, La Déroute, was based on choreography from his dance company, Les Productions de l’Os. In the 1990s, he received a grant from the Canada Council for the Arts to study choreography and theatre directing in London, where he discovered the worlds of Shakespeare, Jean Genet and Brad Fraser.

In 2006, he returned to the milieu of sex workers and drug addicts, a culture he was familiar with from his time in London, where he led video workshops at a centre for street kids.
