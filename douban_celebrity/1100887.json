    "introduction": "David Michael Gordon \"Davey\" Graham (originally spelled Davy Graham) (26 November 1940 – 15 December 2008) was a British guitarist and one of the most influential figures in the 1960s British folk revival. He inspired many famous practitioners of the fingerstyle acoustic guitar such as Bert Jansch, Wizz Jones, John Renbourn, Martin Carthy, John Martyn, Paul Simon and Jimmy Page. Graham is probably best known for his acoustic instrumental, \"Anji\" and for pioneering DADGAD tuning, later widely adopted by acoustic guitarists.[2]It was not in Graham's nature to pursue fame and fortune and he retired to relative obscurity for many years, when he engaged in charity work and teaching before beginning to tour again in the years before his death. His obsessive enthusiasm for music never left him, however, and he would gladly give a free private concert to young musicians and old friends.",
