She made her Broadway debut in 2016 opposite Josh Groban in the 12-time Tony-nominated musical NATASHA, PIERRE AND THE GREAT COMET OF 1812, notably becoming the first South Asian female in a principal role since BOMBAY DREAMS, which Playbill called \"a personal milestone and a key moment on Broadway.\" Among her numerous stage credits, she starred as Eliza Hamilton in the national tour of the world phenomenon and Broadway smash hit HAMILTON from Lin-Manuel Miranda; and most recently appeared on Broadway in 2020 as Nessarose in WICKED. Film and television credits include the award-winning independent feature film GROWING UP SMITH directed by Frank Lotito, QUANTICO (Mark Gordon / ABC), HALAL IN THE FAMILY with Aasif Mandvi, GOSSIP GIRL (The CW), COIN HEIST (Netflix) and MISTRESS AMERICA directed by Noah Baumbach.
