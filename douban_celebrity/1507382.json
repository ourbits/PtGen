    "introduction": "Natalie Abrams is a dynamic and enthusiastic queer writer most known for co-creating the series Gotham Knights for The CW. Abrams started out as an entertainment journalist for outlets such as TV Guide and Entertainment Weekly, where she also co-hosted Sirius XM's weekly live radio show Superhero Insider.Having grown up being impacted by the stories she'd obsessively watch on TV, Abrams traded in her decade-long reporting career with a goal of having that same impact on others. Abrams became a writers' assistant on All American, where she wrote and produced her first episode of television. After that, she penned a freelance episode of Supergirl before being staffed on Batwoman, where she worked her way up to Executive Story Editor and penned a Batwoman tie-in comic for DC Comics.From there, Abrams made the jump to creator. With Berlanti Productions, she helped pen the DC Comics adaptation of Gotham Knights for WBTV and CW. Natalie was recently honored as a graduate of the highly acclaimed WGA Showrunner Training Program. An avid comic book reader, with an astute ability to decipher the intricacies of even the most puzzling genre shows, Abrams strives to tell diverse stories that feature authentic queer representation.",
