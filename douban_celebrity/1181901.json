It was a performing arts school, so I can't say if it was a typical experience or not, because it's all I know.Someone was asking me what my favorite outfit is, and 100%, without a doubt in my mind, is my forever lazy.I have had just an excess of energy. That's why I've always been active.I feel very strongly that young women have regressed a little bit. But I do get all preachy about it.I live in a constant state of hyperbole.I don't realize how rare it is to genuinely have sincere love for everyone you work with. Especially in Hollywood,",
