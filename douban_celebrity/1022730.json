    "introduction": "The resolutely tall and striking American actor Peter Hermann boasts a resumé that reads like a best-of American television series during the '90s and 2000s. After playing Dr. Michael Burke on the soap Guiding Light for two years (1997-1998), Hermann often appeared on various popular shows not as a mainstay, but as a guest star or a several-episode fixture. These included Law & Order, Spin City, Sex and the City, and 30 Rock. Hermann also played the recurring role of Trevor Langan on the hit drama Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. On the set of that program, Hermann met actress Mariska Hargitay, whom he married in 2004; the two had their first child about two years later. Hermann took his first significant cinematic bow in 2006, when he portrayed Jeremy Glick in the broadly acclaimed, gut-wrenching 9/11 drama United 93. In 2008, he took on the regular role of Davis Draper, the ex-husband of one of the main characters on the prime-time drama Cashmere Mafia, but the series lasted only seven episodes.",
