He also played the character Grey Bradnam, one of the narrators of the film, and provided the majority of the background voice work in the film, including the cameraman Trent.[2][3] In a deleted scene of the movie, Cope also played a doctor at a clinic visited by the film's protagonist, who was seeking to have his arm amputated due to being infected with alien DNA. The scene is featured as part of the movie's DVD \"extras.\"In 2010 he also had a costarring role in the South African-produced film Spud, opposite veteran actor John Cleese.In 2012 Cope had a minor role in DREDD 3D as one of the thugs killed during the film's introduction sequence.
