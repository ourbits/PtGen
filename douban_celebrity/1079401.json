    "introduction": "As a comedy team, known as Mr. & Mrs. Sidney Drew, the team perfected the situation comedy style that the team of John Bunny and Flora Finch started. Their style of comedy was usually gentle satire on married life, but also poked fun at the world of show business. Sidney took sole credit as director for two five-reel features at Vitagraph, the groundbreaking cross-gender comedy A Florida Enchantment (1914), in which Edith Storey played the leading female role, and the drama Playing Dead (1915), the Drews' only attempt at a \"serious\" film.[citation needed]In 1916, the popular team was lured to Richard A. Rowland's and Louis B. Mayer's newly founded Metro company, where they continued to dominate in the field of marital comedy. During World War I, Sidney Drew's son, actor-director S. Rankin Drew, was killed in action. Drew never recovered from the loss. The team left Metro for personal appearances but was signed to V.B.K. Sidney Drew died suddenly on April 9, 1919. Lucile McVey Drew died in 1925 from cancer, at the age of 35.",
