    "introduction": "Richard Ladkani has gained international recognition for his award-winning feature documentaries. His 2016 Netflix Original, “The Ivory Game,” executive produced by Leonardo DiCaprio, produced by Walter Köhler and co-directed by Kief Davidson, was shortlisted for an Academy Award. An investigative docu-thriller about the illegal ivory trade and the threat of elephant extinction, the movie premiered at the Telluride and Toronto International Film festivals and won multiple international awards. In early 2015 Ladkani and his wife, Anita, founded Malaika Pictures to produce films that shine a spotlight on the most pressing environmental and political issues facing the world today. They are currently developing a scripted feature film based on the bestselling book “City of Thorns,” chronicling the plight of refugees, in one of the largest UNHCR camps in the world, Dadaab, in Kenya. Among Ladkani's most renowned films are “Escape Over the Himalayas,” “The Devil's Miner,” “Jane's Journey,” “Vatican: The Hidden World” and “Gas Monopoly.” His signature “you-are-there” approach to filmmaking gives audiences an immediate and visceral connection to his subjects. He lives near Vienna, Austria, with his wife and two daughters.",
