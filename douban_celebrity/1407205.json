    "introduction": "Nik Schodel was born in Brisbane, Australia in 1981. He was raised in Cairns, Far North Queensland. At 5 years of age Nik began training in Karate, in which he went on to win many state and national titles, represented Australia in international competition and was named Australian Traditional Karate Federation male black belt of the year in 2002. With an interest in all martial arts, he also was a national Taekwondo competitor, is proficient in many weapons and trains in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. While at the World Martial Arts Games in 2000, Nik met a team of stunt performers and was inspired to pursue a career in film action. He then moved to the Gold Coast, where he cut his teeth in the Police Academy live action stunt show for Warner Bros, expanding his skill set to include cars, motorcycles, falls, and fire. With his ability to learn versatile skills and his mentality to always perform at the highest level, Nik crafted a successful career in film which has now spanned over two decades and has taken him all over the world on major Hollywood productions. During his many years as a stunt man Nik was mentored by some of the finest Stunt Coordinators and 2nd Unit Directors in the business. This allowed him to build a strong eye for camera and develop a keen sense for creative stunt sequences. With his knowledge, skill and experience Nik moved into Stunt Coordinating and Action Directing, striving to design inspiring and unique action pieces.",
