    "introduction": "David Mcallum, who modelled his playing on Fritz Kreisler (one of Mantovani's favourite violinists) had a distinguished career, mostly in the classical field. He was born in Kilsyth, Scotland, on 26 March 1897 and won a Royal College of Music scholarship at the age of 14. In 1922 he broadcast as a solo violinist for the first time. Between 1932 and 1936 he led the Scottish Orchestra in Glasgow under Sir John Barbirolli, then was asked by Sir Thomas Beecham to lead the London Philharmonic Orchestra. In wartime he led the National Symphony Orchestra and played with the London Studio Players and the BBC's Overseas Music Unit. When Beecham resumed after the war with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, he took David as his leader and they toured America in 1950. By 1952 McCallum led the London Symphony Orchestra.",
