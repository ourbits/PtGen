    "introduction": "Born in Germany and educated in both Bavaria and the United States, Torsten developed his strong passion for the arts, particularly for acting at a young age, he participated in various school and community theater productions as a teenager. After high school he attended Clemson University, earned a Bachelor's degree and began work as a corporate consultant. In that role, he learned the value of having a professional work ethic, the art of communications, working with and leading large teams and finally, the importance of preparation to achieve any type of success. During this entire period however, he always knew that something was missing. To alleviate this emptiness, Torsten studied with various professional and acclaimed acting coaches who encouraged him to continue pursuing the craft. Torsten quickly landed his first supporting role in a feature film. With each new production, he gained more experience and eventually landed a co-starring role opposite Jamie Bell in the TV series \"Turn.\" This success motivated him to work even harder. More projects followed in both film and television. Notably a supporting role in the feature film \"Kringle Time\", which garnered best audience award at the Brooklyn Film Festival in 2022. Torsten also landed a supporting role in the feature film \"Condor's Nest,\" working opposite Arnold Vosloo, James Urbaniak, and Academy Award nominee Bruce Davison.After spending a few years in Washington D.C., he and his wife moved to Atlanta, Georgia to be close to the film industry, where he is now pursuing acting full-time.",
