    "introduction": "Mark Steven Johnson (born October 30, 1964) is an American film director and writer.Johnson was born in Hastings, Minnesota and attended California State University, Long Beach. He has directed and co-written the two comic book based films Daredevil and Ghost Rider. His early writing credits are for the film Grumpy Old Men and its sequel Grumpier Old Men. He is often given credit for writing the screenplay for the Marvel film Elektra, but he only produced an earlier draft not used for the finished film.He was writing the pilot for the TV adaptation of Preacher for HBO, however as of August 26, 2008 the project had been canceled by the new head of HBO.In 2010, Johnson attached himself to direct the action-thriller, \"Recoil,\" about a former FBI sniper dragged back into action when his ex-wife is targeted by a deranged Sniper. Nicolas Cage was in negotiation to re-team with his Ghost Rider director, but word now has producers out to an even bigger male lead. \"Recoil\" was written by Adam Greenbaum and Christopher Taylor and re-written by Johnson.In 2011, Johnson attached himself to direct another action-thriller, \"Autobahn,\" in which an unassuming man in a sports car learns his car is outfitted with a deadly bomb and he must race to a certain location in short order to kill a pre-determined target or his family will be killed. The script was written by Gregg Russo, but Johnson will likely re-write. The story is currently set in Germany, but that could change.",
