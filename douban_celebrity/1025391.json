    "introduction": "Bright, vivacious leading lady Marlyn Mason was born on August 7, 1940, in San Fernando, California, and began performing at the age of 5. Encouraged and inspired by her parents, she was given singing and piano lessons while young and appeared on the local \"Doye O'Dell Show\" at age 9. As a young teenager, she was cast in several stage shows with the Players' Ring Theatre troupe in Hollywood, including musical versions of \"Tom Sawyer\" and \"Heidi,\" as well as the legit plays as \"Pick Up Girl\" and \"The Crucible\".In 1956, the 16-year-old Marlyn moved into TV work with multiple episodes of \"Matinee Theatre\". Throughout the 1960s, she would establish herself firmly into in the medium with guest parts on all the popular shows at the time. Blessed with an inviting, effervescent smile, she added spark and sparkle to such lightweight sitcoms as \"My Three Sons,\" \"Father Knows Best,\" \"Gomer Pyle,\" \"Hey Landlord\" and \"Occasional Wife,\" while showing off her dramatic mettle on \"Burke's Law,\" \"Ben Casey\" (a seven part story), \"Dr. Kildare,\" \"Laredo,\" \"Bonanza,\" \"Run for Your Life,\" \"The Invaders\" and \"Perry Mason\" (the original series' final episode). Seldom pigeon-holed, Marlyn offered a palatable range of \"good girl\" and \"bad girl\" interps during this productive time -- from the sensual and alluring to the offbeat and freewheeling. One of her more notable \"bad girl\" roles came in the form of a faithless wife who schemes to murder her lover's wife and set up David Janssen's Richard Kimble character in the process.Marlyn's early singing lessons paid off later when she was signed to co-star with Robert Goulet, Sally Ann Howes and Peter Falk in a special TV-musical version of Brigadoon (1966), following that with the role of Carrie in Carousel (1967) again with Goulet. This, in turn, led to her casting in the George Abbott Broadway musical production of \"How Now, Dow Jones,\" which starred Tony Roberts and Brenda Vaccaro.",
