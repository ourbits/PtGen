    "introduction": "Frédérique Hoschédé was born in 1953, on the 14th July. Her mother was a housewife and her father was an engineer. Discovered by Jacqueline Joubert (director of unit youth from ORTF) in 1973 during a contest, she began her career on the show \"Dorothée and Blablatus\".After the separation of the ORTF in three networks (TF1, Antenne2, FR3), Dorothée appeared in the show, \"Les visteurs du mercredi\", for TF1. After 3 years without work, Dorothée was recalled by Jacqueline Joubert for a new show, \"Récré A2\", as principal character. At the same time, Dorothée met Jean Luc Azoulay, the owner of AB productions, a small record company producing discs for children. AB discs agreed to issue an album by Dorothée every year.In 1987 after 9 years of success, Dorothée left Antenne2 and Récré A2 for TF1 where she created, with AB productions, a new show for children, called \"Club Dorothée\". After 10 years of success, Dorothée closed again its club in 1997.Currently (July 2002), Dorothée prepares a new project for French terrestrial numerical television in partnership with JLA productions (previously AB productions). She has just proposed a channel for children, \"DO TV\".",
