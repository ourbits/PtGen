    "introduction": "Wehn studied Business Administration in Münster and worked in customer relations.[1] In 2002, he moved to the United Kingdom to work in the marketing department of Wycombe Wanderers.[2] One evening, he saw an open mic night and decided to try comedy.[3] Of his decision to stay in the UK, Wehn later wrote: \"I initially planned to stay in the UK for only 12 months to improve my English, but the good weather, the tasty food and the classy women made me stay. In order to blend in with the locals, I decided to get extremely lazy, spend money I don't have and, most importantly, to unjustifiably bang on about my great sense of humour. This is why I decided 1,646 days, nine hours and 42 minutes ago to try my hand at stand-up and become the German Comedy Ambassador.\"[4] As a result, since October 2003, Wehn has been the self-styled \"German Comedy Ambassador in London\".[5] After beginning his career as \"warm-up act\" to various comedians in London (including Stewart Lee for Comedy Vehicle), he now has his own act on the British comedy circuit.[6]",
