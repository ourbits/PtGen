    "introduction": "Born in Uniondale, New York, chef Richard Blais was educated at The Culinary Institute of America where he received an AOS in culinary arts. Blais studied under such food-world luminaries as Thomas Keller, Ferran Adria and Daniel Boulud. In 2000, Blais relocated to Atlanta, GA where he founded Trail Blais, a culinary consulting and creative organization, dedicated to designing and operating restaurants in the city. The company opened a number of popular Atlanta eateries including FLIP Burger Boutique and The Spence. Blais became well-known after appearing on the fourth season of \"Top Chef\" (Bravo 2006- ). Blais did not triumph, but was the runner-up that season, losing to Chicago chef Stephanie Izard. In 2009, Blais returned to the \"Top Chef\" stage, assisting Rick Bayless on \"Top Chef Masters\" (Bravo 2009- ). Blais made yet another Top Chef appearance, competing on \"Top Chef: All Stars\" (Bravo 2011), which he won, defeating competitor Mike Isabella. Following that \"Top Chef\" victory, Blais went on to appear on a number of food related shows, including the documentary series \"Life After Top Chef\" (Bravo 2012), the competition \"Iron Chef America\" (Food 2005-14) and \"Guy's Grocery Games\" (Food 2013- ) with television personality Guy Fieri. In 2013 Blais released his first cookbook, Try This at Home: Recipes from My Head to Your Plate. The book relies on simple methods and invites home cooks to try new flavor combinations for traditional and classic dishes. Blais began hosting his first series, the food trivia and science-themed \"Hungry Games\" (Food 2014) in the fall of 2014.",
