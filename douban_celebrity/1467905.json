    "introduction": "Hello I am Thomas,I have spent the last ten years of my life exploring new avenues like acting in various shows and films like \"The Expendables 3\" or being directed by Tyler Perry in 'The Haves and Have Nots', to modeling for some amazing projects and appearing in the top fitness magazines. New York is the city that helped me to diversify my skill-sets and helped me to discover new hobbies; I am enjoying taking classes at The Gotham Comedy Club and The PIT. I also found a new calling, as an Advocate for Pitbull's rights and rescuing one myself. I am always thankful for all the amazing people that have shared their journey and time with me.And if this wasn't enough, I am also a lifelong athlete coming from France that began training in combat sports at 6 years old and went on to be the 2-time Kickboxing World Champion among many other professional fighting titles.\"Nothing is given, everything is earned... especially in New York\"- IMDb Mini Biography By: Thomas Canestraro",
