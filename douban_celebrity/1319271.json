    "introduction": "Years active\t2002−presentKnown for\tGame of ThronesJack Gleeson is an Irish actor, best known for his portrayal of Joffrey Baratheon in the HBO television series Game of Thrones.***LIFE***Gleeson started acting at the age of seven in the Independent Theatre Workshop. His first roles in feature films were minor roles in Batman Begins (2005), Shrooms (2007) and A Shine of Rainbows (2009). In 2010 he appeared in a leading role in Alicia Duffy's All Good Children. The reviewer for the Variety magazine considered Gleeson \"the pic's big discovery\".He was announced in the role as Joffrey Baratheon on 19 July 2009. Gleeson was part of the initial starring cast and remains a member of the starring cast for the second season. He is a student of Trinity College, Dublin, and a member of DU Players. In 2012, he was awarded a Scholarship at the same university following a competitive examination demonstrating \"exceptional knowledge and understanding of his subjects\". Gleeson has indicated an intention to pursue an academic career rather than a professional acting career, once his work on Game of Thrones is completed.",
