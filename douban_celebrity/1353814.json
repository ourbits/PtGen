    "introduction": "TZ skittered to fame as the fan-favorite GraveRobber in Lionsgate's 2008 science fiction-horror musical REPO! THE GENETIC OPERA. Sometimes howling, sometimes crooning, he perfected the character over years in black box theatres, Off-Off-Broadway productions, and the 2006 short film of the same name. As Lucifer, TZ's commanding baritone booms in the imaginative and irreverent film anthology THE DEVIL'S CARNIVAL. Dubbed a “master of the macabre” by Los Angeles Magazine and voted Scary Stud Of The Year by Fangirltastic, his bellowing vocal cords can soon be heard in the genre-redefining AMERICAN MURDER SONG.",
