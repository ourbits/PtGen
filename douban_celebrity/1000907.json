    "introduction": "Fernando Ramallo was born in Madrid on the 3rd of April, 1980. He had a normal life like any other boy of his age until one day some casting agents went to his college looking for a boy who would star in a movie. That movie was La buena vida (1996), directed by David Trueba. This was the start of his career, at 15. After that he had another chance in Carreteras secundarias (1997), one of his best performances, winning this time a Goya (Spanish academy award) nomination for Best New Actor. He didn't win but he continued working. A short appearance in La mujer más fea del mundo (1999) was his next role, followed by an incredible ignored leading performance in the fantasy film El corazón del guerrero (1999), the debut of director 'Daniel Monzon'. In the year 2000, the film Krámpack (2000) gave him the opportunity of performing a different role, about what happens in a teenager's mind when he falls in love with his best friend. Also in that year, he won an award in the Valencia Young Film Festival, for his \"cinematographic future\". In 2001 he has completed one more film: Algunas chicas doblan las piernas cuando hablan, directed by Ana Díez.- IMDb Mini Biography By: gareth3es@yahoo.es",
