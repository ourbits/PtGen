    "introduction": "James A Stephens was born in Wolverhampton, England. When he left school he wanted to be a painter and go to art school but his father said 'If you think you're going to be a long haired, sandal wearing hippie think again, if you want to draw, study technical drawing,' and so he studied Mechanical Engineering while working for an engineering company. At the the age of 26, with hair on his shoulders he decided to move to London and study drama at E15 drama School (1973- 1976). He worked at many of England's repertory theatre's until 1982 when he moved to the US. He is known for playing Graham Fenwick-Jones on the David Letterman Show. Also known for Sherlock Holmes (2009), The Sorcerer's Apprentice (2010) and All My Children (1970).",
