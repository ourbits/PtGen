Her feature film design work can be seen most recently in Pedro Almodóvar’s The Room Next Door (2024), Todd Field's TÁR (2022), where she received a Costume Designers Guild Award (CDGA) nomination, and the Disney live action movie Mulan (2020), directed by Niki Caro. With Mulan, Daigeler was nominated for her first Academy Award and won the CDGA for “Excellence in Fantasy Costume”. In television, Daigeler designed the costumes for FX's Mrs. America (2020), where she was nominated for an Emmy in “Outstanding Period Costumes”, as well as a CDGA. Mrs. America also reunited her with Cate Blanchett, with whom she had collaborated on the visual art piece Manifesto (2015), directed by Julian Rosefeldt, which was a major success in the art world and awarded Daigeler with the German Film Award for Best Costume Design. Having started her career in German cinema in the mid-80s, Daigeler was drawn to the creative explosion in Spain and has worked since then in multiple Spanish productions and received five Goya nominations.",
