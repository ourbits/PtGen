    "introduction": "Actor Jeremy Luke, Italian and Puerto Rican descent. Native New Yorker came to LA in 2000 and quickly began studying with Joe Palese at The Actor's Space. He began booking guest stars on shows like CSI, Las Vegas, NYBD Blue and many more. Hustling every day as most actors do, the light began to shine on him when he got the call to audition for Joseph Gordon-Levitt in his directorial debut and Jeremy won the spot to play alongside Levitt as his friend in highly anticipated film DON JON. In the same year he auditioned for Frank Darabont (Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile)and was cast as a Series Regular portraying the famed mobster, Mickey Cohen, on MOB CITY for TNT. Next up, he booked a Series Regular on ABC opposite Michael Imperioli on the multi-cam ST. FRANCIS, ( directed by James Burrows) then right after went on to Series Regular on the single cam series PENIS CHRONICALS for Andy Berman at FOX. All the while creating his own material along side his friend Joey Russo and writer / director Justin Schack. It was sent to the team at Fox Digital who green lit the show , which would come to be known as SMALL SHOTS , currently streaming on Amazon Prime. The work he did on this show allowed for his reps to send over scenes to casting and ultimately caught the eye of Clint Eastwood. Clint immediately cast him in his film JERSEY BOYS and only a few years later cast him again in the film SULLY. Soon after his friendship with co-star from MOB CITY was brought back together with Milo Ventimiglia in his recurring role on THIS IS US. In 2018 Robert Deniro and Martin Scorsese watched SMALL SHOTS and offered Luke and Russo the roles of the Andretta brothers who were supposedly responsible for disposing of Jimmy Hoffa's body in the film THE IRISHMAN .Jeremy has also produced and performed in over 20 plays in LA over the years including: THE MOTHER F$CKER WITH THE HAT, LOBBY HERO AND REPLICA.",
