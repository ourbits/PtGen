After honing her craft at the Helsinki Theatre Academy, she embarked on a career marked by memorable performances, building a strong foundation within Finnish cinema through roles in films like Ganes, Tears of April, and Bad Family. Her talent for portraying complex characters earned her recognition, including a Jussi Award nomination for Best Leading Actress for her work in Star Boys.
