    "introduction": "Born in Belgium in 1986, she graduated from the KASK School of Arts in Ghent where she now teaches. She made her debut short film Catherine in 2016. The film went on to screen at over 200 festivals and won several awards. In her spare time, she eats chocolate, listens to indie music, reflects on non-violent communication, admires her plants, strokes as many cats as possible, binges on animations and rides her bike – but not in the snow, because she is scared of falling off. If she is reincarnated, she hopes to come back as a cat named Fluffy and receive many chin rubs.",
