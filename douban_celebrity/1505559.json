She studied acting at several schools around the Philadelphia area, and with her gymnastics and dance background, began training in stunt work. She soon began work as a producer on several productions and eventually learned the other aspects in the many departments behind the scenes in the film industry. Jeni took her knowledge and skills and started her own production companies: Dandeleven Pictures, and Eleventeen Pictures... and has been involved in over a hundred productions in various positions, such as: producing, script supervision, casting, and production management. But her real passion is acting, which she has tried to be versatile with her characters in every genre and format of filmmaking - from comedy to drama, thrillers, action adventure, soap operas, web series, science fiction, horror .",
