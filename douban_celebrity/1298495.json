    "introduction": "Robert Stone was born in England and educated in the United States. He is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin/Madison, with a degree in history. Multi-tasking as a producer, director, writer, editor and cameraman, Stone has over the last 30 years developed a steady international reputation with a range of unique and critically acclaimed feature-documentaries about American history, pop-culture, the mass media and the environment. His work has earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Feature Documentary and two PrimeTime Emmy nominations for Outstanding Achievement in Non-Fiction Filmmaking - among a great many other awards. Four of his films have had their world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival and seven of his films have been aired on the acclaimed PBS history series American Experience. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly has called Stone \"one of our most important documentary filmmakers\" having directed \"two of the most explosively insightful documentaries of the last decade\". He continues to turn out personally crafted high-end documentaries from his home in New York's Hudson Valley, where he lives with his wife, Shelby Stone - a film and television producer - and his two sons from a previous marriage.",
