He has a deep knowledge of 19th and 20th century visual arts. During the 1980s, Dominique Païni managed arthouse cinemas in Paris (Studio 43, Le Bonaparte and Les Ursulines). His passion for art history prompted him to work at the Musée du Louvre at the end of the 1980s. He produced TV series for the general public (Palettes, La ville Louvre, etc) with famous documentary makers : Alain Jaubert, Nicolas Philibert. He was in charge of the Cinemathèque française during the 1990s, transformed it and prepared its move to its new Frank Ghery building in the East of Paris in 2004. He then became one of the directors of the Centre Pompidou : he programmed pluridisciplinary exhibitions (on Roland Barthes and Samuel Beckett), performing arts (danse, drama), modern music, contemporary literature, philosophical and aesthetical debates, symposiums and conferences. In parallel, he organised exhibitions of international scope, based on innovative concepts in France, Europe and North America :Hitchcock et les arts(2001) Jean Cocteau, sur le fil du siècle (2003) Voyage(s) en utopie de Jean-Luc Godard(2006) which was adapted to the Centre Culturel de Oi Futuro (Rio, 2013) La main numérique (in France in 2008 and in Taiwan in 2010) ABC, Art Belge Contemporain (2011 at the Fresnoy, Lille.)
