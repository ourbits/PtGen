    "introduction": "Claire Margaret Corlett (also: Claire Brown) is a Canadian-born actress from Vancouver, British Columbia. She is primarily known for voice roles in animation: her first demo was recorded in 2004. She was only 5-years-old at the time. Corlett's first notable role in animation was voicing Sally Brown in the \"Peanuts Motion Comics\" (2008). The series consisted of 20 short film adaptations of the famous comic strip \"Peanuts\" (1950-2000). Corlett next voiced Tiny Pteranodon in \"Dinosaur Train\" (2009-2020). Corlett also voiced Dizzy, the tilting drum cement mixer in the American dub of \"Bob the Builder\" (2015-2018). The series was a British-Canadian co-production, and a reboot of the older series \"Bob the Builder\" (1999-2011). On the screen, Claire made her debut performance as Frank in Hallmark's, \"Smart Cookies\" at age thirteen. She fell in love with TV and Film and has continued to pursue a career beyond animation. In 2020, Corlett started dating her fellow voice actor Gabriel Christian Brown. By 2021, the couple lived together in Arizona and announced their engagement to each other on January 29, 2022. They were married to each other in November of the same year. She has never ceased working on new roles in animation, and she has gained a fan following for well-received older roles. Off of the mic, she works as a video editor for YouTube channels - \"Black Gryph0n\", amassing over 5 million subscribers, as well as the \"Riggle's Picks\" podcast. She is also an executive producer.",
