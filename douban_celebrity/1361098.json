From the time he was born he was always involved in some kind of story time, Kinder Music, theater classes, acting camps etc..In 2014 one of Owens theater teachers asked Owen to perform as a young Beethoven in Beethoven Revealed for a local theater company. After his spectacular performance in Beethoven Revealed, the family was tipped off about a new local management company neighboring West Reading Pa.. The rest is history as they say. They took on Owen as his managers in January 2015 followed by being signed by a New York agency. Since then Owen has been on fire in NYC!",
