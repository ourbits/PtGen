    "introduction": "John Requa is a screen writer (with Glenn Ficarra) of Cats & Dogs, Bad Santa and the 2005 remake Bad News Bears.The DVD commentary for Bad News Bears revealed that Requa was to have had a bit role in the film, but it was not shot.Requa and Ficcara directed Jim Carrey and Ewen McGregor in their screenplay I Love You Phillip Morris.[1]Contents [hide]1 Early life2 Professional career3 Filmography4 References5 External links[edit] Early lifeRequa grew up in Burien, Washington, a suburb of Seattle,[2] graduating from Burien's Highline High School in 1985. His talents as a writer were evident when he wrote and performed in a skit for his senior year Homecoming assembly titled \"Fernbusters.\" It was a morphing of Ghostbusters and the killer Christmas Trees skit from the 1975 classic Saturday Night Live. In it, Requa played the killer fern. For another assembly later that year he wrote a skit about an almighty creator named Sven.Requa attended Highline at the same time as Dana Newton, who is now a senior producer on the Oprah Winfrey Show, and Randy Dixon who is an internationally known improv artist who heads Unexpected Productions in Seattle, and Mike Starr who was the original Bassist for Alice in Chains and recently seen on season three of Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew.Requa graduated from the film program at the Pratt Institute in the early 90s.[3] While there he met and began his long association with writing partner Glenn Ficarra.[edit] Professional careerAs best as is known, all of John Requa's professional work has been in association with his writing partner Glenn Ficarra.Requa and Ficarra wrote numerous episodes of The Angry Beavers, an animated show in production on Nickelodeon from 1997 until 2001. Their first episode was season two's Kandid Kreatures which they followed with Dag for Night, Un-Barry-ble, Zooing Time, Sans-a-Pelt and Gonna Getcha. They went on to write eleven more episodes over the remaining three seasons of the show.[4]Following the success of Cats & Dogs and Bad Santa, Requa was set to direct (again with Ficarra) Woody Harelson in their script Jack Tucker, Trucker.[5] Announced in Variety on February 10, 2004, the film has yet to be produced and is not currently listed on the Internet Movie Database.",
