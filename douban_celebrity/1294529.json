    "introduction": "Victoria Pile created the concept of Green Wing. She also was the producer, casting director, script editor and film editor on top of being one of the eight writers! As a result Victoria is generally considered to be the 'boss' of the show. Her role within the writing team was mainly to take the ideas and jokes provided by the other writers and from this choose the direction the plot would take.Victoria also produced the ground breaking 'Smack the Pony' which, as mentioned above, the writers and many of the GW cast are also connected to.Before creating her own programmes Victoria provided a couple of sketches for the BAFTA award-winning 'Not the Nine O'Clock News' and also helped write the now largely forgotten series 'Karen Kay', 'Pushing Up Daisies' and 'Lazarus & Dingwall'.",
