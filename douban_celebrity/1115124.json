    "introduction": "Nacho Martínez (8 July 1952 – 24 July 1996), born Ignacio Martínez Navia-Osorio, was a Spanish actor.Born in Mieres, Asturias in 1952, Martínez began his film career as Tasio's brother in the movie Tasio directed by Montxo Armendáriz in 1984. However, the character for which he will be most remembered for is the bullfighter in the film Matador in 1986, Pedro Almodóvar, where he co-starred with a very young Antonio Banderas. With Almodóvar, he also acted in Law of Desire (1987) as well as High Heels (1991).In 1986, Martínez was a candidate for Fotogramas de Plata as best actor, coincided with Ángela Molina in La Mitad del Cielo, by Manuel Gutiérrez Aragón, and had a small role in the cult movie Viaje a Ninguna Parte, directed by Fernando Fernán Gómez.Along with his film career, Martínez had a long career as a voice actor in dubbing, film, and cartoons.Martínez died after a long battle with lung cancer at the age of 44, which cut short the career of one of the most influential Spanish actors of the 1980s.In 2006, Martínez was remembered at the twentieth edition of the Goya Awards.",
