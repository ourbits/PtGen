    "introduction": "Maïwenn (sometimes credited as Maïwenn Besco or her birth name Maïwenn Le Besco, French: [maj.wɛn lə bɛs.ko]; born 17 April 1976) is a French actress, film director and screenwriter.In 2006, she directed her first feature film, the semi-autobiographical Pardonnez-moi. According to Maïwenn, after Besson learned she planned to use her own money to produce the film, he told her \"You need to immediately stop what you're doing. You're crazy. Nobody puts their own money into a movie.\"[1] After seeing the film he apologized, saying she was right on this occasion.[1] Her second film was Le bal des actrices (2009, All About Actresses), in which she appears as herself making a documentary.[4] She achieved international recognition when her third film, the social drama Polisse (2011), won the Jury Prize at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.[2] All three films feature Maïwenn with a camera, stemming from a childhood fascination and her interest in the mise en abyme, the story within a story.[4] Her 2015 film Mon roi was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.[5]获得了法国文化部授予的 艺术和文学勋章（骑兵级）",
