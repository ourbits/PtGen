    "introduction": "Katherine Leigh Ritchie (born 14 August 1978[1]) is an Australian television actress and radio personality best known for her long-running role as Sally Fletcher on the television soap opera Home and Away, for which she won two Gold Logie awards. She played the character for 20 years from 1988–2008. Prior to her retirement from the role, she shared with fellow original cast members Ray Meagher and Norman Coburn the record (recognised by Guinness World Records) for the longest continuous role in an Australian drama series.[2] After a five-year absence, Ritchie returned to Home and Away in 2013 for a short reprise of her role as Sally Fletcher to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the series.[3] In addition to 20 years on Home and Away, Ritchie has also hosted various television events and appeared in commercials, a mini-series and an Australian film. She has also been involved with the Campbelltown Musical Society.[4]",
