    "introduction": "Lisa Spilliaert (1990, Tokyo) lives and works in Ghent, Belgium. Her fascination for genealogy and the constant shifting between her cultural backgrounds are recurring motifs in her autobiographically inspired work. Before working in film, Spilliaert trained as a photographer at KASK School of Arts Gent.In the video Hotel Red Shoes (2013), Spilliaert's debut realized in collaboration with her sister Clara, we discover how she skillfully translates the quality and power of her photographic work into moving images.Her second video work, Growth Record 1 (2014), is the foundation of a series of annually produced videos that steadily document a baby's growth into adulthood through photography and film.Spilliaert's films have been screened at the following film festivals: Image Forum Festival (Tokyo, Kyoto, Nagoya and Yokohama), International Film Festival Rotterdam, Art Cinema OFFoff (Ghent) and Beursschouwburg (Brussels).Her feature film debut, N.P, premiered at the international competition of FID Marseille in 2020 and was further screened at Berwick Film & Media Arts Festival (UK), Literatur Film Festival Münster (DE), Underdox Munchen (DE) and Black Canvas Contemporary Film Festival (MX). In the autumn of 2021, the film will premiere in Japan.",
