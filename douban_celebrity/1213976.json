    "introduction": "Los Angeles based but Canadian born, producer with US roots from Ohio, Benjamin Easterday has been working in film and television for over 30 years and as character types go he is often seen as the aggressive or authoritarian type, Benjamin also plays the nicer sidekick and family man types. Versed in all facets of film production from transportation to executive, Benjamin has a filmography that includes network television, feature film, independent film, US National Ad spots and film transportation crewing, all grown over 20 years. With a background in Marketing/Sales, Business Management and life of the \"Practical Producing Artist\", he transcends the gap from theory to practice by embarking on small business and film development projects.In the mid 90s, Benjamin lived in Australia and had the pleasure of developing and initiating marketing strategies for the Australian Marketing Institute. In 1998, Benjamin returned to Canada and the hustle of the film industry as cast and crew on network productions (SG-1, Dead Zone,Smallville), independent features, associated with Hallmark, Lifetime, Cinetele, Legacy Filmworks, Insight Film, Shavick Ent, Ignite, Nasser, and Johnson Group. In 2005 interest turned more to producing and after taking a few courses, found the way while practicing with scripted and unscripted television; in 2007 producer credits came with Archetype Pictures and other Los Angeles based projects. In 2009, Easterday joined Everyday Tomorrow Pictures as a Producer and in 2012 added stunt /safety coordination and script development to his backpack of skills. In the last few years more web and project developments have become his passion with projects now maturing with Discovery Education and other viable ventures under EV Productions Inc.",
