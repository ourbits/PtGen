    "introduction": "Jim Leonard was born and raised in small towns in Indiana. He attended Hanover College, then moved to New York where he was lucky enough to become a playwright-in-residence at the prestigious Circle Repertory Theatre. Jim premiered numerous plays Off Broadway. He learned to write for TV and movies from the late-great Robert Altman who advised him not to worry too much about proper screenplay format, and instead to just write a letter to the director, telling him what you wanted to see, how you wanted it to feel, and what people said. Jim moved to Los Angeles where he's been writing letters to directors ever since.",
