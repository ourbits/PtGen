    "introduction": "Quinn Shephard is an actress, writer and director based out of NY.Her first feature-length screenplay, Blame, was selected as a finalist for the Sundance 2014 Screenwriters Lab. Her short story 'Brighter' was the runner up for the 2014 One Teen Story Writing Contest, judged and reviewed by YA author Tara Altebrando, who called it \"wonderfully claustrophobic...a spot-on depiction of how visceral, competitive, and fragile adolescent relationships are.\" Past directorial work has been screened at the Garden State Film Festival.In 2012, Quinn booked a series regular role in the CBS/Jerry Bruckheimer pilot Trooper (not picked up) and recurred on CBS's Made in Jersey. Shortly after graduating early, Quinn teamed up once again with CBS/Jerry Bruckheimer for the 2013/2014 series Hostages. Here she starred alongside Dylan McDermott and Toni Collette, playing Morgan Sanders, an angst-ridden teen daughter turned hostage. Quinn followed up the run of the series with appearances on The Blacklist and Believe before beginning a recurring arc as antagonist computer hacker Claire Mahoney on Person of Interest and starring as sassy small-town cheerleader Kat in the indie feature Windsor (all 2014).Quinn is also a regular on the soon-to-air DirectTV series Almost There, where she plays a mischievous and sexy psychology student, Scarlett.Shephard was born and raised in the New York area.",
