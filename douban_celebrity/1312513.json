    "introduction": "The English animator Daniel Greaves, born in 1959, usually mixes several different techniques in his films. His most famous examples of such mixes are \"Manipulation\" (1992), that won him the Oscar and the Cartoon D'Or at Cannes, and \"Flatworld\" (1997), an entertaining and surprising narrative created entirely in stop-motion, where 2D cardboard characters sneak around a scenery made of real objects.Daniel graduated in animation at the West Surrey College of Art in 1980. In 1986, he founded Tandem studios with his business partner Nigel Pay. In the Animated Chat with Daniel Greaves, we will get to know a little more about his still very successful career.",
