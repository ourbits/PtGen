    "introduction": "妈妈供职于德国汉莎航空公司，父亲和哥哥是IT男，When Nadia Hilker was 17 years old, she and her mother flew from Munich to Berlin to meet with a potential acting agent, despite the fact that Hilker had never acted a day in her life. “I walked into the office and the agent just looked at me and said, ‘you’re an actor, I want you,’” Hilker says. “I thought she was cuckoo!”She booked her first role, a lead in a German TV movie, on her first audition. After a couple of years, though, she couldn’t quite find her place in film anymore. “I played a lot of rebellious young girls, and then I got older and we don’t really have a lot of ‘not a girl, not yet a woman’ parts in Germany, especially not for me as I’m very exotic-looking for Germans,” she says. “I kind of stopped working, and it was really bad. I was broke, my parents had to support me, and I spent years in my apartment just staring at the ceiling.”Her father was once again the one to pull her to acting. “I was thinking about becoming a stewardess,” she says, “and my dad, who is very German in terms of being pragmatic and realistic, just said ‘no, you’re going to give it one more year. And if nothing happens you can quit.’” In that year, she was cast as the lead in an independent film called “Spring.” “I stood in front of a camera again and realized how much I love it and need it and want it.”",
