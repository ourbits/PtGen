    "introduction": "Actor, writer and star of HUSBANDS, a marriage equality comedy.The son of a Gas Station Owner and Fine Artist, Hemeon, was born and raised in the DC metropolitan area of Tysons Corner, Virginia. Having three older brothers, and two younger sisters and a younger brother – Hemeon grew up in a full house. He found time for himself in reading and writing and staying after school for the drama programs. In high school, Hemeon followed his brothers’ athletic legacy and played football and lacrosse. Throughout, though, he felt the pull to do more acting and joined in the theater classes and plays at the school. When it came time to decide what to do in college, there was no doubt that Hemeon wanted to be a performer. He went to Virginia Commonwealth University on a scholarship and shortly thereafter landed his first major acting role on American television in As The World Turns on CBS. He played Max, the first year film student and in having so much fun was convinced this was what he wanted to do. He has since made the move to Los Angeles where he considers it his new home. Recently, Sean Hemeon was excited to play a Vampire on one of his favorite tv shows “True Blood.”",
