    "introduction": "Louis Dearborn L'Amour (/ˈluːi ləˈmʊr/; March 22 1908 –June 10 1988) was an American novelist and short story writer. His books consisted primarily of Western novels (though he called his work 'frontier stories'); however, he also wrote historical fiction (The Walking Drum), science fiction (The Haunted Mesa), non-fiction (Frontier), as well as poetry and short-story collections. Many of his stories were made into films and John Wayne once made the assertion that L'Amour was the most interesting man in the world.[citation needed] L'Amour's books remain popular and most have gone through multiple printings. At the time of his death almost all of his 105 existing works (89 novels, 14 short-story collections, and two full-length works of nonfiction) were still in print, and he was considered \"one of the world's most popular writers\".[1][2]",
