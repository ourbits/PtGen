    "introduction": "Brendan Canty has forged his way as one of the most exciting and prolific Irish directors. His early career enjoyed large success with his video for Hozier's 'Take Me to Church' (which has since surpassed a billion views on Youtube along with two MTV VMA nominations), since then Brendan has gone on to direct consistently elegant and visually stunning music videos for top international artists. In 2017 Brendan directed 'For You' (starring Barry Keoghan) which went on to win a Kinsale Shark and was nominated for an IFTA. In 2019, Brendan directed a second short film - 'Christy' - funded through Screen Ireland, which he's developing as a feature with BBC Films and Screen Ireland, slated to shoot in the summer of 2023. He recently won Best Director at Show Me Shorts Festival for his latest short film Atali'i O Le Crezent (Sons of the Crezent).",
