    "introduction": "Born in 1981, Rodrigo Sorogoyen belongs to a generation that thrives both in television and cinema, bringing a very political perspective on the world around him. With two series to his name - RIOT POLICE and THE NEW YEARS - the director casts a harsh light on society, questions human nature, and brilliantly unites both critics and audiences around a popular body of work.After studying at ECAM in Madrid, he founded Caballo Films and directed his first feature film, STOCKHOLM, which he co-wrote with screenwriter Isabel Peña, who was to become his closest collaborator.Together, they have created staggeringly intense, masterfully directed films: MAY GOD SAVE US, THE REALM, and MOTHER  - the eponymous short film was nominated for the Oscars in 2017. The Madrilenian filmmaker made his debut in Cannes with THE BEASTS, starring Marina Foïs and Denis Ménochet. The film went on to win 9 Goya Awards, including Best Film and Best Director, as well as the César for Best Foreign Film.",
