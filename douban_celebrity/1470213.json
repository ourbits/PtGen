    "introduction": "New Zealand born actress Phoenix Cross had no idea the spotlight would land on her. Winning top academic student four years in a row and being an avid animal lover, Phoenix thought her life would lead her into becoming a vet. So how did Phoenix get her start in acting?In 2018 Phoenix first tasted the limelight when she agreed to help her friend make a short film 'Once More With Muchness'. Quickly after it was released, Phoenix started receiving auditions and went on to land the lead role in New Zealand Film Commission 'Kokako', lead role in horror slasher 'Buzz Cut' and made her New Zealand TV debut as Awa in 'Ahikaroa'.However, Phoenix has gotten most of her new found attention from playing the lead role of Willow in 'Baelin's Route', spear headed by Viva La Dirt League who have amassed an impressive 6 million plus fans from their comedic content. And with 'Kokako' being set to premiere at Toronto and Berlin film festivals in 2022, Phoenix's success will only grow.The story of this young Kiwi starlet is an admirable one, so keep an eye out! You'll be seeing her on a screen near you soon!",
