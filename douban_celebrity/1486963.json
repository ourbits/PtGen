As a vocalist, Nolen was named the Most Promising Junior Male Vocalist and Most Promising Vocalist in regional competitions in British Columbia, Canada.When not acting, dancing and singing, Nolen spends time with his family - he is the middle child of 3 boys - and loves his two dogs, Louie the Labradoodle and Phoebe the Bernedoodle.",
