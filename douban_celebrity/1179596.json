    "introduction": "Theater, film and television actress, Geneva Carr, was born in Jackson, Mississippi and lived in Michigan and the Carolinas before moving to Atlanta, where she graduated high school. Following graduation from Mount Holyoke College with a degree in French, she moved to Paris. There, she earned an MBA from the prestigious ESCP Europe Paris campus.While working for a French bank on Wall Street, Geneva turned in her resignation after seeing an off Broadway play that awakened her true calling. She spent the next few years bartending and playing hostess in Manhattan hot spots, such as Pastis and The Waverly Inn, working full-time while booking voice overs, commercials, short films and doing lots and lots of innovative off and off-off Broadway theater productions.Just before landing the role of Marissa Morgan on CBS's hit series, Bull (2016), she was nominated for the Tony Award for \"Best Actress in a Play\" for her headlining role as Margery in the critically acclaimed Broadway production of \"Hand to God.\" Carr lives in New York City with her Burmese cat, Eartha Kitty, and Eartha's half brother, Hoffman. Geneva is fluent in French and speaks conversational American Sign Language. She loves entertaining friends at home, very dry champagne and very dark chocolate.",
