    "introduction": "Imagine packing up your life and heading across the continent to pursue a dream - Matthew Clarke did. The West Australian born actor started building his career 5 years ago, leaving a promising AFL calling to focus solely on acting. Sydney became his new home, where he took classes at the Actors Pulse and continuous workshops with Anthony Brandon Wong. He has secured roles in numerous productions. Matthew has a solid list of credits - a supporting role in the feature film Damaged and a role in the Foxtel crime feature Westrook. He was the lead in the Sydney Mardi Gras closing ceremony video clip that has reached over 5 million views on line. As well as a main role in the theatre production Superstar and hero roles in commercials such as Vodafone, Vicks, TimTams and many more.Arguably Matthew's greatest achievement has come with the web series, The Horizons, which has reached over 50 Million views on Youtube and recently filmed a pilot with the Director of 'The Adventures of Pracilla, Queen of the Desert', Stephan Elliot. Matthew brings amazing energy and commitment to each of his projects and it's this attitude that's seen him build his career so quickly.",
