    "introduction": "Siska graduated from the Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts in Beirut with a master’s degree in cinema studies and film directing. He has been living in Berlin since 2009. His practice is often centered on archiveology examining sociopolitical narratives in relation to personal and collective pasts. Siska’s work often questions the ruination of Arab cultural heritage. His use of film language and codes of cinematography as strategic mediations to activate an archive allows him to experiment with new forms of storytelling and his own biography. Siska’s work has been exhibited internationally, including Gropius Bau, Berlin, Centquartre-Paris, Beirut Exhibition Center, Mosaic Rooms, London. Siska’s Bayna Hayakel Studio Baalbeck (2017) was part of Forum Expanded 2018.",
