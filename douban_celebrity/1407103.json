    "introduction": "Writer/director Barbara Peters was one of the few female filmmakers who specialized in entertainingly trashy low budget drive-in exploitation fare in the 70s and early 80s. Peters often worked for Roger Corman's B-flick studio New World Pictures. She made her feature debut as co-writer and co-director of the soft-core lesbian outing \"The Dark Side of Tomorrow.\" Barbara followed this movie with the gritty distaff biker item \"Bury Me an Angel,\" the amusingly silly comedy \"Summer School Teachers,\" and the enjoyably inane \"Starhops.\" Peters achieved her greatest notoriety with the wonderfully nasty horror creature feature winner \"Humanoids from the Deep.\" Moreover, Barbara handled second unit director chores on the car chase pictures \"Moving Violation\" and \"Eat My Dust,\" designed the costumes for \"The Fabulous Bastard from Chicago,\" and was the art director on \"The Young Nurses.\" She acted in \"Gun Runner\" and \"Caged Desires\" (Peters also wrote the script for this one). Barbara Peters ended her career directing episodes of such TV shows as \"Misfits of Science,\" \"Shadow Chasers,\" \"Falcon Crest,\" \"Remington Steele,\" \"Cagney & Lacey,\" and \"Matt Houston.\"",
