    "introduction": "Born in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada and raised on a small farm in Fonthill, Ontario, Ms. Ayers was drawn to the performing arts since childhood, participating in school plays and choir, studying dance and singing. While working on her Bachelor of Education, she portrayed the Emcee in a stage production of 'Cabaret'. Several roles followed in regional theatre before moving to Toronto to study acting. As the lead in 'Rebecca', she caught the eye of an acting coach who referred her to a top agent. Although she considers theatre her first love, she works primarily in TV and film.",
