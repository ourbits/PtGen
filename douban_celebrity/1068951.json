    "introduction": "Sophie Dahl grew up in the midst of a greedy extended family, whose members all loved to cook and eat. Despite building a successful modelling career, Sophie eventually left the catwalk and instead followed in her grandfather Roald’s footsteps and dedicated herself to writing.After the success of both a novella and a full-length novel, Sophie published her first cookery book, Miss Dahl’s Voluptuous Delights, in 2009. The recipes were inspired by Sophie’s childhood memories and the travelling she did as a model. Some of the book’s recipes were brought to the screen for BBC2’s The Delicious Miss Dahl, broadcast the following year.Sophie lives in London and is a regular contributor to both fashion and food magazines.",
