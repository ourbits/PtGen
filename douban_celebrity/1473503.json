    "introduction": "美国女演员，以在John Carpenter1976年的动作片《血溅十三号警署》（Assault on Precinct 13）中饰演被围困的警察局勇敢的秘书Leigh而闻名。Zimmer had a brief acting career during the mid-to-late 1970s. After playing the female lead opposite Darwin Joston and Austin Stoker in Assault on Precinct 13, Zimmer appeared on stage in a Los Angeles production of the John Ford Noonan play, Getting Through The Night, where her performance was reviewed as \"a model of prissiness and timorous self-importance\".[1] She then appeared (as Laura Fanning) in the 1977 comedy spoof American Raspberry, and two 1977 French films: Jean Eustache's Une sale histoire (\"A Dirty Story\") and Charlotte Szlovak's Slow City, Moving Fast (also known by the French title D'un Jour a L'Autre). Shortly thereafter, Zimmer's career stalled, and, after playing her fifth role (in 1979's television movie Survival of Dana), she permanently retired from acting.",
