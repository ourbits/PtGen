    "introduction": "Preston Oliver is an American actor born and raised in Las Vegas, NV. Preston took an interest in acting in 5th grade when he secretly auditioned for his elementary school play \"Peter Pan\" and was cast a supporting role as a pirate. While this gave him the acting bug, he decided to continue drama in 6th grade where he quickly found the love for acting and the people. This led to additional acting classes where he soon connected with Coast to Coast Talent Group and made his acting debut at 12 years old, portraying the role of Riley Boyd on NBC's Chicago Fire (2019) alongside Taylor Kinney (Severide). 3 months later, he was cast in \"This Is Us\", playing the son of Justin Hartley (Kevin), and booking a DISH commercial all in this same year. Much to his surprise, Preston's passion for acting quickly became a dream come true, as he landed the lead role of Griffin on Disney's Secrets of Sulphur Springs TV series. He considers himself blessed and grateful for these opportunities. In his free time, he loves playing basketball and video games.",
