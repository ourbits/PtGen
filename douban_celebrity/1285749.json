    "introduction": "Jeff Habberstad has been working in film for over 30 years. Starting as a stuntman specializing in aerial work, Jeff quickly made a name for himself, winning the award for \"Best Aerial Stunt\" in one of the first ever Stunt Awards. Jeff has gone on to receive 4 Emmy nominations, winning the Emmy for an action sequence he directed for the TV series, \"Alias\". Before starting in the film business, Jeff attended college in Washington State, specializing in the odd but productive combination of Engineering, Business and Film. This, along with a natural mechanical ability has led to some great innovations in wire work. Jeff has established himself as a creative and innovative 2nd Unit Director. His many notable credits include \"Spider-man\", \"The Sixth Sense\", \"There Will Be Blood\", the \"X-Men\" series and multiple Marvel films, including \"Doctor Strange\", for which he directed nearly the entire 3rd act. As seen on his resume, he has collaborated with many great filmmakers. Jeff is married to his wife, Debbie. They have 3 kids. The oldest, Trevor, an established stuntman and Stunt Coordinator, passed away at 27 from a rare form of cancer, delivering the worst possible blow to our family. Shane is a USC grad and is quickly advancing in the film business. The youngest is our daughter Allie, a USC grad, and the first of the kids to marry.",
