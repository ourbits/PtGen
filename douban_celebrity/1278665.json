    "introduction": "In 1972, Adolfas joined the Film Department at Bard College, which had been founded in 1970 by Jon Rubin and a group of radical students. In the years before his academic tenure, Mekas was an active writer, scholar, and filmmaker. He co-founded (along with his brother Jonas) and edited \"Film Culture\" Magazine from 1953-1976. His extensive filmography includes \"Hallelujah the Hills\" and \"Going Home, \" a personal documentary about his journey to native country Lithuania, his first return since he and his brother survived the country's WWII Nazi invasion. With the continued blessing of St. Tula, the patron saint of cinema, Mekas continues to teach film at Bard College in the Hudson River Valley where he lives with his wife Pola Chapelle.",
