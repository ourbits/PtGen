    "introduction": "Wade Eastwood was born in Durban, South Africa in 1971, the youngest of 4 children. He finished junior school there before his family moved to England. The weather and lifestyle eventually forced a family decision to move back home to SA after 5 years. Once home, Wade finished high school, represented his country in Athletics (100M & 200M sprints) and went in to the Army to complete his compulsory National Service. Wade was 19 when he finished the army and landed his first film job. He had been working as a volunteer lifeguard and part of his duty included air sea rescue along Durban's rough beaches. A film company came to town and was scouting for soldier types to jump out of a helicopter as it flared to a stop over a crocodile infested river. Wade was chosen by the director. After this stunt he was hooked and worked his way, (The hard way) through the ranks, driving, crashing, falling, burning etc....Wade was very driven physically and mentally to be versatile and able to not just do anything, but to master it. He is an accomplished fixed wing & helicopter pilot with many ratings, sky diver & free flier, rescue scuba diver, air/sea rescue crewman, accomplished black belt martial artist, boxer, gold awarded fencer, offshore yacht skipper, highly graded horse rider, has advanced weapons skills and served his country in the armed forces, holds multiple armored car licenses including civilian abnormal load truck and bus licenses and races cars internationally, with a string of wins in Formula 3, Prototypes and Sports cars.After 7 years of performing and stunt coordinating feature films, TV shows and commercial's in South Africa, Wade wanted to move on to bigger and better projects with larger budgets and more scope to create unique action using all the skills he had learned in his life, thus he moved to the UK and LA. Here he started again, working back to back doubling the majority of Hollywood's elite leading men, before getting back to coordinating and 2nd Unit Directing. Wade has worked tirelessly to create unique action and has won and been nominated for a number of Taurus World Stunt awards, SAG Awards, People's Choice Awards, Critics awards etc.. .for his 2nd Unit Directing and Stunt Coordinating work.Wade lives between California and Europe where he can still enjoy his passions, such as surfing and motor racing!",
