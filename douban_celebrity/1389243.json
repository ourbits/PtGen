    "introduction": "Sasie Sealy is an award-winning writer/director based in New York City, with a (still) lingering Southern drawl. She began her directing career studying photography with Gregory Crewdson and writing and performing with the sketch comedy troupe The Fifth Humour. However, her love of striking visuals and physical comedy soon took cinematic form and a lifelong addiction to filmmaking was born.Sasie's films have screened at the Smithsonian Institute and festivals around the world, and she has twice been awarded the short filmmaking prize at the Tribeca Film Festival, with New York Magazine calling her film The Elephant Garden \"one of the most touching and poignant films we've seen this year.\" Her previous short Dance Mania Fantastic was named one of Tribeca's +5, and was picked up for broadcast by PBS and SBS, as well as included in IFP's Buzz Cuts showcase. Sasie has also won numerous grants and support from the Sundance Institute, New York State Council on the Arts, Film Independent, the Sloan Foundation, and the Tribeca Film Institute for her feature script SarahN_12, which was optioned by Focus Features in 2012.Most recently, Sasie has completed a new short with HBO entitled Last Song and starring Ernie Hudson. She is currently developing her debut feature Lucky Grandma and directing commercials for clients like Maybelline, Tory Burch, Movado, Sally Hansen, and the great state of New York.",
