    "introduction": "Born into show business in New York City, Jennifer Youngs grew up on movie sets. She spent the 1990s working as an actress. After three years of playing Ingrid on \"Doctor Quinn, Medicine Woman\", her character was killed off. Youngs decided to put all her energy into her music. She made a CD recording of her band \"What's the Bob\" with musician and producer Ronnie Champagne. They produced \"MOBIUS\", a reincarnation-themed CD, which was performed with actors and props at Masquers Club in Hollywood. To follow was a rock album, \"Jennifer Savage\", for the film \"Karma Chameleon\". In 1999, Youngs and Champagne were invited to Portugal for a six month concert tour. After a few years in Europe Youngs headed back to the U.S. and her native East Coast and made two additional CD's, \"Only Human\" and \"I Like to Watch TV\". In 2007, Youngs headed to Seattle to put a band together and recorded, \"Let Me Go There\". Her most recent album, \"Lovevolution\", was released under the name Jennifer Freedom.",
