His first projects were inspired by console games and films like Bloodsport and Bad Taste. Later, he directed several films featuring a mix of skateboarding, heavy drinking and breakneck stunts in the style of Jackass and CKY. In 2010 he began a film degree and graduated with the short film Epoch. His next short, The Man Who Didn't, won him a place at the Super8 film school. Danmark (Denmark) is his debut feature film.",
