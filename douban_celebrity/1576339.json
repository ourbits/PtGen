    "introduction": "Jason was born in the small hockey town of Trail, British Columbia, Canada. He spent most of his youth playing hockey at the triple A and Junior levels. He later turned towards officiating and eventually worked professionally in the Western Hockey League and the East Coast Hockey League. His on-ice skills landed him jobs in the movie Miracle (Kurt Russell) and The Tooth Fairy (Dwayne Johnson). While working on the Tooth Fairy and sending Dwayne The Rock Johnson to the penalty box he decided to pursue something that he always wanted to do... act and write. Weeks later he had booked his first ever audition and he was hooked. Jason jumped in head first and within two years he was acting/producing/writing the comedy feature Jackhammer (Jamie Kennedy, Pamela Anderson, Robb Wells and Nicole Sullivan) with his friends. The movie would go on to open in four film festivals and get distribution with Phase 4 Films (eOne) and is currently available on demand, Hulu, and iTunes. Shortly after Jason booked a recurring role on ABC's hit show Once Upon A Time playing the legendary role of Little John.",
