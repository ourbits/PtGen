    "introduction": "Adam Rose began his career in entertainment some thirteen years ago when his older brother was approached in the park and asked to audition for a commercial. Days later Rose, along with mother and brother sat in a manager's office, when he stood and interrupted \"I want to act. I want a contract.\" Though only 8 at the time, his charm resonated with the manager who agreed to sign him. A short year later Rose made his debut opposite Robin Williams and Julie Kavner in Woody Allen's Deconstructing Harry.Born to a would-be Rabbinical cantor and an opera singer, Rose embraced music at an early age and excelled at Tap, Jazz, Ballet, and the martial arts training he underwent. It was during this same time that Rose was chosen to be the voice of Peanut for three years, as the title-character on PB & J Otter, a cartoon on the Disney Channel. Soon after Rose would perform under the direction of Michael Mayer (Spring Awakening, Thoroughly Modern Millie) alongside Kristen Johnston and John Pankow in Peter Hedges' Baby Anger. The successful portrayal of a young boy with cancer led to subsequent guest spots on TV's Ed and Third Watch.Having developed a passion for live theater, Rose landed a role on stage with Theodore Bikel in The Gathering and went on to tour with three consecutive productions - including the pre-Broadway tour with Hal Linden. Throughout his time on stage and in recording booths, Rose continued to grow his love for dance, and at age 15 went on to become the youngest to ever teach dance at the renowned Broadway Dance Center in New York.",
