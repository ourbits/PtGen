    "introduction": "James is a queer, neurodivergent and working-class actor and writer originally from the West Midlands. He trained at the Manchester School of Theatre where he wrote his first play for his dissertation, which in 2024 made its debut at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival: an autobiographical solo comedy, 'Good Boy', which explores patriarchal power dynamics in queer relationships and recovering from trauma of sexual violence. (It was also very funny.) After enjoying a five-star sell-out run, James is now represented as a writer by Michael Eliot-Finch with Brennan Artists and is adapting 'Good Boy' for television with Turning Point Productions, a new company from the team behind Endor Productions. With a movement-based training and experience in immersive theatre, James specialises in emotionally-challenging roles with a playful and adaptive nature, ranging from the extreme to the intimate.James now lives in London and when he isn't at the theatre you can find him nose-deep in a novel, watching a horror film, playing video games, or at a drag show.Praise for Good Boy: ***** 'Farley deftly switches between characters... his mimetic skill is outstanding... he's also wickedly funny.'
