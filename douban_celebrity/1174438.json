    "introduction": "Harry Mark Christopher Judd was born 23 December 1985 in Chelmsford, England, to Emma H. (Williams) and Christopher J. N. Judd. As a child, he liked to ride around the family estate in tractors and play cricket, which he finds a greater rush than performing on stage. When he was 17 he auditioned to be the drummer for a new pop/punk band as advertised in NME. That band is now McFly. They soon released a single, 5 colours in her hair, which shot to number 1 and rocketed them to fame. They are also in the record books for being the youngest band to have a number 1 single with their debut. They have since had many more hit singles and a no. 1 album.- IMDb Mini Biography By: mmmkaypanini",
