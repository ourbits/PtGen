    "introduction": "英年早逝的前苏联杰出电影导演，CC收录其两部长片发行于Eclipse系列。Larisa Efimovna Shepitko (Russian: Лари́са Ефи́мовна Шепи́тько; Ukrainian: Лариса Юхимівна Шепітько; 6 January 1938 – 2 July 1979) was a Soviet film director, screenwriter and actress.In 1967 she shot the second of the three stories in the “Beginning of an unknown era” entitled “Homeland of electricity”. The first and the second stories were projected 20 years later. The last one hasn’t been found yet.In 1969 she shot her first color film, a musical fantasy film titled In the 13th hour of the night, a New Year's revue starring Vladimir Basov, Georgy Vitsin, Zinovy Gerdt, Spartak Mishulin and Anatoly Papanov.Shepitko's third film was You and I (1971). This was her second film in color, and the last. It was favorably received at the Venice Film Festival, but lacked proper public exposure in the Soviet Union.The Ascent (1977) was her last completed film and the one which garnered the most attention in the West. The actors Boris Plotnikov and Vladimir Gostyukhin received their first major roles in the film. In it, Shepitko returns to the sufferings of World War II, chronicling the trials and tribulations of a group of partisans in Belarus in the bleak winter of 1942. Two of the partisans are captured by the Wehrmacht and then interrogated by a local collaborator, played by Anatoly Solonitsyn, before one of them is executed in public. This depiction of the martyrdom of the Soviets owes much to Christian iconography. The Ascent won the Golden Bear at the 27th Berlin International Film Festival in 1977.",
