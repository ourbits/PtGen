    "introduction": "Website\tsarahkernochan.comSarah Marshall Kernochan (/ˈkɛərnəˌkɛn/; born December 30, 1947) is an American documentarian, film director, screenwriter and producer.By the time she was brought in to work on the 1993 film Sommersby, she had become known for a particular style of writing in Hollywood.[5] She commented in an interview with Salon.com:[5]I think people know that there's no point in calling me in if you want the other kind of women characters: a featureless \"help me\" character, or the saint, the whore — you know, any of the archetypes. I don't think all women are powerful, intelligent, any of those things. I just require that female characters be very real, that they have all the dimensions that the male characters do.Since then, she has been primarily a screenwriter for such films as Dancers (1987); Impromptu (1991), the debut film directed by her husband James Lapine with a script she characterized as \"maybe the best thing that I will ever do\";[5] Sommersby (1993); wrote and directed The Hairy Bird (1998);[6] co-wrote the story for What Lies Beneath (2000); and directed Thoth (2002) and wrote Learning to Drive (2014).Her second documentary, Thoth, also won an Academy Award in 2002, this time for Best Documentary Short Subject.In June 2011, Kernochan released her first novel in over 35 years entitled Jane Was Here (ISBN 0980037727). A mysterious young woman, calling herself Jane, arrives in the small rundown community of Graynier, Massachusetts. She can point out the house where she grew up, though she has never been to Graynier in her life. Jane carries with her the fragmentary memory of her former life, and refuses to adjust to her new identity. Thus begins Jane's mission, to retrieve the puzzle pieces of a former life, groping her way through the past and the present simultaneously.Kernochan released her third album as a singer-songwriter, \"Decades of Demos,\" in 2013.",
