He began directing 2nd Unit on the American TV show 'Hercules' in '93, which led to an extended period of work with Pacific Renaissance Pictures. This lead to directing main unit on 32 episodes of the above shows, along with 'Young Hercules' and 'Jack of All Trades'.Since then he has been busy directing a mixture of NZ and US television shows, such as 'Power Rangers', 'Almighty Johnsons' and 'The Cult'. A few telemovies - 'Fearless' and 'Lawless', while along the way directing 2nd Unit on American features including '30 Days of Night' and 'The Warriors Way'.More recently he has worked on projects with strong NZ stories that rely on compelling performances. These include the telemovie, 'Tangiwai - A Love Story', which was nominated for best director at the Monte Carlo TV Festival. Also another TV movie, 'Pirates of the Airwaves', a docudrama about pirate radio in 1960's NZ.He has just finished 3 seasons of the Starz network show 'Ash vs Evil Dead', with the dual role of 2nd Unit Director/Associate Producer.Looking to the future Charlie is passionate about discovering and/or developing projects that have a central kiwi component, with inherently global themes, that possess an ability to travel.He is settled in Golden Bay, New Zealand, with family, animals, and a sprawling hillside of his favourite trees.",
