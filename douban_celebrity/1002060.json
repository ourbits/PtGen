    "introduction": "Kathy Acker (April 18, 1947 [disputed] - November 30, 1997) was an American experimental novelist, playwright, essayist, and postmodernist writer, known for her idiosyncratic and transgressive writing that dealt with themes such as childhood trauma, sexuality and rebellion. Her writing incorporates pastiche and the cut-up technique, involving cutting up and scrambling passages and sentences; she also defined her writing as existing in the post-nouveau roman European tradition.",
