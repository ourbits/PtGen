Cine Tela named Brazil, the project is maintained with the cultural support of the CCR System (Road Concession Company), a company that runs several Brazilian concessionaires of highways, including the NovaDutra (which controls the Via Dutra, the main road linking Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro).Inside a truck, Cine Tela Brazil consists of a large tent of 13m x 15m, where 225 seats are installed, equipment, professional 35mm projection (cinemascope) screen of 7m x 3m, stereo surround sound and air conditioning. The entire structure is assembled and disassembled at each visit, being transported by a truck itself, which during the sessions turned into the projection booth. The sessions have lasted for about one hour and 30 minutes, always with the view of a Brazilian film-length. The project promotes four daily sessions of the movies.",
