    "introduction": "Katrin Ottarsdóttir (born 1957) is a Faroese movie director and poet.ContentsBiography\tEditKatrin Ottarsdóttir was born in Tórshavn. While growing up in the Faroes, she did not have television available to her, but enjoyed cinema.[1] She went to Denmark in 1976 and is the first person from the Faroe Islands to study at the film school in Copenhagen, graduating in 1982.[2] In 1989, she received the first prize for a Faroese film at the Nordische Filmtage film festival, for Atlantic Rhapsody.Ottarsdóttir writes her own screenplays and also directs the films. She was both director and producer for Atlantic Rhapsody. Most of the actors in Ottarsdóttir's films are Faroese because the country has a rich theater scene, with many skilled actors available. The Faroe Islands, with their unique landscape, feature prominently in her films.The road movie Bye Bye Bluebird received top honors in 1999 at Nordische Filmtage and the Tiger Award in 2000 at the International Film Festival Rotterdam. Her daughter Hildigunn Eyðfinnsdóttir (born 1975) took the leading role.Since 2007 Katrin Ottarsdóttir has been working on a trilogy of film portraits of Faroese artists. The first of the films, No One Can Achieve Perfection, about the sculptor Hans Pauli Olsen, premiered in January 2008. The second film – A Line A Day Must Be Enough! – about the poet, painter and performance artist Tóroddur Poulsen – premiered in September 2008. The third film in the trilogy, about the writer Jóanes Nielsen, was premiered at the end of 2009.All three portrait films are \"one-(wo)man, one camera\" productions – directed, shot and edited by the filmmaker herself.In 2011 she published some poems in the Faroese literature magazine Vencil; and in 2012 she published her first collection of poems, written in Faroese, with the title: Eru koparrør í himmiríki?' (Are there copper tubings in Heaven?)",
