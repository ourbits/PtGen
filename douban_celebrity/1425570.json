    "introduction": "Karine Andolenko is only 28 years old, and she has already played many bright roles in the cinema. A young and ambitious actress is offered only the main roles. A beautiful blonde attracts fans of different ages, and she wants to know everything about her. What helped the young star to become so successful - ties, heredity, character, talent, or maybe the support of a beloved husband? The actress was born in September 1987 in Kharkov. Mother, half-Tartar, first called the girl Fatima, but because of superstition she changed her mind - this name was worn by a relative with a tragic fate. Karina's mother is a sign language interpreter with a great sense of humor, her father is a big merry fellow and a joker. Karina believes that all the talents of the family are concentrated in her, so she became an actress. The teachers of the Kharkiv theater studio instilled love for acting skills. It was there in 11 years Andolenko came to \"defeat the fear of the public.\" The actress still does not understand how a modest little girl could come up with a way to get rid of complexes. The theater studio became her second home. And the parents, seeing a serious hobby for their daughter, dreamed that once Karina would go on the stage of the Moscow Art Theater. Dreamed of this and the girl herself. Ah, Moscow promised, what a girl does not dream to walk through your noisy squares and streets with a proud winner!In contrast to her heroine Catherine Panova (from the film \"The Queen of Beauty\") Karina Andolenko came to conquer Moscow not alone. She was with her mother, who helped her in everything, and a great faith that she would succeed. Without a favorite business, the future star did not represent herself. Karina easily entered the theater institute, and her student years became happy for her. Favorite profession, friendly course, teachers' praise, bright prospects. The difficulties did not frighten the beginning actress. Karine liked to develop and overcome herself. Ease in any business - it's boring, the actress is interesting the way!",
