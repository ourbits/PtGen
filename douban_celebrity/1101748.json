    "introduction": "Einar Hanson was a contemporary of the more famous Lars Hanson but they were not related. Both went to Hollywood, but while Lars starred in a handful of films and could return home for further successes, Einar’s career ended tragically in California after a promising beginning. It started however in Sweden where his breakthrough came with Gunnar Hedes saga (Mauritz Stiller, 1923), the first of five starring roles over a two-year period. After this he acted in Danish and German films before arriving in America in 1925. In Hollywood he managed to appear in eight features – acting alongside stars such as Anna Q. Nilsson, Clara Bow, Gary Cooper and Pola Negri – before dying at the age of 27 in a car accident in 1927, the year the sound film was born.",
