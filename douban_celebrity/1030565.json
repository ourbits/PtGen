    "introduction": "Born in Boonville, Missouri, in 1869, her family arrived a year later in Los Angeles. Her father was a dentist. Her mother died in 1876, when Julia was seven years old. Julia's sister, Grace, died at age 14.[2] Ivers watched the film industry come into existence and establish itself in southern California. She participated in the new industry as writer, producer and director.She and her husband, Franklin S. Van Trees (aka Frank Van Trees 1866-1914), a famed \"society\" architect best known for his mansions in the Pacific Heights area of San Francisco, had a son, James Van Trees (1890–1973), who became a popular cinematographer for Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. and shot some of his mother's films. Ivers later worked with director William Desmond Taylor and was reportedly a part of his inner circle before his murder. Her extremely wealthy second husband was Oliver Ivers (who died in 1902, two years after their marriage).[1]Death\tEditJulia Crawford Ivers died in Los Angeles in 1930, aged 60, from stomach cancer.",
