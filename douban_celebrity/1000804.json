    "introduction": "Robinson only screen appearance was in Tod Browning's Freaks (1932) as a circus performer who is overjoyed as he celebrates the fact that his wife, the Bearded Lady (Olga Roderick) has just given birth to their child, who is also bearded. By all accounts, his character in the film, the chatty, good-natured fellow who plays poker in the back of the tent and celebrates his baby's birth with a round of fine cigars, was not much of a stretch for Pete. He was a jovial man who loved to stubbornly argue about politics, and was rumored to be a classically trained Shakespearian actor and an expert harmonica player.Peter Robinson died in 1947 at the age of 72.",
