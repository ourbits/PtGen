    "introduction": "Pankaj Tripathi is a well-known Indian actor who has made a significant contribution to Indian cinema. Born to Pandit Benares Tiwari, a priest and Hemanti Devi, Tripathi had a humble upbringing in a small town in Bihar, India.Tripathi, as a child, participated in a few amateur plays where he played the role of a girl. However, he was not actively involved in the world of acting at that time. While studying in class 12, Tripathi's interest in theatre was sparked when he watched a play named Andha Kuan. Actor Pranita Jaiswal's emotional performance moved him to tears, which further intensified his passion for theatre. Later on, Tripathi relocated to Patna to pursue Higher education in Hotel management training and this is where his life took a new direction.He would often cycle his way to see all the stage shows that were held in Patna from 1994 - 1995. By 1996, Tripathi stopped being in the audience and took to becoming a performer. Tripathi also worked the night shift in a hotel kitchen during this time.His interest in acting led him to complete his graduation in Hindi literature and enrol at the National School of Drama (NSD) in Delhi, which he completed in 2004. He then moved to Mumbai.",
