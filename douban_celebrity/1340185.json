    "introduction": "Born in Decatur, Alabama to Robert & Rebecca Howard, John-Paul is the younger brother to a very athletic sister Jessica Howard. He has always been a happy child and loves to read and learn new things. His career started at the age of seven when he auditioned for Snow White and the Seven Dwarves in Huntsville AL. He instantly got the role of \"Opie\". Instead of hanging out with the other kids at show time he was found at his mark waiting for the curtain to open. After that he was asked if he wanted to audition for professional roles. He finally got noticed by Bryan Michael Stoller for his indie film First Dog. John-Paul is a very kindhearted sentimental individual. He enjoys the entertainment industry and has great respect for it.",
