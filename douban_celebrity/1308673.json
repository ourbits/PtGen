    "introduction": "At the age of 13, Tadhg Murphy, a chatty, funny Dubliner, lost an eye in an accident. “I decided right then I wanted to be the lead singer in a band or an actor,” he says. Tadhg says his group were “brutal”, but he proved to have a knack for the acting. Following a spell in Trinity College Dublin, he secured regular roles on Black Sails and Vikings.In 2017, he kicks up another gear with two exciting new TV series. In Will, a study of Shakespeare’s early life, he plays a rival to the title character.We will also see him as an IRA man in John Ridley’s Guerrilla for Sky Atlantic. Ridley, who won an Oscar for writing 12 Years a Slave, first met Murphy when he was casting the Jimi Hendrix biopic Jimi: All Is By My Side. “He said then, ‘I’d like to give you a part, but you’re too nice’,” Murphy says. “Nobody has ever said that about me. Ha-ha!”http://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/people/50-people-to-watch-in-2017-1.2926565",
