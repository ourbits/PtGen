    "introduction": "Terje Rypdal (born 1947) is a Norwegian guitarist and composer. The distorted guitar tone he favors, frequently embellished with his use of volume swells, has more in common with rock music than with the cleaner sounds associated with jazz guitarists. Today, Rypdal is an important member of the Norwegian jazz community. His collaborations as guitarist and composer with other ECM artists Ketil Bj&oslashrnstad and David Darling in 90s are also noteworthy. In those compositions he found a way out of jazz and classical compositions to a modern and more avant-garde unique style.",
