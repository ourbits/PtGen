    "introduction": "Known only by his first name, Ravel is one of the shining lights of the contemporary music scene of the Dominican Republic. Raised in New York, since early childhood, Ravel has remained devoted to the dance music of his homeland. Together with his band Los Bravos, Ravel has made his presence felt since the mid-'90s. His first two albums, Como Tu Lo Quieras and Llego El Tipo, were released on his own label. Llego El Tipo was so successful that it earned two Estrellas del Mernegues awards for \"most popular orchestra\" and \"most distinquished artist.\" Ravel's first major label-distributed album, Alma, Ritmo Y Pueblo, was released by RMM in 1997.",
