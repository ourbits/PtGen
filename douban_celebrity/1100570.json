    "introduction": "Dennis Grabosch (born 2 March 1978, Wedel, Germany) is a German actor.Grabosch has had a long career in movies and television, beginning at the young age of 13, when he won Tele 5's screenplay competition with his short story Der erste Kuß (The First Kiss). Over the next years he wrote and directed for theatre and short films, including the screenplay for Katja Studt's movie Sechshundertzweiunddreißig. As an actor, he has appeared in many television and film productions such as Ein Fall für zwei, Tatort: Einmal täglich, Tatort: Der Traum von der Au, Drei mit Herz, Kommissar Rex and Doppelter Einsatz, to name but a few.He is perhaps best known for his portrayal of Roman Wild in the German daily soap opera Alles was zählt. One of the original AWZ cast members, he was on the show from its beginning in September 2006 until September 2011. Although he played a professional figure skater, Grabosch did not know how to ice skate before being cast in this role. He was substantially involved in creating, in cooperation with AWZ's writers, the reunion storyline of the popular pairing known as Dero.In 2009, Dennis illustrated the cover of Kiki Kufenflitzer – Der Eiskristall, a children's book written by Tanja Szewczenko, his former co-star on AWZ. Tanja's book is based on a caricature of a young girl he originally drew for her birthday, and was further developed for the book's cover and promotional illustrations.Like the character he played on Alles was zählt, Grabosch is openly gay. In 2007, he married Brent Magee, a psychologist; they live in London. In February 2008, he accepted Blu Magazine's Best National TV Format award, along with co-star Igor Dolgatschew, for AWZ's portrayal of the relationship between their characters.",
