    "introduction": "Christiann was born in Mexico, she lived there until the age of ten and then moved to the United States with her family. Soon after she moved to the San Francisco Bay Area, Christiann found out two things: that she loved Hip Hop (specifically 2Pac) and being on stage made sense of a lot of childhood hamminess (not sure this is a word).Ms. Castellanos started her Los Angeles journey in the most original way possible: working as a waitress (at a piano bar in Universal Studios). Once she tired of this, she took up pretending to be a princess at childrens parties and actually got paid to do so.Christiann has studied and performed at Upright Citizen's Brigade and Groundlings, she is currently performing with her all-female sketch group, Awkward Kids.",
