    "introduction": "Growing up in Edmonds, Washington, a life in Hollywood seemed far off, but after Brett Davern began performing in local theatre as a young boy, he knew acting was his calling. While in high school, Brett earned a scholarship to \"Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center,\" one of the most exclusive summer camps for the performing arts, located in upstate New York. This program features an eclectic group of alumni including Oscar nominees Robert Downey, Jr. and Natalie Portman, Emmy-winner Jon Cryer, as well as stage and screen actress Bryce Dallas Howard. Davern continued to hone his craft in college, studying theatre at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy (AMDA) in New York City.Soon after graduating AMDA, Brett landed the sought after role of \"William Messerman\" in Chad Lowe's directorial debut, Beautiful Ohio, in which he had the opportunity to work with seasoned actors such as Oscar-winner William Hurt, Emmy-winner Julianna Margulies and Rita Wilson.Since arriving to Los Angeles, Davern has quietly amassed a body of work that encompasses both television and film. Most recently, he wrapped the independent feature Junk, set to hit the festival circuit in the near future. Brett also starred opposite Mathew Lillard and Rachelle Lefevre in the coming-of-age comedy Pool Boys, and played the introverted \"Whisper\" in the feature film Triple Dog opposite Brittany Robertson and Scout Taylor Compton. His television credits include popular television dramas such as CSI: Miami, In Plain Sight, Medium, and Cold Case, in which he played Kathryn Morris's younger, troubled brother in the recurring role of \"Finn.\"Along with his daily workout regiment, Brett Davern is an avid snowboarder, wake boarder and enjoys playing soccer, football, and baseball. Davern currently resides in Los Angeles.",
