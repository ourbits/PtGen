    "introduction": "Pádraig was born in Dublin. He began acting in the vibrant theatre scene that was emerging there in the late 80's and early nineties. This coincided with a resurgence in Irish film and saw him play the lead role in 'The Courier' alongside Gabriel Byrne and taking roles in movies such as 'Taffin', a star vehicle for Pearse Brosnan. In his early twenties, he moved to London to study acting at The Drama Centre and, inspired by the opportunity the city offers to create independent theatre and film. He has been based there ever since and continues to work in both mediums. Recent production includes the highly regarded 'A View From The Bridge' with Mark Strong which was broadcast from the West End to theatres around the world via NT Live and a host of independent feature films and shorts direct and produced by a new generation of filmmakers.",
