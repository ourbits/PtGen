    "introduction": "Frank Joseph Perry Jr.[1] (August 21, 1930 – August 29, 1995) was an American stage director and filmmaker. The 1962 independent film David and Lisa was nominated for two Academy Awards for best director (Frank Perry) and best screenplay (written by his then-wife, Eleanor Perry). The couple would go on to collaborate on five more films including the cult classic The Swimmer starring Burt Lancaster, Diary of a Mad Housewife starring Carrie Snodgress, and the Emmy Award–nominated A Christmas Memory, which was based on a short story by Truman Capote and also adapted by his wife Eleanor. Perry went on to form Corsair Pictures, which was privately financed by United Artists Theatres, producing two film flops, Miss Firecracker and A Shock to the System, before folding.[2][3] His later films include the Razzie Award–nominee Joan Crawford bio drama Mommie Dearest and the documentary On the Bridge, about his battle with prostate cancer. Author Justin Bozung, who has been researching the filmmaker's life since 2013, is currently writing the official biography of Frank Perry titled Character Is Story: The Life & Films of Frank Perry. The book is due out in 2020.",
