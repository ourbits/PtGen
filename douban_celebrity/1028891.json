    "introduction": "Martin Šulík (born in 1962 in Žilina, Slovakia) is the son of actor Anton Šulík. He studied film and television direction at the Academy of Performing Arts (VŠMU) in Bratislava (1981-1986) from which he graduated by his film Staccato (1986) awarded at a number of festivals. During his studies, he made several short films based on his own stories and screenplays. Between 1986–1991, he worked as assistant director in the short film studio, occasionally taking up theatre direction as well (Brecht’s Mr. Puntilla and His Man Matti and Witkiewicz’s Mother), acted in films and made documentary films. From the beginning of the 1990s, he made primarily feature-length feature films, characteristic for their poetic, symbolical tone, nostalgic atmosphere, existential dimension and episodic structure. The majority of these were made in cooperation with his permanent creative team (script writers Ondřej Šulaj and Marek Leščák, cameraman Martin Štrba, designer František Lipták and composer Vladimír Godár). Most of his films were awarded at numerous festivals, mainly Záhrada/ The Garden (Czech Lion Awards for the best film, direction and screenplay; Audience Award at the Mannheim IFF, Grand Prix at the Cottbus Film Festival; Special Jury Mention, FIPRESCI AWARD and Ecumenical Jury Award at the Karlovy Vary IFF). His filmmaking and opinion is recorded in the profile anthology Svet v pohyblivých obrazoch Martina Šulíka/ The World in the Moving Pictures of Martin Šulík (Bratislava, SFÚ 2000). Further on, 5 screenplays were published in book form (Bratislava, FSÚ 2003) and in 2001, a soundtrack from his films was issued on CD. Martin Šulík is the head of the Department of Film and Television Direction at VŠMU; he receives invitations to discussions with students of other film schools, workshops, festivals and similar events.Filmography:Dvor/ The Courtyard (Czechoslovakia, 1984)Sko Pala Rocku/ The Death of Palo Rocka (55´, Czechoslovakia, 1985)Staccato (40´, Czechoslovakia, 1986)Postoj/ The Position (90´, Czechoslovakia, 1989)Všetko, čo mám rad/ Everything I like (90´,Czechoslovakia, 1992)Neha/ The Tenderness (110´, Czechoslovakia, 1992)Don Quijote z Krivian (SK, 1993)Záhrada/ The Garden (99´, SK/France, 1995)Súkromný skanzen (SK, 1996)Orbis Pictus (105´, SK, 1997)Praha očima – segment Pictures from a Visit (101´, CZ/France/Netherlandes, 1999)Krajinka/ Landscape (111´, CZ/SK, 2000)Klíč k určování trpaslíků aneb Poslední cesta Lemuela Gullivera/ The Key for Determining Dwarfs or The Last Travel of Lemuel Gulliver (58´, CZ, 2002)Visions of Europe – povídka Zázrak (140´, Europe, 2004)Sluneční stát aneb Hrdinové dělnické třídy/ Working Class Heroes (95´, CZ/SK, 2005)Martin Slivka – muž, ktorý sadil stromy (90´, SK, 2007)",
