    "introduction": "About Colin: “Born in 1985 in Connecticut, Colin Theys is an award-winning director and visual effects artist. His effects knowledge allows him to shoot with post-production in mind, delivering big production value on small budgets.Raised on a diet of classic movies and computers, he studied animation, acting, and the visual arts. He majored in film studies at Wesleyan University and went on to direct his first commercial feature, Banshee!!! only two months after graduation.Colin has been directing features and supervising visual effects for Synthetic Cinema International, most recently taking on Steve Niles’ Remains, the first original film for NBCUniversal’s Chiller Network. His next feature, Dead Souls, is a supernatural thriller based on the novel by Michael Laimo.A technical geek at heart, Colin loves both science fiction and the science behind it. He believes that a good director should know what everyone on set does and how they do it.”",
