    "introduction": "Rob Harris grew up in Chattaroy, West Virginia and is now a Nashville-based actor and musician. He was bitten by the performance bug at the age of six when he participated in a first-grade skit based on the TV show The Big Valley (1965).Rob played Lee Majors' character Heath Barkley and after a brief Rockettes-style dance scene, he uttered his one line: \"Those girls sure can kick!\" When the line got a laugh from the audience, Rob was hooked.After graduating from Williamson High School, he attended Marshall University (Huntington, WV) where he studied Radio/TV Broadcasting and Theater. During his first semester he was cast as Rosencrantz in Tom Stoppard's \"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.\" He continued to appear in stage productions and community theater throughout his time at Marshall (Wait Until Dark, I'm Getting My Act Together, The Spiral Staircase, Foxfire and Dracula). After completing his degree, he pursued further education at Kentucky Christian University (Grayson, KY) where he remained active in stage plays and musical theater (Camelot, Barefoot In the Park, Ten Little Indians and Arsenic and Old Lace) while studying ministry.A performing Singer/Songwriter, Rob has opened shows for Grammy® Award-winning and Dove Award-winning artists, plays house concerts and is a frequent performer at Nashville-area songwriter venues such as Puckett's Grocery and the world famous, Bluebird Café.",
