During his years in Paris, he was nicknamed Tum-te-tum. His friend Pat Conroy observed that Walter had lived a \"pixilated wonderland of a life.\" Walter was labeled \"Mobile's Renaissance Man\" because of his diverse activities in many areas of the arts. In later life, he maintained a connection with Mobile by carrying a shoebox of Alabama red clay around Europe.",
