Burt brings to his material a diverse background ranging from serving in the US Peace Corps, volunteering at a county Emergency Room, interning with the Fish & Wildlife service, living on four continents, writing the highly copied password change email logic at Amazon, taking the MCATs, riding a motorcycle, and raising an amazing child. This depth of experience comes through in his roles.His first lead role in a feature film was in To Survive (2014). In preparation for the role, Burt walked solo across Illinois prior to the beginning of the film as his character did prior to the beginning of the story. He doesn't approach all roles through the method acting but it's a powerful tool in his toolbox.",
