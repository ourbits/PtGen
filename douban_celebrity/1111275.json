    "introduction": "Wassily Kandinsky was one of the most original and influential artists of the twentieth-century. His \"inner necessity\" to express his emotional perceptions led to the development of an abstract style of painting that was based on the non-representational properties of color and form. Kandinsky's compositions were the culmination of his efforts to create a \"pure painting\" that would provide the same emotional power as a musical composition. The exhibition \"Kandinsky: Compositions\", organized by Magdalena Dabrowski and on display at the Los Angeles County Art Museum until September 3, 1995, presents these monumental works together for the first and possibly last time and provides an opportunity to witness the creative process of Kandinsky.",
