    "introduction": "Born in Los Angeles, California, Tyler attended UCLA and Harvard University. He was a member of The Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity at UCLA, as part of the Epsilon Pledge Class. His musical career began at an early age, after being inspired by his Academy Award winning art director grandfather, Walter H. Tyler. He traveled to United States and Russia, performing at concerts with his own written and composed pieces. After a couple of years, Tyler began playing for orchestras, ensembles, choirs, using instruments, such as piano, classical percussion, guitar, bass, bouzouki, mandolin, keyboards, and drums.[1] Tyler was also featured in a number of rock bands and with artists, such as Elton John and Slash.",
