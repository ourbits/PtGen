    "introduction": "John Fasano was born on August 24 1961. A native New Yorker he graduated from the State University of New York at Purchase in 1964 and worked as an art director for specialized interest magazines, as well as designing posters for exploitation movies. His work in this field sufficiently impressed producer Jack Bravman, who hired him to helm the low budget horror picture 'Zombie Nightmare', starring Adam West. Since then, his career has largely been associated with that particular genre but he has also written for more mainstream films, such as 'Alien3' and 'Another 24 Hours', in addition to work on popular television series.",
