    "introduction": "Comedian, writer and broadcaster, Wil Anderson was the former co-host of Triple J's Breakfast show, one of Australia's few truly national brekkie radio gigs and former host of ABC-TVs cult hit 'The Glass House'. However, he is probably still best known as one of Australia's greatest live stand-up comedians, selling out theatres across the country. His ease on stage is a disarming front for intelligent material that ranges from personal to pop to politics. He has also performed at the Melbourne Comedy Festival and the Adelaide Fringe Festival, and in 1999 was nominated for the Perrier Best Newcomer Award at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, returning since to much critical acclaim. Wil writes the Sunday Roast column for the Sunday Magazine (Sunday Telegraph). He has also been a columnist for The Australian, Melbourne Extra (1998-99) and The Big Issue (1997), and is one of Australia's most accomplished corporate performers. He currently hosts the successful Wil + Lehmo show on Triple M.",
