    "introduction": "Jesse had a wild ride, literally, into his successful career as a musician and comedic actor. Jesse is a southern gospel and bluegrass musician, but got his biggest break, believe it or not, being a bus driver for the entertainers. His stint with the Steep Canyon Rangers lead him to being associated with Steve Martin. Jesse seized the opportunity given to him to be an on stage performer with Steve Martin and Martin Short's nightly variety shows and ran with it, as well as being involved in their TV productions. Jesse has branched out into acting for television and movies, but will keep driving the bus until Steve Martin retires.",
