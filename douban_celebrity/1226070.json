    "introduction": "Overview (3)Born\tJanuary 21, 1969 in La Mirada, California, USABirth Name\tMatthew Joseph WilligHeight\t6' 7\" (2.01 m)Mini Bio (1)Matthew retired from the NFL after 14 seasons. He played for 6 teams (New York Jets, Atlanta Falcons, Green Bay Packers, St. Louis Rams, San Francisco 49ers and the Carolina Panthers). He went to 2 Super Bowls, winning 1 and losing the other. He is steadily rising up the acting ladder and receiving acclaim as his roles get bigger and better.- IMDb Mini Biography By: Nolan NorthTrivia (1)Matthew Willig and Junior Seau were suite-mates and good friends at USC.Personal Quotes (4)I grew up knowing I would be good at athletics, and dreams of a Super Bowl were always within reach as long as I progressed.It's funny, because athletes want to be rockers and vice-versa.When I was at USC, I did a movie with somebody, and I had a blast doing it.The longer and longer I played in the NFL, I kind of said, \"Well, I'm not going to go out and get a 9-to-5 job at any point soon, so what can I do?\" So I started hosting radio and TV shows while I was still playing.",
