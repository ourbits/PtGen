    "introduction": "A man named Neil Thomas Ward wrote online \"In Search of a Lost Film\", published on March 5th 2018 in 'Medium', and claims in it that C.S. Leigh died in early 2016. He doesn't present any hard proof, only a very elaborate story about his decade-long search for Process (2004), which is out of distribution, and his strange friendship with Leigh. In spite of some Wikipedia sites using Ward's claim as factual truth, neither a proof nor an official statement exists, that he really died in London, England, UK, in 2016. Since Leigh owes many people large sums of money, it might be simply a new strategy to escape his creditors by using disinformation and a new facade.Since C.S. Leigh is notoriously unreliable and some of his films have not been completed or have no distribution or might not even exist, his biography and filmography should be handled with caution [see: \"A True Rip-Off Artist\", Vice, Dec.2013].",
