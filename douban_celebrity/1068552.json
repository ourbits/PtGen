    "introduction": "Mike Bruner grew up in Nebraska. His graduating high school class consisted of 24 students. That was where he began acting as part of the high school talent show; he was in the 2nd grade. He was in the high school drama club all 4 years, frequently winning Best Actor Awards. But growing up in a small town did not stop him from dreaming big. As the years went by he kept his dream of acting professionally and was signed as a professional actor while working in Arizona. He moved to Los Angeles in 2001 when he was signed by his manager, the Late Gary Shaffer, a long time Casting Director. One of his first on screen credits was selected for screening at The Sundance Film Festival. Mike has had guest-starring roles on such hit shows as The Shield, C.S.I.: Crime Scene Investigation, and a recurring role on The Office. Mike has also worked with the likes of Fran Drescher, David Faustino, and Gilbert Gottfried. Mike continues to live in the Los Angeles area and is professionally represented for both Theatrical and Commercial work.",
