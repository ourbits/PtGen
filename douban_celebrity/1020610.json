    "introduction": "Emanuele Luzzati (3 June 1921 - 26 January 2007) was an Italian painter, production designer, illustrator, film director and animator. He was nominated for Academy Awards for two of his short films, La gazza ladra (The Thieving Magpie) (1965) and Pulcinella (1973).He was born in Genoa and turned to drawing in 1938 when, as a Jew, his academic studies were interrupted by the introduction of the Fascist racial laws. He moved in Switzerland with his family and studied in Lausanne. He designed his first production of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba in 1944, a collaboration with his friends Alessandro Fersen, Aldo Trionfo and Guido Lopez. He returned in Italy after the war.His first work as an animator was the short film I paladini di Francia, together with Giulio Giannini, in 1960.He provided the designs for several Glyndebourne opera productions, among them several Mozart productions and Verdi's Macbeth produced by Michael Hadjimischev.Luzzati was interested in tarot symbolism, which he used in scenographies for Fabrizio de André concerts.",
