    "introduction": "Emily Wardill, born 1977 in the United Kingdom, lives and works in Lisbon, Portugal and Malmo, Sweden. Her films, photographs and objects probe the complexity of perception and communication, the question of how reality appears authentic to us, and the displacements of substance and form effected by the individual nature of the imagination. The films that she started making in the mid-2000s are typically defined by a narrative framework, but the plots as such tend to be secondary. The focus is on other aspects: the mechanics of storytelling, the relationship of imaginary space to language and the interplay between gesture and word. Wardill’s work has been exhibited in museums, art spaces and biennials internationally. Currently, Wardill works as a Professor at Malmo Art Academy, Sweden and as a visiting tutor at Maumaus, School of Visual Arts, in Lisbon.",
