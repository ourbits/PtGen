    "introduction": "Brenda McCullough is a television, film, commercial, industrial actress, as well as a voice over artist. She can be seen in HBO's upcoming third season of \"The Gilded Age\" and Netflix's upcoming second season of \"Survival Of the Thickest\".Born and raised in \"The Nation's Playground\", Atlantic City, Brenda is a proud graduate of New York University and Chicago-Kent School of Law. After working in the Cook County States Attorney's Office and administering cable franchises under the auspices of the County's Planning Department, Brenda served as Assistant, and then, General Manager for a Time Warner Cable television system in Bucks County, PA. She utilized her fifteen years of cable experience to manage the operational activities of all departments in the 43,000 customer system and successfully guided the system through three successive corporate ownership transfers. As a result of restructuring due to the acquisition of the cable system by Comcast, hundreds of positions were affected, including hers. This afforded her the golden opportunity to explore both on-camera commercial and industrial acting, as well as voice over acting. Since shortly after 9/11, Brenda has been fortunate enough to book jobs for episodic television, independent film, industrials, infomercials, commercials, print, narration and radio spots.",
