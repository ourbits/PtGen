    "introduction": "2009, Christian Neuman founded the London brand Belle Sauvage with Ferreira, as well as making a number of promotional films together, including the interesting work Self Similarity (2012) which shows women draped in futurist textiles, both flashy and gothic in colour. In short, when it comes to Neuman, any opportunity is as good as another for exploring a punk, anti-conformist aesthetic, and Skin Walker is certainly no exception to this.",
