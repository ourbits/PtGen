    "introduction": "Billy started acting at the age of 4 months. He did over 40 national commercials before the age of 10. At the age of 16 months he booked the recurring role of Cabot Sinclair on As the World Turns. Over the years Billy has booked roles on various TV shows and feature films, including the role of Jessica Jones younger brother Philip Jones in Jessica Jones on Netflix.Billy has lots of fun playing deadpan characters with psychopathic tendencies. He also love playing confident characters who know where they stand in life and are happy with it-people who better themselves but never forget where they came from, and never compromise who they really are.He believes in not dwelling on present pain; whatever you're feeling right now will be gone eventually.Billy wants people to see him as a normal person who makes the choice to put the effort into doing what he wants to do and becomes a stronger version of himself-someone that they can realistically be. Not someone to look up to.",
