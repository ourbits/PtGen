    "introduction": "Drew Ray Tanner was born on February 12th, 1992 in Victoria, B.C. He is an actor known for Riverdale (2017) tt5420376  , Somewhere Between (2017) and You Me Her (2016) Drew's love for performing was born on his Grandparents living room floor at the age of 5. His Grandfather, a retired Canadian Soldier would perform magic tricks to the wonderment of his grandchildren, particularly Drew. He then started practicing on his own, and soon enough the two of them (Drew as his sidekick) would put on shows for the family. Seeing the looks of amazement on their faces, it ignited a lifelong passion in him. Drew then went on to perform in local Theatre plays. He joined an Improv Troupe at 14 and in his Senior year, he auditioned for the Spring Feature, landing the leading role. The show ran for 4 weeks, and by the final night, Drew had decided this was something he wanted to pursue. That summer he began auditioning for TV and Film and on the day before his 19th Birthday he booked his first part in R.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour (2010) Before and during his acting career Drew had many jobs, supporting himself with an arrangement of work like retreading tires, bar tending, selling cars, and even at one time a chainsaw builder.",
