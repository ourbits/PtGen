    "introduction": "Starting as a child actor in the 70s, Michael graduated to become a musician with a handful of albums in the glam-rock 80s. During this time he directed several music videos and commercials and sold a handful of scripts that later became feature films. Michael briefly disappeared from entertainment and into the dot-com world where he created a successful website company responsible for putting such companies as Mitsubishi and UCLA online. He later sold the business, went to law school, and came crashing back into entertainment by forming Silver Wings Productions (\"Critical Mass\" and \"This Island Earth...\") and later becoming the head of business affairs for Harvey Entertainment (\"Casper, the Friendly Ghost\" and \"Richie Rich\"), as well as production work for Universal, Paramount Classics, and Disney. He is a founding partner in Black Sky Entertainment which produced \"Cabin Fever\" and is in production on it's next, entitled \"Site Unseen\". Michael also owns his own production banner that has produced the \"Climb On!\" extreme sports series, and is currently directing \"TechnoSmog\" (release date December 2003) as well as producing several features, including \"Blind Man's Bluff\" (Sundance Film Festival short) and \"Billy Whiteman\" (based on the upcoming novel by Sid Jacobson).",
