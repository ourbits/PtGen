    "introduction": "Louise Weard is a Director and Producer with a degree in Film Semiotics. She began her career by directing the cult classic horror film Computer Hearts and languished in obscurity for a decade before the film became recognized as an important work of trans cinema and the prototype for \"dysphoria horror\" (Bleeding Skull). Her takeover of Fantastic Fest's annual 100 Best Kills event in 2022 launched her into industry focus and in their Sundance 2022 coverage Vulture called Louise \"the future of indie film.\" Her feature length debut Castration Movie is the best film of all time.",
