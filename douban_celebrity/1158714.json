    "introduction": "Stephen Ralph Tredre (17 July, 1963 - 8 December, 1997), was an English actor-writer, who died of bone cancer.The son of a doctor, born in London he was educated at Epsom College, appearing as the lead in a school production of Hamlet, Tredre also wrote articles for the school magazine, edited by his brother. After studying drama and English at Exeter University, he graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.[1]After graduation, he appeared on the stage in Manchester and London, and then in film and television productions, including ITV's The Bill. While on the set of Dark Season, Tredre met actress Kate Winslet, with whom he had a five-year relationship.[2][3] The couple broke up in 1997, at Tredre's insistence.[4]Tredre began to write while still working as an actor. Having had scripts accepted to the BBC soap opera EastEnders, he then joined the soap's rota of writers. His diagnosis with cancer in 1996 didn't diminish his output, and in fact increased it, writing the short personal memoir film Between Dreams, and having his six-part legal series Fish be accepted by the BBC, who cast Paul McGann in the lead role.[1]Tredre finished an EastEnders script from his bed in his home in Islington two weeks before his death from bone cancer, dying soon after Winslet completed filming Titanic. Attending his funeral caused her to miss the film's premiere in Los Angeles.[3]",
