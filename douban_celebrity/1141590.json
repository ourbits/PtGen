    "introduction": "Gerald ScarfeGerald Anthony Scarfe (born in London on June 1 1936) is a British cartoonist and illustrator whose work is characterised by an apparent obsession with the grotesque and diseased, perhaps a result of an asthmatic, bed-ridden childhood.His early caricatures of public figures were published in satirical magazine Private Eye throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In 1979, he provided the cover illustration for Pink Floyd's The Wall and in 1982 worked on animations for the film version of the album. He also animated the title sequence for the TV series Yes, (Prime) Minister.",
