    "introduction": "Dallas’ vision to be a filmmaker came while being a kid that had to interpret movies through words to his blind mother. The story continues as Dallas embarked on several personal trips circling the world 2 times, and touring 66 countries to date, which sparked his passion as a screenwriter. Dallas' journey continued at the Hollywood Film and Acting Academy (HWFAA), and flourished while working on his Master's in Directing at UCLA Film School.Dallas’ first company venture, ONYX Entertainment, has since expanded to be RED RABBIT PICTURES and takes a special interest in creating Sci-fi, Action, and Fantasy genre projects. Dallas has written, produced, and directed numerous projects including MOST WANTED, LITTLE SOLDIER, and SAVIOR, which have earned Dallas the Motion Picture Association of America Award, the Four Sisters Award for writing, the McNamara Grant for the Arts, The Caucus Foundation Award for Directing, a three-time finalist for the Alfred P. Sloan Award for screenwriting, and a 2012 Directors Guild of America award for \"Outstanding Directorial Achievement\".",
