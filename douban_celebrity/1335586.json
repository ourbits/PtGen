    "introduction": "This Montreal-born actor holds a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) from the Actors Studio Drama School and a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B) from the University of Montreal. He speaks fluent English, French and Vietnamese. Given his natural gift with languages, he has also acted in Cantonese, Mandarin, Nepalese and Tibetan. Before becoming an actor, he once wanted to be an opera singer and eventually studied classical singing for nearly 4 years. His past service in the Canadian Army Reserve as a soldier in the Infantry complements his artistic nature and reflects concurrent aspects of his personality. Although Thai-Hoa considers Quebec and North America to be his base, he has been expanding his market into Asia, having worked as a lead actor both in China and Vietnam. In March 2011, Thai-Hoa performed in the Off-Broadway production of We Are..., for which he was given a thumbs-up by the New York Times for his \"particularly lovely voice and physicality\" and \"nuanced delivery\". In 2010, Thai-Hoa was invited to go back to Vietnam, the land of his ancestors, and join the prestigious cast of Pearls of the Far East by Cuong Ngo (2009 National Film Board (NFB) Award nominee for Best Canadian Short), a groundbreaking art-house movie in Vietnamese cinema. Thai-Hoa has since garnered legions of young fans, as he was seen by millions in the 2013 Vietnamese blockbuster and \"wuxia\" epic Lady Assassin 3D. His popularity both in Canada and Vietnam has increased tenfold since his recent portrayal of General Nhuan opposite Jennifer Lawrence and Peter Dinklage in X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014).",
