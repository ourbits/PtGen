Brian can be seen on NBC, HBO, APPLE TV, and CBS to name just a few.Additionally, Brian has been featured in the independent short films including Ten Shots, The Signs, and 1805, which holds a special place in Brian's heart given his love of American history.In his free time, Brian can be found trying to navigate life as a parent, listening to the same music he loved as a teenager, playing golf, and running around the neighborhood pretending to be Batman.",
