    "introduction": "David Trueba is the youngest of eight siblings. He was born in Madrid in 1966, and studied journalism before working in various communications media. His debut as a screenwriter came with the film 'Amo tu cama rica' (1992), by Emilio Martínez-Lázaro. He then moved to Los Angeles where he studied film at the American Film Institute. On his return to Spain he wrote the screenplay for the hit film 'Los peores años de nuestra vida' (1994), and collaborated –among other films– in the screenplay for 'La niña de tus ojos' (1998), directed by his brother Fernando Trueba. In 1996 he directed his first feature film, 'The good life', which was entered in the Directors' Fortnight at Cannes. Some years later, the Cannes Film Festival was also where he presented his film 'Soldiers of Salamis' (2003), based on the novel by Javier Cercas. In 2002 he co-produced and co-wrote 'Balseros', the first Spanish documentary to be nominated for an Oscar. His film 'Living is easy with your eyes closed' was an outright winner at the Goya awards ceremony in 2014. He combines filmmaking with his journalistic and literary pursuits.",
