    "introduction": "Fareed Abdelhak was born and raised in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. He began taking acting lessons in 1996, and would then experiment with writing soon afterward. In May 1998, Fareed completed his first screenplay, \"Promise.\" While still maintaining his Edmonton residency, Fareed established a new one in the Vancouver area in August 1998. He was part of the first class to complete the Professional Film Studies Program at Capilano College, and immediately began working in the B.C. Film Industry. In June 2000, Fareed signed with Lissa Lloyd of Lloyd Talent Management, and on May 23, 2001, Fareed Abdelhak Productions Inc. was established. In January 2008, Fareed returned to Edmonton and decided to temporarily walk away from acting, including leaving Lloyd Talent, to venture into the new frontier of producing, where in May 2009, he expanded his company to Edmonton as well.",
