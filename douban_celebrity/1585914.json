    "introduction": "Mishael Morgan was born on July 15, in San Fernando, Trinidad. At the age of five, her family emigrated to Toronto, Canada. Mishael caught the acting bug at the age of ten, during her elementary school's production of \"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dream Coat\". She never pursued acting professionally, until a chance meeting with her, now agent, David Ritchie. Mishael studied Political Science at York University, and had just accepted an offer to Ottawa University's LLB program, when Ritchie convinced her, to try her hand at acting. Mishael impressed producers at her very first audition, landing her a role in Trey Songz \"Wonder Woman\" music video. A short ten months, and a couple roles later, Mishael scored her first series-regular role as Tracy Dupont-Roymont in YTV's \"Family Biz\"(2009). Since then, Mishael has continued to make her name known on both the small and big screens. Landing roles on hit television shows like, \"The Best Years\" (2009), \"Republic of Doyle\" (2012), and CW's \"Beauty & The Beast\" (2012). As well as features films like, \"Beat The World\" (2011), \"Casino Jack\" (2010) and \"Total Recall\" (2012). Most recently, Mishael's portrayal of Hilary Curtis on the \"The Young and The Restless\"(2018), landed her, her first Daytime Emmy Nomination.",
