    "introduction": "Harrison Knight was born in Orangeburg, South Carolina and moved shortly thereafter with his mother to Kingstree, South Carolina. He began performing at an early age in theatrical productions at his church. In elementary school, Karl Singletary, an artist-in-residence and former member of the Buffalo City Ballet, selected him to train as a ballet dancer. He added tap dancing to his repertoire at the age of eight and within two years had advanced to the senior tap company.In 2002, Knight and his mother relocated to Atlanta to further hone his performance skills. He continued ballet and tap classes at Ballethnic Dance Company, where he performed in major productions including The Urban Nutcracker and The Leopard Tale. When Atlanta talent agent Joy Pervis signed him as a client, he began adding numerous voiceover and commercial jobs to his resume, which eventually led to another transition.Knight and his mother moved to Los Angeles in 2005 where he was signed by the Osbrink Agency. Since that time he has worked steadily in both film and TV. His credits include guest starring spots in CBS' \"CSI: Miami\" and ABC's \"Grey's Anatomy,\" co-starring stints in ABC's \"Detroit 187,\" Fox's \"Lie to Me\" and TNT's \"Dark Blue\" and commercial and voiceover jobs for Verizon, Home Depot, Best Buy and McDonald's. Additionally, he has worked on looping projects for \"Alvin and the Chipmunks,\" \"The Rookie\" and \"Mean Girls II.\" Knight's first film was Mario Van Peebles' \"We the Party.\"",
