    "introduction": "Often referred to as Die Große Dame des Deutschen Schlagers (roughly, the Greatest Woman of the German Schlagers), Claudia Jung enjoyed a long-lasting run of success in her native Germany, where she rose to fame in the late '80s and recorded a steady stream of successful albums in the decades that followed. She garnered a devoted following over the years, so much so that even once she left her longtime label, EMI, and in turn saw her name fall off the German singles chart for years on end, her albums continued to be well received. Rarely did one of her albums not reach the German Top 40, in fact. She simply didn't need charting hit singles any longer; she had a loyal fan base that supported her efforts year in and year out. Besides winning the devotion of countless fans, Jung also won several presitgious awards, among them the ECHO-Preise (1994, 2000) and Goldene Stimmgabeln (1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 2002). Especially during her mid-'90s prime, few could rival her for the honorary title of Die Große Dame des Deutschen Schlagers.",
