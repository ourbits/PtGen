He also composed numbers for the musicals The Love Racket (1943), Sweet And Low (1944) and Strike It Again (1945).After the war, he directed Agatha Christie stage plays, including The Hollow (1951) and The Mousetrap (for seven years, beginning in 1953).The period was the subject of his 1980 memoir, Agatha Christie and All That Mousetrap.He called Christie \"a mean old bitch\".He presented and performed in numerous radio programmes, including A Square Deal for seven years and Thanks for the Memory for over 30.He also acted in films and on television and wrote light comedies and two novels.",
