    "introduction": "Chavo Guerrero is a 20-year third generation veteran of the professional wrestling industry who first debuted back in 1994 after having been trained by legendary family members Chavo Guerrero Sr., Eddie Guerrero, Hector Guerrero and Mando Guerrero. He started his career working in both Mexico and Japan and had a stint with New Japan Pro Wrestling prior to signing with World Championship Wrestling in 1996. During his 5-years with WCW Guerrero would both feud and team with his real life uncle Eddie Guerrero. He would become a 2-Time WCW Cruiserweight Champion and former 1-Time WCW Tag-Team Champion before the company closed in 2001.Guerrero's contract was one of 25 that were purchased by World Wrestling Entertainment in 2001 during the acquisition of WCW. He ended up spending a decade with the organization becoming one of the company's top cruiser-weight talents during that period and also again formed a popular tag-team with Eddie Guerrero, Named Los Guerreros. Many consider Los Guerrero as one of the best tag teams in the world. Chavo would become a former 4-Time WWE Cruiserweight Champion and also win the tag-team titles twice with Eddie. In 2008 he reached his highest level of singles success when he defeated C.M. Punk in January to win the company's ECW Championship. Guerrero requested and was granted his release from the organization in June of 2011. Chavo then signed with TNA Impact Wrestling where he stayed for a year. In late 2013, he again asked for his release for TNA, this time to pursue other ventures. Chavo is now active in Hollywood on the acting scene and also is endorsing several companies. Chavo has recently become the Celebrity Ambassador to a new company dealing with monetizing social media, which will launch in the up coming months.",
