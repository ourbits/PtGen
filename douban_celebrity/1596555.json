    "introduction": "A veteran of both stage and screen, Christopher was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico and grew up there and in Santa Fe. He has lived throughout the United States and also abroad. He began his acting career at an early age, first setting foot on stage at The Santa Fe Playhouse in the late 1970's. After attending The American Academy of Dramatic Arts West, he spent several years working behind the camera, learning everything he could about the business of production. His experience includes Producer, Director, Assistant Director, Production/Art Designer, Production Coordinator, Property Master, Boom Operator, and of course multiple PA gigs.His passion for acting drew him back in front of the camera and has kept him there ever since. In 2006 he returned to live and work in New Mexico and has appeared in many Film and Television productions including \"Sunshine Cleaning\" and 3 turns on the critically acclaimed AMC series \"Breaking Bad\".Born Christopher Velasquez, he was adopted by his step-father and chose to take his current last name of Dempsey. He has served in the United States Army Reserve as a Combat Medical Specialist and was also a member of the Los Angeles Police Department for almost 5 years. Both provided a wealth of personal and professional experience.",
