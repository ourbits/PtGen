    "introduction": "Rosa von Praunheim (born 25 November 1942) is a German film director, author, painter and one of the most famous gay rights activists in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.[1] In over 50 years, von Praunheim has made more than 150 films (short and feature-length films). His works influenced the development of LGBTQ rights movements worldwide.He began his career associated to the New German Cinema as a senior member of the Berlin school of underground filmmaking. He took the artistic female name Rosa von Praunheim to remind people of the pink triangle that homosexuals had to wear in Nazi concentration camps, as well as the Frankfurt neighborhood of Praunheim where he grew up.[2] A pioneer of Queer Cinema, von Praunheim has been an activist in the gay rights movement.[3] He was an early advocate of AIDS awareness and safer sex, but has been a controversial figure even within the gay community. His films center on gay-related themes and strong female characters, are characterized by excess and employ a campy style. They have featured such personalities as Diamanda Galás, Jayne County, Vaginal Davis, Divine, Jeff Stryker and a row of Warhol superstars.",
