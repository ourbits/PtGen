Black Jr.[4][5][6] It recruited Peter G. Kelly and the firm was renamed Black, Manafort, Stone and Kelly in 1984.[7]:124 During the 1980s, BMSK leveraged its \"White House connections\" to attract \"high-paying clients\" including \"U.S. corporations\", \"trade associations\", and foreign governments. By 1990, it was \"one of the leading lobbyists for American companies and foreign organizations\".[7]:125Stone has variously been referred to in media as a \"political dirty trickster,\" a \"renowned infighter,\" a \"seasoned practitioner of hard-edged politics,\" and a \"veteran Republican strategist.\"[8][9][10][11][12][13] Over the course of his political career, Stone has been widely regarded as promoting a number of falsehoods and conspiracy theories.[22] Stone is the subject of a Netflix documentary film, titled Get Me Roger Stone, which focused on his past and role in the 2016 presidential campaign of Donald Trump.[23] Stone left the Trump campaign on August 8, 2015.",
