His film directorial work started in 1981, and has been focused mostly on urban characters, both impotent and neurotic. Those persona are recurrent characters in his films, or make odd appearances only. Of those people, many have influenced the music score of Sempel's films. Besides music, the films are all marked by a travelogue through the various countries the Director visits to meet his characters.",
