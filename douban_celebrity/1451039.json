    "introduction": "Gerald Kargl born 1953 in Villach, Austria, is a writer and director, famous for the psycho-thriller \"Angst\" (1983). Kargl started experimenting with the film camera when he was 14. This resulted in a large number of short films. Between 1976 and 1982 he founded and organized the Austrian film festival, Die Österreichischen Filmtage. At the same time he was founder and editor of the Austrian film magazine Filmschrift. Between 1984 and 1994 Gerald Kargl worked on more than 100 commercials and promotional films as writer, director and producer, receiving more than 30 national and international awards, Cannes and Clio Awards among others. 1996 he founded and produced the Hotel-TV City Lights and sold the project in 2002. Since 1994 to date he wrote, directed and produced more than 20 documentaries and educational films. \"Angst\" is based on an actual case of triple-murder, the \"Kniesek case\", where Werner Kniesek killed three people in St. Pölten, Austria, out of pure lust in 1980. \"Angst\" is a collaborative effort of writer/director Gerald Kargl and his co-writer-cameraman Zbigniew Rybczynski, and the composer Klaus Schulze, from the \"Krautrock\"-group Tangerine Dream.",
