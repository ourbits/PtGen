    "introduction": "Rosella Towne (January 20, 1918 – August 29, 2014) was an American film actress. She was born in Youngstown, Ohio. Her film career began in 1937, after making a screen test for Warner Bros. and signing a contract for the studio. At first she made minor appearances in motion pictures such as Varsity Show, It's Love I'm After and Submarine D-1. In 1939, she got her first leading role when she was chosen to play the part of comic strip character Jane Arden in a film adaption.[1] While touted by critics as a future star,[2] Towne retired from showbusiness after marrying Harry Kronman, in 1942.[3][4] She died on August 29, 2014, aged 96.[5][6][7] Towne was cremated.[8]",
