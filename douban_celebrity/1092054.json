    "introduction": "Personal Quotes (17)I was lucky not to have been born pretty.I thought I was the wrong shape, that Miss Marple would be much fluffier than me, much more wearing shawls and things. But I was persuaded and now, well - I can only do it my way.[on the death of her husband] I never really got over it, but my work was an enormous help. You simply have to go on.[on her husband] He had no interest in the theatre. I don't think he ever came to see my work. After the show I would get on the train, go home and become Mrs Butler again.

I remember my Aunt Lizzie in tweeds and a flying helmet running up and down the touchline shouting for our boys.I love getting back to Wivenhoe. I get out of my wig, bustle and costume in three minutes flat at the end of the play before jumping into a taxi outside the theater and catching the train home.[on being awarded an OBE] It must be because the programme (Miss Marple) has gone all over the worl",
