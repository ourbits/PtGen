    "introduction": "Shaun Gilmer was born just outside of Atlanta, Georgia and grew up in a small community west of Birmingham, Alabama, with his Paternal Grandmother. Shaun attended a local public school but later went on to graduate from a small private school in east Birmingham with the class of 2003. That fall he attended the University of Alabama at Birmingham in pursuit of a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice and after two semesters decided to take some time off to explore other opportunities. Shaun's passion has always been entertainment, whether it is in the spotlight or behind the scenes. His first real experience with the industry happened when his love for pro-wrestling and entertainment came together in a job with World Wrestling Entertainment and National Broadcasting Company at XFL. There he was an assistant for the Game Operations manager and the Birmingham team. After the league's premature end he became a personal assistant for an independent Christian recording artist that went on to enjoy much regional success. While he has not stepped away from his behind the scene aspirations Shaun has recently stepped in the spotlight and in front of the camera.",
