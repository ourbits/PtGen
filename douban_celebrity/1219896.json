    "introduction": "French-born German citizen Pierre Kiwitt started life as a banker, but soon realized that trading was not in the stars for him. After being discovered by an agent while still behind the till, he decided to step into the deep end. Acting lessons and first part in the cinema and on stage soon followed. Quite accidentally, or so he says, he was cast in a Brazilian telenovela as one of the protagonists. Not speaking a word of Portuguese at the outset, Pierre quickly mastered the language and became a heartthrob in Latin-America, basically overnight. After returning to Europe, where he is still able to walk the streets unrecognized, Pierre continued his successful career with parts in independent films (\"Neben der Spur\"), broadcast television (ratings-hits \"SOKO\" and \"Rosenheim Cops\") and semi-documentaries like \"Stauffenberg - The True Story\", where he played the protagonist's brother, Berthold von Stauffenberg. Pierre resides in Munich and continues to work wherever the work takes him. He speaks five languages.",
