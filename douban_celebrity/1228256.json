    "introduction": "Miranda Mae Gruss was born in New York after which she was swiftly (and unwillingly) relocated to the charming, albeit pint-sized town of Portage, Pennsylvania. Miranda and her identical twin sister Rebecca started acting professionally at 11 years old and quickly moved on from the Pittsburgh film scene to New York, which she should have never left in the first place (thanks a lot Dad).",
