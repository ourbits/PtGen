    "introduction": "Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are American screenwriters and producers. They are known for their work in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, having written the three Captain America films (The First Avenger, The Winter Soldier and Civil War), Thor: The Dark World, Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, and created ABC's Agent Carter TV series. They are also the screenwriters of The Chronicles of Narnia film franchise.[1]Markus grew up in Buffalo, New York.[2]He earned a B.A. in creative writing from Rutgers University in 1991.[3]McFeely grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area.[4]He earned a B.A. in English from the University of Notre Dame in 1991.[5]Both were aspiring novelists when they met in the graduate program for creative writing at the University of California, Davis in 1994.[6]According to Andrew Clark of UC Davis Magazine, \"they quickly came to the conclusion that their novelists' dreams were unrealistic. 'We couldn't see how we could make [book] writing our full-time day job,' McFeely said. Their new goal? Writing for Hollywood.\"[7]After earning their master's degrees in 1996, \"the friends drove to Los Angeles to begin working their way up the entertainment ladder. They each took jobs in the business, including answering phones at production companies. Through networking, they managed to get an agent and ultimately earned their first paying job in 1998, writing a script about a real-life Los Angeles murder. The movie was never made, but the job marked a turning point for Markus and McFeely's screenwriting careers.\"[8]Buzz from the purchased script led HBO Films to commission them to write a biopic of Peter Sellers.[9]For The Life and Death of Peter Sellers in 2004, they won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special.[10]Subsequent work on The Chronicles of Narnia film franchise set them up for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[11]",
