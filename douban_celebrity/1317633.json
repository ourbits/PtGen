    "introduction": "Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Daniel London began acting and writing plays in high school. As a high school student, he had his award-winning play, \"The Martha War\", performed at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. London attended Oberlin College where he continued acting and majored in English and creative writing. He moved to New York City after college graduation to begin his professional career, landing his first major role as Robin Williams's sidekick, Truman Schiff, in Patch Adams (1998). A favorite of Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Beth Henley, London has appeared on stage in two Henley world premiere productions - \"Impossible Marriage\" (playing opposite Holly Hunter) and, in 2006, \"Ridiculous Fraud\". London's work in \"Impossible Marriage\" was seen by Steven Spielberg, who cast him as Wally, the caretaker of the Pre-Cogs, in Minority Report (2002). London has the co-lead role (along with musician Will Oldham) in Kelly Reichardt's award-winning and critically acclaimed film Old Joy (2006). He lives in Brooklyn, New York with his wife, singer/songwriter Megan Reilly.",
