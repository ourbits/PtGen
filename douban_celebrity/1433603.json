    "introduction": "Mark Evans is a British veterinary surgeon turned television presenter.Evan's television career started in 1990 when he complained about an item on TV-am that made fun of fat pets, and was invited as a guest on the show giving advice to the owner of an obese cat.In 1994, Evans was offered a partnership in a large veterinary practice, or to help develop a new animal-rescue based television series with Endemol. Concluding that he could save more animals in three minutes on television than in a life of service as a vet, he developed the format for Pet Rescue on Channel 4, becoming both presenter and an associate producer.Evans has since presented over 1,000 shows, including shows based around pets, gardens, children's television and vehicles. In 2000 he founded Jungle TV, which has since co-produced all of his subsequent productions.",
