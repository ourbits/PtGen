    "introduction": "Gabriel Constantin is a Romanian - British actor. His maternal grandparents were Jewish-Russian and his paternal grandparents were of Greek-Italian ancestry. Early on he was trained in Ballroom dancing during which time he won several competitions nationally and internationally. His passion for acting was rekindled in 2008 when he was cast by Romanian director Nae Caranfil as James Bond in his mock short: \"Drive Another Day\" aimed to promote Transylvania International Film Festival that year. Encouraged by the feedback he decided to finally pursue acting as his career and after attending RADA, he followed it up with the MA acting course at Arts Ed London where he was offered a scholarship and graduated in 2011.",
