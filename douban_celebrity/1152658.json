    "introduction": "Tall, lovely and spirited actress Robin Rochelle Stille was born on November 24, 1961 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Her parents were Jere Stille and Sarah Bridge. Stille had two sisters and one brother. She moved with her family to Los Angeles, California. Robin graduated from Garden Grove High School in Garden Grove, California in 1979. Stille gave a delightfully lively and engaging performance as the spunky and likable Valerie 'Val' Bates in the wonderfully trashy tongue-in-cheek slasher cult classic \"The Slumber Party Massacre.\" Robin was deliciously nasty and hateful as wicked and venomous head sorority sister Babs Peterson in the amusingly silly \"Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-A-Rama.\" She made a guest appearance on an episode of the TV series \"Jake and the Fatman.\" Stille's last movie role was as Peace Corps nurse Sarah in \"American Ninja 4: The Annihilation.\" Robin was the mother of twin sons Justin and Joshua Creadick. Stille reportedly had a serious drinking problem which might have contributed to her untimely death by suicide on February 9, 1996 in Burbank, California. Robin was only 34 years old. Robin Stille was buried at Rose Hill Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.",
