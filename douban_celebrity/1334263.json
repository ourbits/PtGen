    "introduction": "Daniel Domscheit-Berg[needs IPA] (né Berg; born 1978), previously known under the pseudonym Daniel Schmitt, is a German technology activist.He is best known for stealing and destroying whistleblower organization Wikileaks unpublished documents and the website encrypted submission system.He is the author of Inside WikiLeaks: My Time with Julian Assange at the World's Most Dangerous Website (2011).After leaving WikiLeaks, he announced plans in January 2011 to open a new website for anonymous online leaks called OpenLeaks. At a Chaos Computer Club (CCC) event in August 2011, he announced its preliminary launch and invited hackers to test the security of the OpenLeaks system, as a result of which the CCC criticized him for exploiting the good name of the club to promote his OpenLeaks project and expelled him from their club, despite his lack of membership.This decision was revoked in February 2012.In September 2011, several news organizations cited Domscheit-Berg's split from Julian Assange and WikiLeaks as one of a series of events and errors that led to the release that month of all 251,287 United States diplomatic cables in the Cablegate affair.In 2011, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine in its FP Top 100 Global Thinkers, with Sami Ben Gharbia and Alexey Navalny.Since then he has lapsed into obscurity.",
