She then entered the École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs de Paris, where she discovered animation. Her final-year film, Sans queue ni tête, won the 2003 Cartoon d’or. She went on to make two short films produced by Les Films de l’Arlequin, Le thé de l’oubli (2008) and Bao (2011). In addition to being a filmmaker, Sandra is an illustrator of children’s books. Her most recent projects were Méandre, written by Muriel Bloch (2019, Éditions Le Robert), and Mai Anh, written by Didier Dufresne (2020, Éditions Mango). She also works as a comic book colourist for projects such as À mains nues, by Leïla Slimani and Clément Oubrerie (2020, Éditions Les Arènes). Sandra just finished shooting her most recent short film, Nhu môt dòng sông (Flowing Home).",
