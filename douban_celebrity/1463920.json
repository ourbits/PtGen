    "introduction": "Chris White is an award-winning filmmaker who has spent over a decade writing, directing, and producing a variety of feature length and short films. His most recent project is the music-centric, coming of age comedy Electric Jesus, which explores the world of a fictional 80's Christian hair metal band called 316. The band's journey from playing Bible camp talent shows to head-banging rock venues is an amusing look at youth culture during the time when heavy metal music was bathed in controversy. The film stars Brian Baumgartner (The Office), Judd Nelson (The Breakfast Club, St. Elmo's Fire), and newcomers Shannon Hutchinson (Assassinaut) and Andrew Eakle (Creepshow, The Glorias).",
