    "introduction": "Paul John Weller (born John William Weller; 25 May 1958) is an English singer-songwriter and musician. Weller achieved fame with the rock band the Jam in the late 1970s. Following the dissolution of the Jam in 1982, he pursued different musical styles in the Style Council (1983–1989), then became a solo artist with his eponymous 1992 studio album.Despite widespread critical recognition as a singer, lyricist, and guitarist, Weller has remained a national—rather than international—star, and much of his songwriting is rooted in English society. Many of his songs with the Jam had lyrics about working class life.He was the principal figure of the 1970s and 1980s mod revival, often referred to as the Modfather,and an influence on Britpop bands such as Oasis.He has received four Brit Awards, including Best British Male three times, and the Brit Award 2006 for Outstanding Contribution to Music.",
