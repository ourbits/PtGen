    "introduction": "Justin \"Jay\" Starrett is a contestant from Survivor: Millennials vs. Gen X.Despite his laid-back personality, Jay proved to be a serious threat during his season, orchestrating the blindside of Michaela Bradshaw, winning two individual Immunity Challenges, and finding a Hidden Immunity Idol. During the merge, his affiliation with the Triforce alliance and his physical prowess during challenges made him a target. He managed to outlast the rest of his alliance in part due to a unique rivalry/friendship with Adam Klein, but was ultimately eliminated on Day 36 after he mistakenly played a fake idol made by David Wright.",
