    "introduction": "Born in Bandung, Indonesia, Tania Gunadi moved to LA when she won a green card lottery. She began her career as an actress when a friend invited her to go along on an audition for a Disneyland commercial, where to her delight, she booked the role and was hooked on acting. Not long after that, she landed television and film roles for both live action and animation shows including Transformers Prime, Aaron Stone, The Magic of Ordinary Days, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Bizaardvark, Enlisted, Penn Zero, Trese, Pixel Perfect, DC Super Hero Girls, and Avatar Generations. In 2024-2025 you can see her on Curb Your Enthusiasm and on Disney's STUGO.Alongside her love for acting and storytelling, Tania has recently been exploring her desire to write. Having spent the last couple of years learning from professional writers, she finished her first screenplay entitled Teddy, a story about a man and his dog. That said, she is thrilled at being the winner of the 2024 Cassian Elwes Screenwriting Fellowship at the Sundance Film Festival.",
