    "introduction": "Eric Amadio is an Italian-American writer, director, and producer, known for Snowfall (2017), After Sex (2007) and Stuntmen (2009). Born in Southeast Los Angeles and raised during the height of violence in the crack-fueled 80's and 90's, Eric had his first essay published at the age of 10, went on to write for local music publication Rock City News at 16, then worked as an electronic music producer/DJ from ages 18-23 before beginning his career in film and television. Deeply rooted in Los Angeles, his grandfather, an undocumented immigrant from Italy, opened one of the first Italian-American owned photo studios in Downtown LA in the 1940's, his mother grew up in the middle of the 1950's car-culture in Bell, and Eric's formative years were spent immersed in the various 80's/90's subcultures of hip hop, skateboarding, basketball, and crime, all elements that can be found in his work.",
